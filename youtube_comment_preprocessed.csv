lets not forget that apple pay in required a brand new iphone in order to use it a significant portion of apples user base wasnt able to use it even if they wanted to as each successive iphone incorporated the technology and older iphones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased,1
here in nz of retailers don t even have contactless credit card machines like paywave which support apple pay they don t like the high fees that come with these,0
i will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations now its quite helpful while youll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account growth,2
whenever i go to a place that doesn t take apple pay doesn t happen too often it s such a drag between contactless covid habits and my getting the apple card i ve gotten so used to apple pay that i get seriously annoyed when a store doesn t take it it feels like a shock it s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i ve officially been brainwashed by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,0
apple pay is so convenient secure and easy to use i used it while at the korean and japanese airports no need for physical credit cards,2
we ve been hounding my bank to adopt apple pay i understand why they don t want to do it with the extra fees but its just so easy and quick at the checkout,1
we only got apple pay in south africa in and it s widely accepted,2
for now i need both apple pay and the physical credit card,1
in the united states we have an abundance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still good to carry the physical card with you being there are still a large quantity of places that do not accept apple pay,2
in cambodia we have a universal qr code system we scan and send money back and forth all banks take no profit from merchant they receive of the payment a lot of stores and supermarkets start abandon pos machine all together,1
wow you really went to town on the psu test rack thats a serious bit of kit very flexible good choices wouldnt surprise me if choma start offering this bespoke rack to the psu makers they all watch your videos so theyll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack you can really push the industry here well done open source the test interface hardware and software,2
the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured,2
linus im an engineer and love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles,2
there used to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make linus look like a child kudos to linus and lmg youve grown beyond what i imagined all the best,2
holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was designing power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements bit adcs they are just for looking at the waveforms,0
i love the direction this channel is going most tech channels even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is love it,2
i am more excited for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running,2
i adore the working relationship linus has with his team of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and i wish it could be more like this,2
lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in depth engineering oriented and sciencebased content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picked it which helps greatly with buyers remorse,2
i love all the people ltt has added for labs clearly theyre knowledgeable and passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it,2
linus just turn the key lights and bounce them off the walls you ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it s such a simple fix i m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face,2
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,2
dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,2
linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgraded setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this video was hilarious,2
linus this is not a table also linus lets use this as a chair,1
dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,2
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,2
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,2
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,2
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at b,2

guys a quick note that you do not need all the highend tech in order to do well at college if you can and you should save as much money as you can while at college pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for years such as laptop dont overspend on phone headphones lamps tablets etc,1
this is hilarious i was in a focus group over years ago for best buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for back to school one of the kids next to me said maybe you should have someone like mkbhd talk about your products well here we are,1
everyone has been saying it but i ll throw my hat in as well to any prospective college students you do not need to spend money on flagship products i am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a year old laptop and the base ipad from late both products have worked flawlessly and i have no intention of replacing them the recommendations listed are ones i would never be able to afford even with my job i m working as well do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is i promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,2
shoutout to my oneplus phone and huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for much less bonus ups for ikeas articulating lamps and i can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain the old door i refinished to use as a desktop and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my noisecancelling headphones and the same sets of hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride,2
best buy we want to sponsor a back to school type video but you can only push the high end stuff marques say less,1
most of the items you recommend are pretty pricey for a student im not a student myself anymore but if i were one more budget alternatives would make this video a lot better,1
you dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for university i used a macbook pro throughout my years at uni had an iphone and it worked out just fine whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,2
personally i feel like this is really out of touch most students wont be able to afford these in case anyone needs it i believe dave ds back to school video are honestly the best ones ive seen on the topic consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,2
hey everyone good take on the video and love the recommendations if you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options what i can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education engineering students require computer specs that can run bim software im not sure about the other programmes but from what i can see that most students at my place has gb of ram for their laptops also here is my setup during my university years hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years all the best laptop asus x l upgraded to ssd with additional ram phone vivo y redmi samsung a g mouse logitech g keyboard tecware tkl ver,2
i have used galaxy tab s during my phd its been a lifesaver for me first of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with tab s and lastly if you are from a stem background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on tab s i choose tab s over apple ipad air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with tab s and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,2
when he says hes a year old beer wizard i believe him,1
this series is exactly what career day shouldve been such interesting and knowledgeable people,2
regarding cans vs bottles at least in germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly since they get used again and again you bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop they then get sent to a cleaning plant where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water afterwards they get reused for beer the size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard so different brewers use the same bottles its far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans,1
how does every person wired brings on this show act like theyve been in front of cameras times,0
idk who s picking these people but give them a raise,1
his face when describing hops killed me some of them smell pretty dank,0
seasoned craft brewery tour guide here and i m so glad he ended on drink what you like sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others at the end of the day there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason so everyone can find at least one style they actually like,2
this guy is a total bro not snobby at all and just wants people to enjoy beer in whatever way they want such a contrast with your stereotypical beverage elitists,2
y all be picking the literal best professionals for these videos not only is everyone knowledgeable but they all seem passionate and eager to teach us,2
this guy has a face made for movies a voice made for radio and a great personality i wanna see more of garrett,2
whenever we get people young enough to actually understand the internet these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have year old senators asking tech ceos how the internet works nothing will get done,0
i live for johns roasts of att,2
mad respect to john oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show major props,2
one important aspect im surprised was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost of the websites on the internet are stored on amazon servers giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet,2
shout to you john oliver for giving me a brief trip down memory lane ive been in the telecommunications industry for almost years and my first job was atmci great company that got swallowed up in a horrible merger with worldcom bing it and see how that disaster played out,1
back in when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know,0
john oliver deserves an oscar for his can dolphins love you monologue,2
i would love to see these bills live i live in a country where we had one company try and rule the internet charging outrageous prices for it they had specifically bought the copper network to do it the government of nz denied that as a defense as they were monopolising it and forced them to open up suddenly it turned out it didnt cost to connect to unlimited internet you could get that for,1
hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,0
points that were missed apple arguably has a specific monopoly in the us with smartphones because of imessage not being open with other multiplatform messaging apps this weirdly only applies in the states the rest of the world favours things like whatsapp and facebook messenger both owned by meta which is its own issue thats probably the main defence apple will bring up theyve been in trouble before but dont forget about microsoft windows has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove this kind of got glossed over but although google play takes the same cut for purchases as apple you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like so they avoid the heat there google play is still the most preferred store on android phones so google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software,1
hey hey just a heads up i did turn the led hoodie on its just not very bright hen youre looking faceon at it you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though if you had fun on this video heres my collection of extreme unboxing videos,2
the safety belt wouldve paired perfectly with the unicycle and those roller boot things,2
that was seriously the most enjoyable thing ive seen in awhile i forgot how rad this channel is well done sir,2
dude i love how genuine your reactions were ive had fun watching this and not only i was really interested to see what each one of those gadgets did,2
infinity dodecahedrons are seriously cool i bought another smaller one and i really enjoy it its definitely an eye catcher and a conversation starter,2
i personally enjoy the old school phones i have such a hard time hearing my iphone at max volume without the speaker on if i worked in an office i would definitely buy one people forget how ergonomic those old phones are its not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head i also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones ear phones whatever cause me a bunch of pain looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone,2
the fact he didnt buy the nicholas cage spoon is outrageous,0
i have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey youre on this year has been effective it simply feels like youre enjoying life and its what i enjoy most about watching your videos you manage to pass that joy on just the musings of a random stranger,2
i havent laughed like this for years oh my gosh arun youve nailed this one wendi,2
quality quality quality is everything about this channel arun makes my mood happier video after video lets be searious the best part about this channel is arun making his jokes and when he shows tech,2
spin launch graphene gps floating farms edge computing selfhealing concrete hydrogen fuel cells satellite constellations gpt connected homes lithium metal battery d printing blockchain fighting fire with sound quantum computing,1
if machines produce everything we need the outcome will depend on how things are distributed everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machineproduced wealth is shared or most people can end up miserably poor if the machineowners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution so far the trend seems to be toward the second option with technology driving everincreasing inequality stephen hawking,1
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,0
edge of the cloud hydrogen fuel cell star link ai gpt lithium ion battery block chain quantum computing,1
selfhealing concrete is on paper a really good idea there is just one small problem with it and comes from the fact that we are not using limestone for buildings as limestone has this one tiny problem with being rather frail yes it will make the concrete last a big longer but it will also make it harder to see where the weaknesses of the structure is and only really postpone the disaster if at all,1
ive read that hydrogen can work its way through any container material in your piece about graphen it was stated that it is impermiable to gases even the lightest one assuming the narrator meant hydrogen it might be a solution to the long term storage of hydrogen perhaps,1
the fire suppression without water was incredible it could save many lives and property especially if it could be auto activated like a heat detector imagine how much property and how many sleeping people could be saved especially if this had a built in alarm and was rigged to keep hallways clear of fire what an inventionwow,2
id really appreciate a study into the potential advantages of meta materials in manipulating light emf heat and even replacing silicon as semiconductors nearly every industry can benefit from the improvements and cost reductions meta materials can provide really enjoy your videos thank you,2
i was totally shocked that fusion power generation wasnt included possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity,0
i love the one about the hydrogen fuel cellsconsidering this technology has been around for about yearsjust hasnt been used due to a lack of pressure on the industry and the fact that the patent was buried by large corporate interests,2
i like the meme that says if it bites you and you die it s venomous if you bite it and you die it s poisonous i actually think it sums it up pretty clearly,1
i wish that when people talked about types of skin damage theyd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin we dont get red rashes after sunburn even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we dont see the same change in colors around the wound sight not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues,0
she has a very effective way of delivering information in a way that is accessible love her,2
if the lead singer is bret michaels then im sure it is poison that had me laughing for ages,2
anne is so cool she makes me want to reevaluate my life choices and return to college to become a toxicologist,2
poison support is one of the more interesting ones of this series im glad to see anne back in the seat and schooling us hoping for more,2
my son had botox injections in his legs for years to relax his muscles enough so he could wear splits he has cerebral palsy its crazy knowing that this life changing treatment is also the most dangerous poison,0
my mom wouldve gone nuts for you while i was growing up lol her big parent fear was toxic chemicals and me getting poisoned so she was always lecturing me about stuff under the sink and making sure i didnt touch the pesticides for the farm once she figured out she could call pbs and theyd send her mr yuck stickers the house and barn were covered in them,0
i love how she says that it is poison in the right dose instead of the wrong dose,2
my husband got sun poisoning last year all the symptoms you described it was not fun he said his sick were he got burned felt tight for a few months after luckily he is a nurse and he was able to give me advice on how to help him in his recovery,0
the monitor looks pretty average size until marques reaches his whole extended arm towards it and points out the screen size and suddenly you realize it s a monitor,1
marques does a fantastic job highlighting the features of the link if youre looking for the next level of webcam look no further dope tech dope video,2
the camera is amazing and there are so many people who could benefit from it a lot,2
i ve been playing with the insta link for about a week now as a college professor and edtech trainer i can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online and hybrid teaching switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to topdown mode for demos etc is a purely magical experience,2
i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive for that monitor isnt as bad as i was expecting and its almost reasonable like its still more than i would ever spend on a single display and im far more into having separate displays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behind it etc its not that bad i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,2
imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it,0
this monitor is perfect for streaming three monitors in one is amazing but man is it expensive,2
i can see this being good for editing and streaming reading the chat and playing the game on one screen this is genius,2
geez i need a dedicated studio for all of this dope tech in my future,2
this has gotta be one of the best dope techs everything here is a hit that i m def writing down for later,2
i m always looking forward to these every month so thank you for making them honestly that little lamp and speaker caught my eye the flickering is really cool to me and the speaker is a nice extra,2
the sound test killed me that was hilarious and the wrist rest is brilliant i often get marks on my wrist from my mousepad,2
what a tough selection this month whether it be the soundbar the lamp speaker or even the pc panel display they all seem something that would really improve my set up but for me it may have to be the soundbar one looks smart has nice rgb and a decent size and price very good month of tech this month,2
i absolutely love this series all of the items were neat but the only one i would actually benefit from would be the chair wheels i have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet and it is kind of a pain,2
that sensor panel is definitely convenient been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just find myself getting off track super cool to just be able to purchase and go,2
the rgb sound bar would be perfect for my setup i ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main sound system so it would be a nice upgrade for me,2
i always love franks energy i also look forward to the end of every month thinking about this series i love the tiltednation soundbar and i need that for my set up,2
always great to see this series so many cool things this month my office setup could use those chair wheels,2
this series has helped me and my friends find some helpful tech that has helped our setups the pc panel is gonna be a huge upgrade,2
we need the under for august as well this is the best series out there,2
one really important point those ionizers can produce potentially dangerous levels of ozone due to the negative ions they create in the air id be cautious of all air ionizers unless they are advertised specifically as bipolar ionizers the one that you recommended does produce ozone which can be very harmful,0
been a good while since ive been a student but i still watched the vid to find out what cool gadgets are out there didnt think id be walking away from it with a productivity tip that idea of the simple timer is so good instead of devices that can also do time great vid frank,2
the desktop lamp is definitely my favorite it s also something i ve been looking for because i updated to a keyboard that doesn t have shine through keycaps so it s definitely a need too,2
i m not a student however i always love seeing the tech always looking to change and upgrade my desk setup for work,2
fantastic video frank you always bring really cool stuff to the front that most of us havent seenheard anything about hope you and the fam are doing well xd btw that kb for only i know theyve gotten a lot cheaper but hot damn i dont need it but i want it lol my biggest complaint with kbs is the lack of arrow keys and this has those and looks super sleek with those colors love it take care man,2
ugh hate when my summer holidays end at least you brighten my mood with this top tech series thanks,2
the forest app is a phone based timer app basically you set a timer for however long you want to be focused for at the beginning it will plant a virtual tree in the app if you leave the forest app at all it will kill your tree,1
awesome variety of products i also like that you had more than five or six items love the budget finds,2
you missed a feature on the airbolt instead of using the big part of the loop to lock your zippers lock the zippers on the loop where the notches are that way you cant open the bag inches,0
its so crazy to me ive watched you all the way through middle school till college now over six years and youve grown so much keep working big man reguardless of your age middle school highschool collegeuniversity we gotchu covered,2
for all the coffee lovers don t forget to check out cometeer and save on your first order watch best gifts under,2
the kablecard is by far my favorite item on this list when i first saw you have it on the channel i immediately bought it so easy to carry and being able to charge anything with it is great,2
i just wanted to say thank you for making such amazing content we notice all the hard work you do and appreciate it so much,2
as a specialty coffee lover those cometeer pods are amazing if i didnt enjoy the long process it takes to brew a fresh cup of coffee id buy them all the time,2
i wasn t prepared for the immediate start lol,0
thanks for consistently providing great videos every time i purchase a new device i come to your channel to find out the best products for it,2
love these accessories you always make great videos,2

love watching your videos just waiting for that best accessories for pixel video,2
love your vids mankeep up the good work,2
be careful with the katchy they are known to start smoking at the top so possible fire hazard its possible that this issue could have been fixed with the newer models but just giving you a heads up great video,2
am i the only one that actually watches these with snacks and drinks been here since,2
gotta let your son pick some boxes now he s old enough to point one out start him in the family business early,2
i love all the interactions and laughs with everyone in this video personally i think j picked the best tech,2
okay j that was definitely worth it i might get me one a good buy for a traveling tech head,2
still the best series to watch while indulging in a meal cant believe its already the th video,2
i absolutely love your wife s expressions when she s interacting with you another gundam play games with you giggle cracks me up,2
thanks for the heads up about grover im a tech reviewer and had never heard of it could be a really nice way for me to get my hands on some items to review very appreciated,2
i love you guys i hope you know that you guys brighten my day with these massive tech unboxing videos,2
the whole idea of the interchangeable battery to keep going of the steel series is exactly the reason why xbox still uses aa batteries for their controllers i think is in an undervalued decision from xbox,0
in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesnt produce improved rewards it produces more work the response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus instead good work is rewarded with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all its worth young people are almost never treated as the companys future,0
i am years old working in the high tech industry mentally tired and sick of the weekly to routine never got a proper day off even through the pandemic hats off to the millenials and genz that think differently and put more weight on living rather than just working,0
i think the pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn t mean security,0
successful people dont become that way overnight what most people see at a glance wealth a great career purposeis the result of hard work and hustle over time i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,2
as someone who used to work hours a week quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing i have ever done sure i still work a lot of hours and often close to hrs a week i feel like i am doing this for myself and not some corporation,2
i have a high paying tech job that i m about to leave i feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though i worked hard to get to where i am i was promoted very fast after years i know it s something many people would love to have and honestly i m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life i have lived humbly saved every thing i could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for months to a year i m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your dream and get one you can do it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me don t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too,2
i m a software developer i understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars we are very privileged to be where we are most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress i am grateful everyday to be in this field once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom i ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to,2
the thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,2
compare that to physicians only said they were burned out yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,2
i worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused you can barely keep up though i got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that i was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially i branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as i am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic i maxed out at k so i decided to jump ship with little planned now i run a financial agency with my husband and we make k a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,0
stratosfera acquatica inmo air shine crown meural canvas ii octav atmos wyn bullet splach transformer squeaky clean feet,1
that boat pod looks a lot like a saiyan space capsule i need one lol,2
those window breakers seems like an easy way to rob someone s car,0
ok cool the ball boat my question is how do you launch it traditional boats come off a trailer when you dip them in the water looks to me as if you need a crane for the ball boat,1
anyone else notice how much the wyn bullet resembles a firing pin if you have ever built your own firearms you know the time and effort that goes into a firing pin with all of heating and cooling it takes to harden the steel and how easy it is to over harden the firing pin and no its not feasible to soften a over hardened firing pin,1
i would love the glasses and the digital artwork frame,2
that canvas one wouldn t be a bad price if you didn t have to pay for a monthly membership,1
cool,2
nice i love it,2
damn the mueral canvas is nice too pricey,0
if you could limit your products to things that are available retail it would be awesome kickstarter and indiegogo etc dont count too many scams and failed products and no protections,0
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,2
this guy must be the richest youtuber i hear his voice on most tech channel,2
that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor pick up the laptop and perhaps step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip,0
that cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,2
the trene control alarm will not deter someone who really wants it they will just knock that gadget off and run with your property,0
for anyone considering the vaultek lifepod there is a video on the lockpickinglawyer channel where he opens the safe with a fork dont waste your money,1
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up,2
i like the engraver but when i went to check price i found it was just a kickstarter,1
i spent hours researching dash cams a year or so ago and it s almost maddening how awful sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is i was totally surprised how under developed they are this is a video that is really necessary,0
vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams well done in the research thanks ltt,2
a favourite trick is to upscale a low resolution image before applying the compression that way they get to claim a higher resolution on the box ive analysed a few of these now,1
i did not expect to love this video as much as i did it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellmade video with a wellconstructed narrative hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these products love your work ltt team,2
thank you linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommendations in mind when i purchase my camera,2
this is the kind of content that we need calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers doing the sidebyside comparisons they cant do thanks for this glad to know the rove r k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is good enough if not overpriced a bit,2
yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country in germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within south korea japan if anybody could give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great dashcams right japan being the leading technology country in the s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind i bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine problem i have with it is quality related the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings and in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope its your f dashcam you can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ndfilter you just have to find your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i didnt do this yet as i did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure videos fahrn nftig german amazon thieye cv american market jansite nexigo d australian nz market volway,2
in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth considering over the thinkware f if the budget isnt too tight,2
when i went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause i really dont think the batteries would handle the to c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system for actual performance its much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading unless you really know your camera sensor specs,0
i had my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it sounds like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in im tired of all these countless trash brands on amazon with unpronounceable names,0
ive been wanting to make this video for such a long time that royole display was just so hard to get hold of by holy cow was it worth it to check out my other ridiculous tech unboxings,0
i love the fact that you put thinnest rick roll and can you legally employ a cat on the search history even if it flashed on the screen for a second you are one of the only creators that put effort and detail into their content keep it up,2
his search history thinnest windows laptop thinnest keyboard world s thinnest mouse thinnest charger is it legal to employ a cat can cats edit youtube videos thinnest rickroll in the world thinnest rick astley,1
i d say the coolest thing in this video is the desk pc saves room and it s cool to see the desk but i wonder how much it cost and if it s worth buying,2
im just here to say thank you to him the generosity he has shown will forever be in my heart thanks for the perfect job,2
i own a remarkable and that feeling surreal to hold was the same thing i felt when i got it its great for anyone wanting a device to write with for school and so much thinner and easier to carry around than a notebook or binder especially since you can import and export pdfs for downloading and submitting assignments online,2
man i love how he went from a smartphone focused creator to just all inventions overall this is incredible keep it up arun,2
thankyou for the effort you put into your videos you spend thousands on each video just for your fans respect,2
that desk pc is now on my bucket list,2
i love the fact that you put hilarious search histories at this is the kind of content youtubers need to make keep up the good work,2
install raid for free iosandroidpc and get a special starter pack available only for the next days this is the best iphone accessory in like these wallpapers download them here iphone magsafe accessories,2
in spite of the huge upgrades especially for the pro models it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iphone lineup given that the iphone lineup is as popular as ever,2
honestly can t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros as a iphone user anything will be an improvement though lol,2
i ve been holding out cause i just felt it wasn t worth upgrading but with everything coming to the pro and the diminishing battery on my current iphone x it might be time to retire my phone after years,1
definitely upgrading from my pro max to the pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in major upgrade in battery camera and the screen,2
in my opinion the mini is the best phone ever made seems i m in a minority but it s brilliant,2
eh i m sticking with my pro max until probably the or the cameras on the pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo,2
im going to wait for the scheduled iphone pro which will be scheduled to release in october if everything goes to plan it is expected to have a usb c port and faster charging like the iphone series this is what really matters for me,2
im getting the pro been using the pro max since it came out and i think its too big for one hand use,1
i might upgrade from my pro to the max i guess i don t care enough to spend the money on the pro max but i want the bigger display and better battery life,2
the information is easily digestible thanks,2
i think we need to have period support with a gynecologist next im dying to answer some period health questions,1
this guy is so professional and has such a calm aura about him exactly what i would like my doctor to have,2
this guy is just wonderful i like that sense of humor in a doctor dr what is wrong with me yes,2
i had a great time with these questions thanks wired,2
no just you actually got me i love how they choose professionals with such great fun and easy going personalitiesit makes science a little less nerdy,2
seriously how are these weird topics so engaging probably the professionals they feature but this is a fantastic series,2
as someone with ulcerative colitis im glad to see gastrointestinal issues being put on the spotlight as well as a specialist educating people on this taking care of yourself before it becomes chronic is key,2
had the pleasure of working at the same practice as dr iroku during his time in nc he truly is just as nice in person as he appears in this video so nice to see a familiar face,2
dr iroku has nailed perfect balance of being fun and informative while remaining professional perfect for this series,2
reminder do not fall for the fake telegram and whatsapp accounts trying to have you claim a prize through texting them its fake and a scam i personally contact the winners through my official account only,0
this was one of the best cool tech episodes in a while wow that pocket operator was awesome and i dont even make music,2
led message panel k k hdmi switcher womier phantom keyboard pocket operator behringer um audio interface,1
i used to have that audio interface for those who wanna switch from a usb mic to xlr great choice of items this month frank,2
love those pocket operators never heard of them until this video and now ive done a ton of research on em lol would like to pick one up someday thanks for bringing this dope tech to our attention good sir,2
that led message board is super cool so many options for use love watching your videos and seeing all of the cool affordable tech,2
love the wormier keyboard i have a full size keyboard and the compact option looks amazing and will be a better fit for my small desk,2
i love how theres infinite possibilities that you can do with the pocket operator would love to pick up one of those for exploring it,2
my favorite cool tech gadget in this episode was definitely the audio interface as i am starting to get into the streaming world great episode and for the amazing content,2
gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while i actually think every single one of these things would be something id go out to buy especially the led sign i finally am picking back up my plan to build my own pc and the flexibility of the sign adds a lot of well flexibility on how i want my endgame to turn out,2
teachers there are no stupid questions wolfgang puck well tracey thats a stupid question,0
hes a nice fun guy he told my dad at an event my dad was cooking at that he had never seen so many steaks cooked so perfectly so quickly and its one of his favorite memories we have a signed picture with him and my parents in it d,2
he seems like such a fun person omg keep calm and smoke a joint let me teach you english tracy that s a stupid question idk what school you re going to but maybe you should change schools im dead,1
idk if this was intentional but i really like how he said practice makes better rather than practice makes perfect,2
have a drink or smoke a joint thanks chef i ll do both,2
if you settle a lemon a great cheesecake and a chocolate souffl in a circle and chant restauranteur three times in a mirror wolfgang puck will appear behind you,1
i think its kinda cool that elizabeth haigh sent the tweet about nervous breakdowns the same month she opened her restaurant and now that her question is being answered she has a michellin star,2
i like that he mentioned the omelette thing many years ago i took culinary classes when i considered trying to become a chef and an instructor i had emphasized the importance of a good omelette for restaurant interviews glad to know i wasnt led astray in that,2
i can t wait to put edible flowers all over my morning cheerios,2
i love how hes wearing a bracelet that says allergic to stupidity,2
the price of todays bikes is absolutely bonkers doesnt make any sense whatsoever if you compare it to motorcycles or even cars,0
the price of the roadgoing kawasaki really tells how overpriced the push bikes are,0
fun fact about horsepower its the amount of power a horse can sustain for an entire day so a galloping horse actually has horsepower,2
i love and ride both types of two wheeled transportation gcntech your talking my language,2
another great video two thumbs up i know little to nothing about about motorcycle riding nevertheless the gcn team once again has brought another layer to overall world of cycling which for me makes even more interesting wishing the best for scott his team,2
this was a fascinating look at something i love by some genuinely interested people i will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike for a lower key series and still have fun on the track i have a minitwin which is relatively cheap to run but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it it costs about k and six months at least to fix however i far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track all of which you can do on a minitwin,2
next week on battle of the tech hank vs golden retriever,1
you left off the most important consideration how many bottle holders do you have,1
hopefully you were able to interview some of the riders who train on bicycles,1
as a lapsed superbike obsessive it always bothered me hearing gcn call top road bikes superbikes now i mostly watch cycling and im used to it,0
hanging onto my t for now curious to see what oneplus does after the overall coz the didnt move me they keep constantly moving from what made them great with each variant the oneplus being their last great phone,2
i ve always wondered what it s like for a tech reviewer to be constantly switching phones would love to see a how i set up my phone from a tech reviewer type video or something similar,1
i m waiting for the oneplus s or p or q,2
pretty happy with the oneplus camera is killer for sunny days on the beach the oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand,2
oneplus have been making some solid looking hardware these days that being said it does feel like they have been sort of trying to become the next samsung with the number of phones that they have been launching,2
you are the only youtuber who compared these two phones for the first time thank you so much,2
always here for u chris mad respect,2
oppo did oneplus so dirty heart breaks for oneplus fans rip oxygen os and oneplus,0
man oneplus is in the wrong direction after carl pei left from flagship killer to forgettable company,0
depends on the company lol my company was on a hiring freeze from and now is hiring software engineers en masse,1
nice one zoe great job keep us up to date on the latest computer programming news great job,2
lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees honestly who hasn t seen this coming,0
its just usual trimming of the fluff when excess liquidity is withdrawn its important to do it before you get to the down rounds that way vcs can decide which baby chicks to feed and which ones to shove out of the nest,1
what slowdown lol it was abnormally fast and now with the recession vcs realized many of these startups aren t profitable so they laid off people the big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon,0
i work in cybersecurity it hasn t slowed down much because you can t just stop securing your systems,1
slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind,0
thats really a problem with service economy most tech companies dont even produce a nail they do things that are intangible you cay easily live without them if netflix goes down i am sure there will not be any catastrophic event if some manufacturing companies goes down lets say the one that makes baby formula it could trigger a panic,0
startups and bitcoin tech definitely hiring freeze at big tech companies maybenah you still get regular churnovers that free up positions especially now where ppl switch jobs every yrs can you imagine a world without amazon google microsoft what are ppl gonna do switch to linux and roll with libra office and vim,1
good video as usual,2
the future of tech is looking more and more amazing,2
the future of tech is soo beautiful,2
good day future tech i noticed your excellent video and am impressed with your amazing sharing on products wed love to collab on a new product experience were working on what would be the best email to contact you,2
could coolper become the average new yorker s dream hmm make that every coffee lover can t help but notice pixy s here again a nice hands free it is,2
russell westbrook need this,1
meters per hour jezus i might just walk ps please include rough prices,1
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up for the support of your channel,2
so im guessing when you make an ad for your product do you really want a guy sleeping right in the middle with an it is what it is pillow lol while everyone else is having fun and that blistering scooter speed of meters per hour i think you meant kilometers per hour all in all pretty cool stuff i like the coolper i can really see that taking off huupe seems to be novelty i can imagine the horror as soon as someone forgets there is a tv there and slams a ball only to shatter the device lol the life straw actually works ive seen several science channels take pond water and view it under a microscope then filter it and view it again it really does work but it does not filter out chemicals in the water just microparticles and microbes,2
im over this channel because of the products they feature in their videos are on kickstarter and honestly at this point they should change the name from kick starter to never starter lol im just saying as im also laughing my butt off because that was hella funny and its also hella true and yes it was also hella shady as well sorry i couldnt help myself anyway back to my point because trust me its a really good point and just in case youre still laughing let me get you back on track so like i said of the products featured on this channel and its sister channel or products that are on kickstarter and about to of the products on kickstarter never even make it to market thats right you read that correct and my numbers are correct because i did my research so basically this channel future tech and its sister channel the future is now both channels are useless because over of the products that they show you you will never ever be able to purchase so basically honestly its a waste of everybodys youtube time unless you like looking at videos that feature products and gadgets that will never come to market and that you will never be able to purchase seriously on being funny and sarcastic but also serious because honestly im so over it and im over this channel thats why i have unsubscribe and im telling everybody else to unsubscribe so have you unsubscribed please everybody unsubscribe because at this point in time future tech and the future is now and all those channels that display products that are on kickstarter and the keyword here is display because basically all the products are prototypes that are on display and the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market oh kickstarter oops im sorry i mean never starter oh my god im sorry i couldnt help myself because its still so funny lol but like i said these products never end up going to market and never end up being sold so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time and your time and everybody elses time okay now guess what times up so goodbye and remember everybody please do yourself a big favor and unsubscribe,2
awesome,2
this lady is awesome her voice makes my throat hurt but i could watch her for hours,2
for all people after covid who want their smell back i did exactly what she described but went a step further and tried to smell back first smells i used to hate or made me want to puke i feel that it trully helped getting my smell back faster the hate in our brain is a true booster it just triggers something xd please let me know if it worked for you too wishing all a speed recovery,2
it still blows my mind that companies have entire teams deciding whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses and yet somehow swedish fish flavored oreos were still greenlit,0
interesting note real wasabi is difficult to cultivate and package and ship it also grows only in a specific riverbank environment which makes real wasabi expensive and in low supply when young real wasabi is a bit sweet not spicy the wasabi that comes with your sushi dinner in america it is most often just horseradish with green food coloring this greendyed horseradish replacing actual wasabi is known in the food world as an ersatz or a replica food,1
that section of the tongue theory is so funny to me because it s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and i was trying to test that out on my own and never could i would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never heard anyone say it wasn t true so it s cool to hear now,2
this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a phd in taste and i want her to be my professor i m a lawyer and after this one video i m prepared to quit and pursue taste,2
what she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think delivery pizza smells so good and it s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box,2
when i was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake five flavors taste zones thing and i never got it i could always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teachers face can i,0
the amount of people wired gets to interview is amazingall of them has the passion of the kinds of job they r doing idk if job is the right word to use when ua doing something what u love,2
also the amount of carbonation to syrup isnt set in the soda machines and can be changed a soda with more carbonation is a dry soda a restaurant i loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet whichever was your preference,2
maybe its because i know shes an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible,2
i m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker as someone who has had two of them since i ve been four i ve had to explain that so many times also having automatic bluetooth ears is super cool,2
my doctor also told me that our ears are selfcleaning but when i pressured her for some offtherecord advice she finally conceded that if i really really felt the need to clean inside my ear canal i could go ahead and use my elbows i just adore my doctor,2
brilliant wellspoken wellenunciated and a welcoming and animated face great video i learned a lot,2
the way i was hyped to to this i was born with hearing loss so i had to see many audiologist in my life so far people like her made my life so much easier her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear,2
about earplugs at concerts there are a variety of frequencybalanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music eargasm and hearos are a couple of examples i highly recommend them,2
as someone who has been to many loud concerts and been in infantry combat and is now nearing you should wear hearing protection whenever you can same as sun protection for skin and sun glasses for your eyes,1
honestly my main take away is that ive been saying tinnitus wrong my whole life,0
loved this as someone who previously studied to be an audiologist in the past also just love all of the expert answers videos on this channel thanks wired and dr emily,2
this was super fascinating although the part about the ear drum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me,2
the universal hate for printers is what unites humanity,0
i suddenly gained immense amount of respect for dyson after watching this,2
im just shocked and saddened that theyve ignored the most significant vacuum cleaner advance the retractable cord,0
you know you ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction,2
james dyson is actually giving really good advice here a lot of these types of qas give really generic advice,2
its a printer lol doesnt even matter what kind of printer everyone can relate,1
probably the best interviewanswers so far he leaps off the screen with his eloquent and articulate manner it is very apparent that he is simply a genius,2
this was so entertaining i had no idea the person behind dyson was a true genuine and passionate inventor and to see him speak so nicely about independent designers and the unfair problems they face was amazing,2
james dyson makes legendary household appliances like vacums and hair dryers also james dyson loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper the little things in life,2
i really wish we could see his full answers i imagine this was a much longer video that had to be edited down release the directors cut,1
your videos make my weekend it is something perfect that i can watch with my yearold what we have lunch and it distracts him because his mom is leaving to work your videos honestly are lifesavers thank you,2
for the th video you should let austin choose a box,1
i got the remarkable as a note takingplanner its has a great design really lightweight and better than carrying a note book or two subscription depending who you are are a hit a miss,2
must admit that new mx master mechanical keyboard looks and sounds great thinking of getting myself one of them now,2
this man really does love gundam respect,2
man the grid studios is my favorite tech that is definitely something to get i got it on my christmas list this year i like the remarkable until i see the price tag thats the remarkable part they can get away with selling it for prices that rival apple products,2
jay had whole lotta energy on this video,2
as per usual your unboxing videos make me happy actually all of them thanks again,2
i ve been looking at those remarkable tablets for a few years now i just can t justify the price when i can carry an old school notebook lol,1
thank you for the amazon voucher great content as always,2
hey by popular demand i made a list of all cool tech under products from the last years archived so you can see it all on page,2
my favorite product was definitely the wireless desk charger hope i can finally win one of these love your videos frank keep up the great work,2
on the wireless phone charger i could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job also the echo dot stand is super cute definitely made me think of portal turrets too definitely my favorite,2
loved the invisible charger would definitely contribute to keeping my clean,2
wow that wireless desk charger is insanely cool i would love one of those,2
this channel is actually really cool instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel,2
this might be the best episode of this series ever so many great ideas,2
the charger was my favorite the hidden feature is cool but what i really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,2
what an awesome video i love to see new affordable products come out this makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be produced at cheaper costs there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everydayused devices such as laptops or desktops,2
i love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus thanks for the best content as always,2
oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick the people animals and homes saved would be amazing not to mention the forests as well what a brilliant invention,2
that fire extinguisher could potentially be attached to drones to put out lightning strike fires and prevent future forest fires,1
imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like such as a mirror bench top or car windscreen and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror,2
in my opinion despite my fascination for the topic an exoskeleton is a an autonomous robot built around the human shape with the purpose of giving its pilot haha a sense of being superior while executing lowest work dependent on the mood of its programmersuperuser replacing the pilot when needed and sending all his collectable data to the company that is worried about our future with the best intentions take a look at this no picture it may now be real but every buster crabbe sci fi sorry buck rogers ans flash gordon bwseries is showing superior uniforms that look not half as clumsy and sluggish like this shown prosthesis,1
floating cities sound pretty promising as free land is already scarce the question is who will rescue the cities from violent storms or protect them from armed pirates a floating city will need its own defenses but will that be allowed within the mile territorial limit,1
it s awesome but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs,2
i want to know what problem that quantum computer solved in a few minutes that would take a normal computer years,1
ai is the most important one a lot of people think ai is going to somehow mean self awareness consciousness at some point the main implications of ai is that it is self improving the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen is that ai is going to overtake humans in a lot of things including research and science it is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change everything about life far more than the industrial era did for example years from now we can have an ai program that has been improving itself for years we lose about million people each year from car accidents and that is just fatalities there are also many more injuries so while i understand people being skeptical about machines driving cars as time goes on it is not even going to be close ai is going to be able to do many many things better than humans at some point these quantum computers are going to make ai they could program an ai to make a better ai of itself an improved version then the nd one can make a rd one that is better then it etc etc there is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens,1
the claim about the quantum computer came and went im not sure who is on top id like to see more of the chinese tech we seem to have very little insight into what they are doing,1
i can confirm her squirrel facts i raised an orphaned one and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal biting scratching trying to eat my face off it was a sad day but ive checked wanting a squirrel off my list,0
adore the collection of people you have answering questions they are so intelligent in their respective subject and superbly passionate love learning more,2
i swear to god every can i have this exotic pet question can just be answered with the words do you know what domestication is and how long it takes,0
some dogs will let you brush their teeth shows jack struggling vehemently against having his teeth brushed,1
declawing cats stop calling it declawing it has nothing to do with the claws as the vet said it is amputating the toes cats have claws if you have a problem with claws dont get a cat,0
thank you for addressing declawing cats and how awful and hurtful it is to the cat,0
i have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner he has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats he was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal,0
this woman was born to be a vet you can just tell shes the of kindergarten girls whos living the dream,2
exotic animals as pets should be illegal tigers dont belong in farms sugar gliders dont belong in apartments sad to see that this happens still,0
if you decide to brush a cats teeth a fencing mask is highly recommended,2
let us know your tech queries using askgcntech,1
i had a recent fall at work and because i trained myself how to fall off a bike safely i only had minor bruising on my butt i did a tuck and roll like when i fall off the bike great advise alex and ollie,2
when i got right hooked a few years ago i only had time to think this is gonna suck and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement fortunately i came away with only bruises and road rash nothing got broken and i think in part it was because i didn t have a chance to put my hands out also glad i was wearing a helmet,2
i still have my copy of eddie borysewiczs bicycle road racing in it he discusses practicing tumbling and diving somersaults in a gym to improve your crash response unfortunately i havent practiced that but my last inelegant dismount was at low speed so only some skin lost,1
askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i managed to puncture my tyre the other day sealant didn t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs even tried a patch inside the tyre the puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been mm large given the tire had plenty of life left i am gutted that i may have to discard the tire now when would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is ko,0
askgcntech riding in a strong crosswind the other day i wondered if a high cadence would give a gyroscope effect and reduce buffeting from the wind presumably from feet and shoes if so can ollie show us the maths please,1
my last crash yrs ago i was on the ground so fast i had no time to react or prepare for the impact but the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool,2
another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim water is incompressible unlike air so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact,0
askgcntech as a heavier rider i feel i m always in the max range of gears either hardest gear on flat sh roads or my easiest gear when i see any sustained gradients i currently run a compact chain set with a cassette on the rear would i benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear,0
i bought an old tractor to help clear the land i was building on stick with me i was towing a large log when i felt the back of my leg getting wet no problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires tyres apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres tires with water to improve traction due to the added weight maybe sealant would be a better idea expensive though love the show guys,2
mkbhds dad what do we gift him hes a tech blogger he has every freaking piece of tech mkbhds mom lets get him a water bottle,1
intro backpack inch macbook prom max sd card reader airpods max airtags body cap for canon r webcam canon r cables power adapter w realme power adapter apple watch charger pens adapter wallet iphone pro pixel pro bye,1
having shot canon for years i switched the nikon in love both brands but prefered the nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the canon methodology of the buttons on the top plate r really improved that but i love the isoless nature of the nikon sensors canon is getting better in that regard but still behind nikon and sony,2
hey marques i know these sound insignificant but since you rarely update your little donglesaccessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens i think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what youd like to see changedsimplified with those work flows just an idea,2
mkbhd im a photographer and use the peak edc v im impressed you got a into the l im sure its a snug fit and doesnt leave alot of room for a ipad too wanted to give you a little tip i found on that bag here goes the main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones airpods etc go you just have to fish a cable through the corner i do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable it makes it so i can leave a pass through usb travel battery charger with folding prongs that means i plug in all my devices when theyre in the zip area laptop phone tablet and airpods and they all get charge from the battery and when i get to the hotel late i just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and i hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place not only that when theyre done charging the battery starts charging i wake up with everything ready to go hope you enjoy trying this out,2
would love to see an edcdaily tech for everyone else in the studio,2
marquess reaction was genuine here he was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next,2
i went to check out the opal camera because i need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit i loved everything i saw on the site up until the point of the month fee to use their software on a webcam i think ill just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a logi webcam instead other than that nice tech kit also yeah your experience with the pixel mirrors my past experience with pixel phones i got one to try something different to the iphone and i loved it for a few months i tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldnt or it would reboot in the middle of doing something,2
you are carrying great tech and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on apple their ecosystem is really good i am an android user and dont stick to just one brand but my wife is allapple and she really likes how seemless everything is cool stuff marques,2
hey marques can you do an updated the ecosystem explained i think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for apple side of the ecosystem but also android seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for androids love all your videos btw,2
i can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future its a marvelous piece of tech thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come,2
the exoskeleton probably wouldn t be affordable for everyone to use and may have long term effects but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use,2
ive got that azeron keypad highly recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal but especially for gaming highly highly you can even find certain models on amazon usually i ordered mine from the factory for the color scheme and one of the newer designs the one on this video is the original design which im sure is still just as phenomenal but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem,2
the game pad that you highlighted actually is already available i am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it s over us and you would still need a mouse also i have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an xbox controller for my pc so i decided it wasn t worth it but it s still a very good design in my opinion and i would love to see how it feels to use irl just not at that price point lol,2
cyborg game controller looks pretty neat i am from from latvia and that company makes pretty high end gaming gear expensive too,2
can you imagine being able to one day look out a window and determine what the weather is like the future truly is here,1
i will forever appreciate this channel youve helped me and my family a lot your videos advice lessons and funny words are inspirational and helpful to us my husband and i have been able to minimal conscious in spending saving and investing wisely i now earn every week youre such a blessing to this generation we all love you,2
wow imagine having the ability to determine the weather simply by looking out the window what a world we are living in,1
man to think one day i might be able to own a dehumidifier and a battery wow,2
yes the game pad is incredibly convenient but incredibly expensive so seemingly lower quality production than its competitors that being said i would sure love to have one,2
when someone tells a lie deep down they know this is wrong they have no compassion,0
when you as an employee are fired from a company and the reasons they are giving you are poor performance or lack of culture fit trust me when i tell you the real reasons are not disclosed been there done that companies lie hr works for the company and also lies and a corporation hierarchy matters when you lawyer up is when they start taking you a bit more seriously,0
great daily blog you all do a great job picking the most relevant daily headline to cover such a high level discussion in such a short clip i watch or listen every day,2
the market cycle still hasnt met its balance we keep going round in circles while waiting for that huge blow out on a huge support but in the mean time we could always ignore the market ups and downs and stay fully invested big thanks to lily alice for helping me earn over btc by implementing her method and following her guide,2
all the musk haters who said he was doing this for laughs are salty rn,0
thank you for this report well done and very helpful,2
most tech companies let things like this slide all the time,0
karma hit twitter hard,0
zoe could be replaced by siri and these videos would be exactly the same,1
when it comes to a person journalist slander up and down when it s a company you say they are allegations,0
fun fact even though the employees get for an upgrade it usually does not cover the cost of the things linus breaks,1
once you spend to grand on magic cards you kinda don t wanna pay for them anymore really hits home for me,0
its almost impressive how many ltt employees even with a k upgrade have the jankiest setups i have ever seen,2
just a note on the screw driver put some extended bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it its very common for some screws to be deep in a hole and having those small bits into hex end wont go in far enough down the hole to extract screw i see this allot on laptops controllers that kinda thing sunk in screws suck,0
at this point i think that the whole point of labs was to fill it with more employees so that we never run out of intel tech upgrades i will buy as many screwdrivers as it takes to pay their salaries plz just give me more intel extreme tech upgrades,1
ltt extreme tech upgrades will never not be absolutely funny and somewhat informative,2
i think one of the things i love the most about these intel extreme upgrades is linus learning and getting angry at his employees for everything about their lives,2
this episode has me cracking up hard love the rabbit hole that nick has gone down with the keyboard mods respect,2
i love how even linus doesnt want to fit all those hard drives in in a such a jank way im with you linus ill do a lot to make things easier but thats a bit too far xd,2
i love his space its messy full of things that he could throw away if he really went through it all but its a catalog of and container for life as hes living it rather than just a show piece,2
after seeing the macro pad i was checking out their website and loved all their products ive wanted a product like this for when i stream to make it easier and this here is just what i need its a great product and id love it for my setup,2
very surprised with this months list considering how every single item in the list feels like it could go with my setup or just seems super cool to me usually theres one or two items that i dont think id personally find useful but i am adding all these items to my wishlist,2
i absolutely loved the hoto laser measuring tool as an engineering student i am constantly measuring objects and like using various rulers i would love to own one of these hoto laser measuring tools for sure also this months list particularly caught my eye as everything listed seems like something i would want to purchase in the near future,2
so many great products on this list these are all incredibly practical too especially the macropad the abililty to customize literally every aspect of it is killer,2
the hoto laser was a pretty good change of pace loved it feels very complementary to the theme of office gadgets keep em coming ideas specific underdesk drawers and other more furniture alike stuff that will make your setup noice,2
timestamps hoto laser measuring tool axis fanlight mechanical pc switch pikatea r macropad biometric drawer lock,1
just discovered your channel and the series going to be watching your older ones today while working that macro pad is really cool that would definitely be something id pick up and use,2
that macropad looks killer been looking for a segue into custom keyboards for a while and that seems like a great place to start looks like it would be incredibly useful for both work and personal applications too which is a huge plus would love to have one in the near future,2
i ve actually been looking for macro pads recently and you just upload the very thing i needed i love that you can customize it to fit your aesthetic truly a must have for any setup,2
that macropad looks so love the customisation of it all,2
yooo long time no see just so youre updated ive spent the last week in north carolina and ive filmed no less than big videos that are all dropping this july for more tech fails,1
arun this product killed over a hundred people also arun out of,0
arun this product destroyed the entirety of earth also arun out of fail,0
man i seriously love this series and the fact that you buy these failed products steps thing up a notch,2
great to see you including a wider variety of stuff in these videos beyond just electronic devices especially the pharmaceutical industry if youre going to include banned medications then the top of the list in your next video should be thalidomide what it did was absolutely tragic it was banned decades ago yet people are still suffering and living with severe disabilities to this day thousands of families destroyed and lives lost too,0
this is such a good video arun the amount of research locations and editing that this video needed is enormous thank you for doing this,2
arun looks so fit now im glad to see him taking care of himself too,2
there was also another problem with the fitbit when some of the straps would irritate your skin and leave a rash and still the company hasnt dealt with it yet,0
this is a common misconception while part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner this would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that edit normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine and would never cause issues but they made the battery too thin meaning it shorted it out easier just wanted to clarify that,0
i now know i like this guy i at first thought i had some type of prejudicial dislike of him maybe because he was too smooth and that goes against my grain but i love this guy because he does seem to care about things and many of them seem not to be regarding how much money he can make off of a ad for a person it seems as his reviews are sincere and these seem not to have to do with what ive seen only from him which is technology i really love the fact that this guy cares about peoples safety and he brings up some safety issues which people should be concerned about if they have children especially with the toys and the baby monitors yeah this guy is getting a big a from me,2
im hoping this video will blow you away so much work has gone into it and so many people have been fed because of it to check out the tiniest tech,2
arun ok now it s time for the mouse pad also arun pulls out a yoga mat,1
yes you definitely need to fill the lighter with fluid they are shipped empty for safety reasons the smoke you were getting was because you were burning up the dry wick,1
i really appreciate this shaq episode and the effort that went into making it normal looking things scaled up seems much like mrbeast kinda thing think u got inspired by him i have seen the giant toblerone before in sorted the incredible cooking channel has shown the chocolate bar in their occasion based pretentious product series it cost may be poundsbut what u showed is probably bigger than sorted oneits actually cool and it is my favourite chocolate bar too,2
those earbuds are actually pretty cool decorate it somewhere good and it d act like good speakers,2
i actually have a mousemat that came with my desk thats larger than the one you have its specifically designed to cover the entire surface of the inch desk since its a desk built for gaming,2
him we re gonna spend k on giant tech products in the next mins also him buys a kg chocolate bar,1
wow i never seen technology that big before,2
little did he know there was lots of those keyboards on amazon that he could of got insted of doing that lol,1
i have so much respect for you feeding the homeless with the cake,2
if gaiman decides to start a youtube channel to talk about myths and history i would definitely watch that,2
neil gaiman could read me my groceries list and i would still feel like hes reading us a story for the ages,1
i know this isnt entirely uncommon with authors but ive always loved how much neil gaiman feels like a neil gaiman character,2
you know it s gonna be great when he says unless it s a furry minotaur and then specified that this is going to be great,2
he seems like the younger nerdier slightly crazy brother of alan rickman,1
its nice to see mr gaiman talk about death as being kind his friend and occasional coauthor terry pratchett wrote about death in the same way,2
i love hearing neil speak and explain things he s such a character,2
i have been in love with mr gaiman for decades and i couldnt click on this video fast enough major thanks to wired for this video and major thanks to mr gaiman for doing this for all us fans who cant get enough of him,2
i want neil gaiman rick riordan and stephen fry all in one room discussing myths and mythology that would be a colab of a century for me,1
i love how he sings his words ragnarok essennntially beginnnnnnns with everything going wrong,2
you can tell hes serious about his craft but not obnoxious about it the best you can hope for,2
hes really respectful of people enjoying sushi differently class act,2
nothing should look sad it should look bright good to know when the aliens come down looking for human sashimi they wont be coming after me,2
you can tell he smiles all the time he just has a happy atmosphere,2
i love how positive this guy is never says a bad word about anyone made me feel like im not stupid even when hes dispelling my wildly inaccurate preconceptions,2
i met a sushi chef back in who had been living in the usa for thirty years at the time he claimed to be the inventor of california roll he said he developed it to warm customers to the concept of sushi sort of a beginner s sushi,1
as long as people understand that this is not traditional chefs have the creative freedom to do whatever they want pitty so many prefer to gatekeep stuff and belittle others who merely do things differently respect to taka sakaeda what a lovely person,2
a friend of mine chastised me for eating sushi with my hands saying its not finger food it was nice to hear the chef say the literal opposite of that,1
sushi chef is answering the real questions,1
i am so glad i got to see a sushi chef refer to sushi as finger food i am tired of the snobs looking at me weird every time i decide to just pick up a piece and eat it,2
really appreciate you taking the time and effort of putting it out there look forward to watching more of your great content in the past two years assets like gold nasdaq and sp have all lagged behind the usd monetary inflation rate m money supply is up while bitcoin has appreciated during the same period my stock portfolio over the last years is massively down against my bitcoin using thomas fuller strategy in my view bitcoin has been one of the best holds during this uncertain market my bitcoin portfolio have been on a rise although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits i still have about btc worth of crypto assets i can take a drop down to k and still be doing better than my stock portfolio ive stopped buying most stocks im dcaing into bitcoin and im hoarding cash that will go entirely into bitcoin if theres another good drop,2

whats the best way to make money from crypto investing,1
my financial goal is to be making at least up to every year by investing heavily both in crypto and stock i need guidiance please comment below,1
can definitely vouch for the switch grip i used to never play handheld mode because of how uncomfortable it was now i do it all the time with the grip,2
dude that battery swap alone would sell me over the sony h steelseries hit it hard with that feature i wish more peripherals had that ability,2
its a great month for tech with a lot of cool and reliable products love em all,2
i gotta admit that steelseries headset is next level also the switch grip being under is a steal,2
the oivo grip is amazing have one for my v switch as well,2
the music in the background is just a classic for this channel love it,2
grover also lets you buy products if you keep renting every month until it reaches retail price realy like that laptop keep renting until it youve paid the equivalent of retail and its yours easy payment plan type vibes,1
yes for your sponsor grover if you keep renting a product until you reach its retail price you can keep it forever for a symbolic dollar or if you fall in love with an item before that you can also pay it off at any point so the only issue i find with that is why must we have to pay retail for a refurbished or used item,1
best part about the novas is being able to use the switch with it since it has bt i go from pc play some ps then go off the grid with the switch all on one headset it s amazing,2
when we moved to home working i got the logitech mx master it s been great as an all round mouse i miss my setup when i have to go back i to the office lol although i could just take my mouse with me,2
i love this series the experts are not judgemental and very professional,2
for those who are curious not only is it widely accepted that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs but we also know exactly where the asteroid landed its called the chicxulub crater its located on the northern coast of the yucatan peninsula and has been carbondated to have formed in that time period and it size of the crater certainly looks catastrophic enough,0
such innocence when he reads godstiddies he is adorable,2
i would absolutely love to attend a paleontology course that guy was running his enthusiasm is infectious,2
the way he factually states the world is a sphere makes you feel like hes heard even weirder statements before and this is just another misconception he corrects,0
since when were pterodactyls not dinosaurs since ever that is probably one of the greatest answers,2
hearing this guy stay professional while reading the username godstiddies was the highlight of my day,2
that was cool i like that he said jurassic park was for entertainment not science i often hear people complaining that things like jurassic park arent scientifically accurate who cares i watch that kind of stuff to be entertained if i want to learn something ill watch a documentary which i also do,2
the fact that birds are technically dinosaurs is a fact that would have blown my mind as a kid which is why i try to bring it up with kids as often as i can growing up plesiosaurus was my favorite dinosaur although it s technically not a dinosaur my other favorites are maiasaura and parasaurolophus,2
you can always tell when someone enjoys their job he is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about dinosaurs what a great series,2
the biggest problem is colleges charging outrages tuition fees causing this to happen,0
so everyone who couldn t afford college will have to pay for those who did why not make college affordable in the first place,0
now we need to cap these institutions no more predatory pricing honestly these collegesuniversities should be paying back people the interest as well those who have and have not paid off their loans last years included,0
today i learned low income families make up to k per year,1
regulate college tuition so that this doesn t happen again please otherwise this will be pointless,0
my question is if you are in public service for the years is the qualifying payments still a requirement under this new announcement,1
when colleges knew about this watch them charge more tuition then you will know why college is expensive in the first place,0
he needs to find a way to get schools to lower their tuition rates and quit trying to game a broken student loan system this will just keep happening and its not going to stop idealistic young people from taking out massive debt on a useless degree the schools need to be regulated if they take govt funds then they should be subject to immediate regulation,0
the states deregulated tuition and fees so the colleges could charge more then they used that money to hire more administrators and build more buildings the students are not just paying for their education they are also paying for all the things the colleges wanted but the states did not want to give them money for nobody talks about that,0
there is no such thing as loan cancellation its merely a transfer do people not understand how this works,0
click here for the latest news on the midterm elections,1
im trying to hold onto hope and positivity for new york state but every year it gets harder and harder,0
nadler shouldnt be allowed to drive much less wield power,0
this is a good way to get rid of career politicians from one party by putting them both in the against each other meaning one of them will be gone at least,1
funny how democrats always choose the old white man lol,0
a population of mass psychosis,0
nyof course dems did well,2
it never matter how win the question is is the state is any better under either politicians all politicians are very corrupt,0
what is charlie republican democrat independent conservative liberal socialist he has been them all,1
ny democrats never cease to amaze me picking the absolute worst representatives possible thanks jim eagle,0
i feel for civilians that just want to live a peaceful normal life in ukraine,0
to be clear its not alleged war crimes they have tried and convicted people for them already so yes war crimes are being committed in ukraine just because you dont like saying it doesnt change that its actually happening to the people it affects,0
i whole heartedly agree with the guy from nato who was saying that europe and the us will pay a high price this winter for supporting ukraine this winter but not supporting them will cost us even more the biggest threat to ukraine right now is that the rest of us will lose interest and abandon them ukraine needs to get all their territory back or russia is just going to eat them in bites and then they will move to the next nation that they want to add back to the soviet union,0
happy independence day to ukraine and glory the reason why i support ukraine because i m human and i support human rights and if ukraine surrenders there will be no more ukraine and it won t save lives it will only end up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin and mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to destroy ukraine as a nation just like rome destroyed carthage russians don t treat ukrainians as people,0
he thought it would take him days to take over all of ukraine its been months and he barely took a small part of the east and south and even there ukraine from time to time take some sections back ukraine deserves most of the credit they have proven themselves not just brave and tenacious but also skilled capable the west deserves the rest of the credit putin actually managed to unite us,1
putin is the greatest gift to nato since the end of the cold war now thats funny,2
happy independence day ukrainian people,2
what an excellent piece very good questions and thoughtful answers definitive predictions of course not events in war are hard to predict thank you for a very useful piece,2
thank you very much for your analytical comments and predictions on the war in the ucraine as such more vital weapons supply nato expanding with finland and sweden to face putins war agression and threats and moral worldwide support growing for a democratic and free ucraine as it can daily be seen,2
something important to know for all who are interested in history andor support ukraine rus ought not to be confused with russia which derives its name from the rus but historically is a completely different state which almost all its existence was at war with the rus just like the holy roman empire was actually germany russia is actually muscovy despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise its name russia received only in when peter i passed a decree to change tsardom of muscovy s name into the russian empire russia originates from rosia name used by the greek orthodox clergy in regards to kyivan rus under the reign of cathrine ii muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as muscovites and were forced to call themselves russian lands that russia claims were part of the original rus but actually werent are novgorod suzdal and ryazan since in historical texts of xixii centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from rus they can be considered parts of extended rus although their culture was distinct from main rus in moscow prince ivan iii appointed himself to be the great ruler of all rus no other kings acknowledged that from that point on muscovy started to make false claims on rus ownership russia is an offshoot of ukraine and not the other way round despite what soviet and russian historians have been trying to say for years kiev was a developed cultured capital when moscow was just another swamp village germany used to call itself the holy roman empire that didn t mean they became the romans and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of italy and its history but yet that s exactly what russia did in regards to rus ukraine which is a horrible injustice,1
do you remember what happens when we give unaccounted money and weapons to countries to fight proxy wars we keep making the same mistakes over and over,0
victory is assured if we receive this time,2
notice how the guy calling in keeps saying we in regards to ukraine weird,0
the end of the cold war brought an end to many of the proxy wars through which the two sides struggled to exert their influence,1
glory to our knights in shining armour the sword and shield of democracy ukraine,2
our government should be held accountable for the pointless expense on this war they already have genocidal turkey helping them and they will still lose at the end all this money could have gone to peoplegovernment took months with vacations to send us measly dimes during covidbut billions they send at a whim,0
armenia could have used that aid to fight against azerbaijan during the karabakh war,1
interesting news since russia is advancing on every front right now even ukraines own map shows that sure wish these experts would actually tell the news for once,1
i hate to say it but i don t think the ukrainians are going to be able to counter attack remember ukraine uses artillery shells a day russia on the other hand is using shells a day russia has the most tanks in world there isn t a shortage of there wasn t a shortage then how come luhansk has fallen let s not get ahold of ourselves,0
saddakur incoming when he can t deliver the sheer overconfidence they project as underdogs is off putting not in touch with reality,0
russia is being beaten at highspeed attrition warfare it is alarming how russia is throwing away its best lives and equipment victory to ukraine,0
always remember this you cant operate an army without supply trucks also fuel trucks destroy or capture all russian trucks are they armored no do they have heavy weapons on them no is a army truck driver a high skilled soldier no puncture truck tires or damage the engines,0
happy independence day ukrainians,2
to be good at something you got to be doing it all the time why do you think the americans are so good at war,0
the world needs to help congo government financially to save second last rain forest from being mined,1
as a former combat planner in vietnam i agree with general hodges putins attrition strategy is not well thought out firstly they dont have the right equipment manpower or time ukraine has all of that except for equipment in sufficient quantities over time the wests resources will help ukraine fill that gap,0
a decisive battle between civilization and savagery has begun even in the second world war it was not like that because the two savages were on different sides of the front it was an intergerman showdown the germanoslavic ethnic of the deutschs against the germanoceltic french and the english and the russian savagery was either together with the savagery of the deutschs or against them now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery i see the philosophical law of contradiction civilization is definitely a positive phenomenon but it is mixed with negativity in the form of shame and cowardice civilization has hid behind ukraine and is waiting for something unknown the memory of civilizations victory in this war will be tainted with the memory of shame,1
europe is forever in debt for the bravery of ukraine hopefully russia shall pay to rebuild ukraina slava,0
i wonder how many soldiers are now joining the resistance,1

i feel like i m in a simulation at this point,0
national archives are meant for historical purposes to be referred to for future generations any president that thinks that they can hold on to documents needs to have the respect of that policy,1
even though trump can barely read putin sure can and has read every page trump handed him,1
i got seconds in and already call bullsht i paused the video to comment but started reading other comments i was amazed because every comment shows disdain for our media including cbs news smh caused me to forget my original and now meaningless thought,0
i am so ready for the future together in faith expose the documents,2
there was a care and custody record for all of the top secret documents i want to know when each and every single one of them was taken from wherever they were taken from but some taking on january th but im taking on january rd or some taking on january th when were they taken,1
did fbi agents also seize xerographic copies of top secret documents from the maralago abode,1
is he just hiding documents in doughnut boxes im so confused,0
being a politician should not be a career choice term limits for everyone,0
seeing young kids behind him cheering is just insane,2
term limit is desperately needed for both the house and the senate,1
term limits is a must tired of these crooked cryptic politicians retire,0
the voters get what they deserve,1
i love how new yorkers put pride over common sense as if there were anything to be proud of they deserve exactly all the things are going through,2
wow you would think new yorkers would learn incredible,2
whats shocking is how many people like this guy pretty disgusting,0
hes more detached from the people he represents then any representative in us history,0
are they really that hard up for candidates in new york,1
i knew he was saving this for the midterms,1
biden covid isn t an emergency open the border also biden the covid emergency is going on so we must forgive student loans,1
all of this does nothing to correct the problem of high college tuition schools will continue to leverage off government loans and at the same time increase tuition to pay for their exorbitant pensions the cycle continues,0
i like the part where he said the dept of education will no longer allow predatory loans so this doesnt happen again,1
i didnt realize up to k per family is consider low income people making way less than that will be paying for his forgiveness plan this administration is insane,0
everyone knows money doesnt mean anything anymore unless you have some the govt can take,0
i ll believe it when i see my credit report,2
can we do more to make college cheaper rather than give away government money to bloated universities,1
yes perfect i took out loans just in case he would cancel i could have paid for school but i invested it instead best decision,2
brilliant analysis of the different things to watch for on the different time frames good to see everyone feels the same way when they lose money everyone thinks they could do this or that with that money which is as good as gone instead people refuse to seek help from professionals edward joseph james set to be different and unique i made about k already from his day tradng all i did was to copy his daily signals am done having heart breaks hodling and trading myself lol,1
as far as the weather this is absolutely crazy what is going on my deepest thoughts and prayers are with everyone across the globe who is in a danger zone and experiencing such hardships,0
thoughts and prayers to all of usa in waters stay safe from the typhoon belt in the pacific las islas filipinas,2
i dont care how many cops there they are not going in to protect ussoooo sad,0
it s either floods droughts or wildfires actually it s all of them simultaneously years from now we might actually start to think seriously about reducing emissions but i doubt it,0
thank you nbc more americans get their news now from nbc then any other source believe that,2
love the pilots to the rescue story great job folks,2
vermont is getting rain and thunder right now at pmburlington vt,1
we need to focus in planting trillions of trees if we want to survive as a specie we need more trees more agriculture more technology and mainly love and peace amount us you have to plant a tree dont wait for the goverment make sure you plant one,1
the reaction from the host is priceless dont agree with some of these opinions,1
its time we spend money on where it worths build a system that can direct flood water to drought areas eg california las vegas or at least can store the water,1
and if loans forgiven it has to include and reimburse those who ve already paid their loans emperor nero,1
biden how much do you think we need to give them to secure their vote but leave some left over for future elections answer k,1
which means the taxpayers will have to foot the bill,0
didnt obama say never underestimate joes ability to well you know the thing,1
going to be a lot of people upset when they realize what this does to the economy,0
biden hey i can help you lose pounds in second without exercise take out machete and cuts right arm off biden there you re welcome dont forget to vote for me in november,2
so people who paid their debt off just as people who immigrated to usa legally are slapped in the face by people who cannot or will not pay their debt,0
i knew he would do this just ahead of midterms,1
forgiveness means the debt goes away never to be seen nor heard of again this is robbing peter to pay paul,0
this administration is starting to remind me of a time in history called the taxation without representation taxes taxes taxes biden and harris,0
i like presidents who dont try to steal classified nuclear documents,1
thats so weird hes been screaming he wanted transparency the whole time and now he doesnt want anybody to look at the documents he stole,0
first the documents weren t there then the documents were planted and now he wants to ban them what a joke,0
simple as this these documents do not belong to him and never did demanding they be returned when they shouldn t have been in his home in the first place is ludicrous,0
how fast can the judge say motion denied,1
trumps a modern day obstructionist especially about things and issues that can convict him,0
trump files motion judge falls out of chair laughing,1
so first he never had it then the cult cried planted documents now he did have it but thinks it s his you can t make this stuff upindict indict indict and indict,0
this video is not for children its shocking alltimeml mr dunn respect to you,0
one asinine move after another from the trump team concerning the searchandseizure i guess trump didnt get the memo that he no longer has enablers in congress or at the doj to bail him out,0
how can reporting on this be so bad the president has the authority to declassified documents not a single one of those documents is classified do better,0
only trump would call a search warrant unwarranted,0
i love how they let swalwell speak on this situation whenever he was sleeping with a chinese spy,1
we are learning how many documents were allegedly took lol does anyone but me understand that past presidents have clearance for classified material and are briefed on a regular basis,1
these people spending all this time and money to try to find dirt on trump is getting old,0
allegedly they say this to avoid being sued learn how words work,0
if he was up to something he would have declassified them when he had the power this is as stupid as the ones getting tickled about this raid,0
they really just dont want him to rerun for presidencyhes not in the club,0
according to your video title the fbi took trumps property,1
here s one for ya if they were so important and they did know about this since he left office why wait years to get the warrant especially in an election year mind blown stop being sheep,0
cosatu is trying to manipulate the people of south africacyril said before the prices rosehe said he discussed that with stake holders and labour unionswhy cosatu and saftu are marching now does this means they are not satisfied with the cost of living or they want to see how many south africans reacts,0
shluggishness to start the protest that could be a problem in our work environment as well lets try to be more in time for work and work with greater vigour to make this a nicer country to live in,0
if they were marching for change of government i could have joined on this one even the so called ministers and or aspiring have joined they can march trillion times a day no feedback,1

did trump say he was going to be the law and order president maybe we misunderstood him he meant the lawsuit president,1
our legal system is broken loopholes exist that allow the wealthy to avoid the sort of jail time that would have been inflicted on someone who cant afford elite lawyer representation i get sick of it but im not sure what a challenge to the status quo would look like,0
there is definitely more to this story like in june the lawyer signed a document saying that was the last of the documents as well,1
how long will we allow this clown to continue thses charade its embarrassing to the nation and democracy no one else would even come close to being tolerated,0
it is impossible to simply walk off with these documents and keep them in order to do that you have to purposely want to take them away i cant understand it mick mulvaney,0
wait but it was his fans that wanted them unveiled,1
first he wanted it out now he don t so typical of him,0
he better get more than a slap on the wrist,1
our greatest concern is that biden remains in office for another five minutes,0
we defeated the wrong enemy now they are destroying us from within,0
if you still vote for brandon after all this you re beyond trying to reason with,0
i can see how much respect the prime minister has for the fjb administration hes right this is madness,1
we are very confident biden will look into the situation as soon as he gets back from vacation,2
it is a shame that ben has to go behind joe and clean up his terrible policies,0
do people remember when joe the big guy told americans get ready for a dark winter itll be like youve never seen,1
if you say this is the worst choice you can imagine its guaranteed that thats exactly what this administration will do,0
leave them alone i absolutely agree another example of the federal government f ing things up,0
if its a dangerous threat to americans and a bad deal you can be sure biden will agree to it,0
yes the airlines should pay for hotels food transportation from and to airports full refunds they make billions on all if us and we get to sleep in the airports floors yes make them all responsible for their mess ups,0

very glad awp was requested to come help jared and doug are a registered charity and rely on donations and support to help families for free they take their efforts very seriously now after two years and solved cases they offer training to local police expanded to two teams with a dive master and training ozark adventures to create a third hope they stay safe and their dedication pays off to provide answers to the family,2
my strength is with the family of the missing teen,1
there s no way to enter a serial number and search for the owner how are we ever supposed to stop gun violence with a stupid law like that,0
i was just one of the persons that asked for adventures with purpose to come in and help i have watched this team for a long while now they are the very best i wish them safety and hope im praying this young lady is found soon best of luck to these men if she is in the water they will find her,2
sorry for the year old my child at yrs could not be out partying at midnight no way no how hate me now love me later,0
just knowing that first responders took pictures and shared them with friends would cause me major distress just because they werent on social media doesnt mean the public didnt see them i hope she wins big and they are forced into reprimanding the staff along with making policy changes,0
kudos to the ukrainian freedom orchestraits quite refreshing to see this side of ukraine continue to fight with your instruments for your culturewe do appreciate every one of you stay strong,2
if you are watching this i wish you the best with everything that you do i wish you the best with everything you go through,2
the market has been pretty bad until today it decided to surge everybody was practically crying then it kept dipping thats what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own big thank to hilder ferguson im not bothered with how bad the market is because my assests are insured due to her advice and i still receive my profits,0
not only on the wrong track but off the rails chuck,0
conveniently leaving out voters opinions on the media by far the worst of the institutions,0
why would they be angry they voted for it,0
if you read barbara walters how civil wars start you would know that there are two issues that lead to violence anocracy and factionalization democracies dont fight nor do authoritarian states its the transition from one system to the other where the hazards are found thats anoncracy factions in the book means when people sort themselves by ethnic or sectarian attributes rather than policy preferences and this sorting creeps into their entire lives weve been on that course since the tea party started the only cure is doubling down on democratic participation the gop is pointedly not doing that anywhere theyve got their hands on the controls we are being steered right for the ditch so im glad at least one in five of us say thats the problem we face,0
wage slavery during the apocalypse polls poorly who would have guessed,0

this gives hope to all malaysian citizensjustice is prevail,2
hopefully after thisour judiciary system will always be free from corrupt politicians,1
what a victory for malaysians much thanks to the judiciary that refuse to take nonsense to delay and frustrate pms are not fallible and you can t get away with crimes as such that also goes to show that politicians are not invincible and must be accountable for their actions tahniah,1
semoga malaysia semakin berjaya from indonesia,1
rekod die buat perdana menteri pertama yang dijatuhkan melalui pilihan raya perdana menteri pertama ke penjara,1

peribahasa orang tamak selalu rugi tu benar apa lagi yang tak cukup dengan jawatan dan gaji yang besar sebagai perdana menteri apa yang kurang dalam kehidupan seorang perdana menteri lebih menyedihkan seorang muslim beragama islam seorang pemimpin yg sepatutnya jadi teladan tapi berkelakuan sebaliknya semalam beliau buat sumpah laknat hari ni beliau ke penjara sedangkan semua bukti telah ditunjukkan di mahkamah bahawa ternyata beliau melakukan kesalahan beliau masih berani bersumpah dengan nama allah begitu mudah ucap dan permainkan nama allah serta agamanya cukup ada seorang penyangak najib di malaysia ni jangan kita benarkan dan lahirkan lebih ramai penyangak seperti najib di masa akan datang jangan jadikan malaysia kotor dan jijik di pndangan negara dunia lain,1

it s really unfortunate that the intended target was missed,0
my heartfelt condolences to the car,1
rip to the toyota lancruiser also killed in the bombing it would have reach a retiring million km mark with proper motor oil transmission oil and gear cases maintenance it will be missed by the local dealership mechanic,0
i feel so bad for the victim of that bombing my heart goes out to the car,0
sucks to suck dugin unfortunate a car was destroyed in the process,0
ukrainians express their deepest condolences to the vehicle she was in,1
slava ukraini i really hope that mr dugin knows what the pain is when losing your shared ones like all the parents in ukraine who lost daughters sons babiesmom and dad during that sad war,0
the ignorance of the people vilifying someone who tragically was assassinated is asinine also doesnt help when you realize that russia is using her death as a franz ferdinand moment so yeah keep vilifying til your world ends not a threat an analyzation with this russia wont stop til ukraine falls,0
i m dead serious about this he switched cars at the last second now why would he do that felt his safety was in danger something doesn t add up about all this,0
i feel bad for the daughter not for the father,0
the case was brought to federal court only to have another year of freedom his side clearly had no proper counter arguments from the start pity the court of having to deal with this drama,0
my salute to the judges they are not swayed by threats accusations against them justice is served,2
this is the real meaning of merdekafor rakyat,2
imagine a prime minister this corrupted can you think of the people in his circle,0
fair and transparent trial and appeal despite vile attempts to delay and frustrate justice,0
the best day of my life the best news ever whatever goes around comes around justice prevailed thank god,2
there is hope for our nation thank you to the prosecution and judiacry,2
this year merdeka is probably one of the most memorable ones after najibs final verdict the judges are our last straw of hope to bring corruptors behind the bars,2
the court had done its job now the rakyats turn if bn wins the next pru itll likely be that they ask for royal pardon to free him itll be difficult to know if agong will grant it seeing this is a serious crime of trustworthiness and integrity we do not know its our job to make sure bn has no such opportunity,0
finally justice has been served to najib razak,1
thank god for the people who called it in and the officers who responded,2
whoever saw him and said something saved untold innocent lives,1
great job to everyone that was aware and made a call to action you helped save lives unfortunately this is becoming the normal but if we are alert and step in we can avoid a tragedy,2
shows what a tremendous difference we can make by being alert and notifying the authorities when suspicious better to be safe than sorry the police aren t able to do this on their own without us all being aware and responsible citizens massive thank you to all those involved especially those who did chose to speak up,2
i m grateful that someone was paying attention and called it in and everyone is safe i m sad for the young lady though who feels like it was the only place she could go to feel accepted i hope she can find some peace and friendship in a more permanent way,2
bless the witnesses who reported this and the police who responded we should all take note and keep our eyes out to protect each other,1
my friends were there last night fucking props to those that called it in,0
excellent job to the grant county sheriffs office and to the people attending the concert who kept an eye out and reported it,2
thank god that someone was observant and took action to prevent another mass shooting,1
this is terrifying a couple days ago i was just talking to my friend who went to a music festival where the security didnt even check bags she was kinda scared how an event like that could easily be the target of mass shooting,0

lester you are the only news i listen to these days it is such a relief to have one outlet to hear the current news reported in a neutral factual way everywhere else there is no reporting just drama and opinions about current events thank you thank you thank you,2
in a heartbeat ill vote for her,2
interesting news coverage and very informative definitely things to know about,2
cdc couldve responded whatever way they wanted but as we all saw during the pandemic too many people would have simply not cared heck it was too much for them to even wear a mask,0
what a great story by a honorable and honest man i believe himand am also someone who has had contact much love and peace to all,2
didn t need the cdc to make that announcement we knew they didn t do their job,0
a country is not great until it can protect all its people with free healthcare is pence feeling the heat getting closer sorry about cheney wyoming got its priority really wrong,0

this is how we ukrainians feel when your missiles fly over us all the time watching our fellow friends and family die at your hands,0
it was a beautiful car explosion a perfect car explosion people tell me theyve never seen such as perfect car explosion,2
someone wanted to take him out but ended up hurting him one million times more,0
it hurt ha now the father can feel the pain he likes to influenced,0
he has lost what is most precious to himself his no claims bonus,0
well he now knows how the families of the victims of the novichok attack feel in britain,0
he ll probably blame everyone else but himself after immersing himself in hatred he will probably be genuinely perplexed as to why anybody might want to kill them,0
instant karma feel the pain of many ukrainian fathers who have lost their sons and daughters in ukraine this is much painful than being assassinated,0
the fear he and others with him will suffer every time he gets into a car now,0
its tragic that someone loses their life like that but dont forget that one violence is the cause of another violence the young womans father propagated violence and now it came back to him with violence against his family use your brain violence is always the worst option,0
prayers that everyone in their family get to dry ground and stay safe but also this is a blessing so many of these areas really needed this water,2
hope the person missing in zion national park is found safehopefully they were able to get to higher ground,2
itll never hit home till it actually hits home for some people,0
the rain is greatly needed in some areas but i want folks to be safe also,2
the potential tropical storm passed thru here in merida yucatan a couple days ago was pretty fierce our strongest storm of the rainy season definitely needed to place objects that can become airborne in a safe place hopefully monterrey will get the much needed rains theyve been praying for,2
wowat same time i had flooding inside my house in caribbean pushing flood water out my mind went on gratitude that others have it worse not knowing same occuring simultaneously i hope all recover quickly,0
when the land is hit by heat waves and dries water usually cant get in and thats a recipe for floods when it rains,0
maybe we could build more water reservoirs on a smaller scale to gather this much needed water just an idea,1
this is what happens when we continue to neglect the environment when our lakes are drying up the only way to stop future tragedies like this is to get on top of our climate issues,0
yes my fellow texans stay alert because if anything happens we are on our own abbott will likely spend mins blaming the windmills then go back to his cocktail party while millions go without drinking water,0

that boy and girl just at the end of the report theyre so happy in spite of the invasion of their country those two are great,2
today years ago august millions of people from latvia lithuania and estonia formed the longest human chain ever km across the three countries to express their will to get rid of soviet totalitarism and imperialism few months later they eventually would become free independent states three countries i deeply respect at the frontline of stoneage barbarian russian imperialism,1
common sense i really think a lot more is needed,1
we need more britt coverage,2
monthsand at times we had to be reminded a war was going on,0
rumi a th century persian philosophers view on wars wars like childrens fights are meaningless pitiless and contemptible,0
have you considered why somehow the war should not be taken onto russian territory or russians should be in any way immune from the horrors of the war of conquest that russians have started the trillions in damage the russians have done to ukraine in terms of infrastructure and lost economic output the s of thousands of people theyve killed the millions of people theyve displaced,0
if you can t sleep at night just listen to joe biden you will go to bed within minutes no need to buy an app,2
but its okay to invade ukraine but once russia is getting attacked its a crime,0
wars are worst things in life and sadly we keep continuing same mistakes because of bloody old politicians who thirst for wars for their interests and leave people die all governments are involved in world and no one is innocent imagine no wars everywhere and peace but that is impossible because evils surround us,0

the problem with this that by focusing on totally different thing rather than better content we subscribers are paying the price with increasing subscription fee,0
netflix is getting into video games for the same reason apple is launching a car and amazon is getting into healthcare these high high tech company have to constantly keep growing in order to justify their insane valuations and in many cases their core businesses wont offer enough revenue to satisfy investors growth expectations,1
netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors this move into gaming will not do them any favours,0
the reason netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its good is constantly neglected and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults people are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update people are used to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking to years to release even before covid,0
when i first got into watching netflix there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and tv series on it however in recent times i feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone,2
this is the problem with these big companies their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent,0
i worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing i have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do,0
i think it s so silly that netflix feels the need to compete with youtube and tiktok i think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products eg people can follow along with reactionsreviews and video essays while watching a netflix series people also don t typically like when youtubers are given a large budget like with youtube red originals so netflix buying out certain youtubers is not the right idea,0
honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original ips yeah it takes longer to come out but you ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment,2
i think this is gonna take netflix back to its feets it just needs more perseverance and the ability to be positive minded,2
what s your favorite sport,1

im surprised getting all the collectibles didnt even get an honorable mention theres been more than enough people who couldnt the arkham games simply because they didnt like the riddler trophy collecting quest especially arkham knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile just for those collectibles,0
the one that annoyed me was the borderlands when to obtain you had to play online with someone from gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy they changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once,0
i always adored ffviii my older brother gifted me with the strategy guide when i first bought it so that may have something to do with it lol that said if youre trying to ffviii on the og north american release good luck a strategy guide will not help you get the ribbon,2
the original infamous hurt my soul i played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while i was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be completed post game i had all but one stunt to knock enemies off a roof at once when you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt i didnt have it in me to start another campaign the sad part is i had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt,0
ac was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry problem was the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like do not touch water,0
multiplayer trophies tied to the platinum will always always be the worst,0
multiplayer and single player trophiesachievements should be separate as their own completion lists,1
so glad you did multiplayer awards lumped with single player awards that is the biggest bullshit for single game players that dont want to listen to children screaming neck beards eating or just racist hateful crap just for a trophy,0
i honestly feel like cod mw on did it best on xbox achievements for single player and challenges for multiplayer that was now i m with a wife and kids it s almost unimaginable trying to do a game with multiplayer supporting a family and working,2
you guys are really getting your moneys worth with the new background music,2

the only unrealistic part is having consistent connection with very little delay because even in this decade big pings and lags is still a common occurences,0
as someone living in the future i can confirm that this is perfectly accurate,2
i remember doing this back in good times talking about his mother,2
the very little time delay is the reason why its still considered something in the future,1
this honestly sounded like a legitimate prediction until the last part xd,2
wow the concept of sending games over the internet lines sounds so compelling i wish online multiplayer was real,2
impossible nothing like that could ever be made,0
man i love seeing old media predict the future correctly they even showed the lack of joy all gamers have,2
implying that this insult has been passed down for decades quickly we must continue the legacy,0
wow im so excited for the future alongside flying cars is looking to be rad,2
let s take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his for us great job mate,2
the skins just got released and hes the first one who ive seen that have it love this content him and other fortnite youtubers make,2
was not expecting this collab thank you for the daily content you always kill it for us d,2
love the videos and the work you put into it keep it up,2
best man ever his content is always good,2
keep it up tg love the content,2
as a destiny veteran and current destiny tourneys player i think they did pretty good with zavala and the others ikora and exo stranger,2
massive thank you to everyone for checking out the video i went back and forward on making it whether it was too negative or not but very reassuring to know its not just me noticing these things and wanting to talk about them cheers scott,2
i adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year if a game comes out in i wait until i get it at its cheapest and usually complete i have been doing this with every game i buy for the last years and i have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more,2
i used to preorder games to get the collectible toy that was sought after the items got really cheap really fast not worth it they also tell you that there may not be enough copies that never happened there was always enough copies,0
good video these are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now publishers developers the media and gamers themselves have to throw one in though for every game with a yearly release i also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle how long between gta and fallout and skyrim and elder scrolls,2
i wish developers would realize that forced drm and internet connectivity for games is a step backward look at the debacles gt and simcity have endured whats the point of paying a full for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for singleplayer modes in my opinion at that point you cant help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job this is not why people play games,0
when i think about the games i played the last few years i must say that i almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big ips so i rather pay for an indie title that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting on a broken aaa title without any innovations,2
great vid points are spot on only or years ago feels like i bought every major release at midnight and after cyberpunk fallout no mans sky i m never buying a day one game again my gaming and spending habits have completely changed the gaming biz can t devolve and expect players to keep up the old pace,1
i havent bought a game on release for the past years now the gaming industry has changed for a while now and its only getting worse i buy games per year at most and usually heavily discounted quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays cod and battlefield lost their way quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy goty editions usually and often second hand gotta love disc edition systems i refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers,0
i tend to stick to games made before as they give the best value and experience feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player,2
this video made me a bit sad made me realise how the industry has changed and not for the better i have young children so can t game like i used to but when i do have time i find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that i ve played before but adore the vast majority of new games just don t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles what s the point all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games yawn,0
one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieved something he always regular us the audience his team and he is polite in all his video we congratulatiet ourselves on this achievement more to come,2
let s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative,2

technically ramp buggy isnt suppose to be used as an offroad vehicle it is a street vehicle thats classified as offroad because its pretty much a buggy with a ramp on its hood to windshield,0

very relaxing video it helped me sleep,2
ive been around for every console generation i remember thinking during the genesisturbografx era snes not out quite yet what games would be like when i was old and the kind of specs they would need obviously i had no idea what the specs really meant back then but i was thinking bit lol as for the cpu and bit is all we really need for that they have happily progressed faster than i had imagined looking just as good today if not better then i imagined things would look like years from now the s and early s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the gpu were the main things that took us to where we are hardware wise,2
we are an architecture and construction company in chile and we have used unreal engine for a long time and it is the best for realtime visualization the preview versions of unreal were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting lumion really changed everything its great that this is being talked about not only in games but also in movies and other experiences like ours there are plenty of tutorials to learn we did it that way out of fear to learn it,2
i think id like more deformable terrain breaking glass environments affected by weather systems world changes that arent static and that change etc and improved methods of moving like verticality rather than just wasd it feels like more fidelity comes at the expense of exploring deeper game modes imho,1
horizon forbidden west god of war ragnarok gran turismo pioner elden ring feel free to complete by clicking on reply,1
i actually home every game system dating back to my atari i never ever thought games would look this good i cant imagine how they will look years from now with how fast technology keeps moving forward,2
im over the moon hyped for the day before i hope it delivers in the hype like elden ring did if thats even possible for developers other than fromsoft,2
most games these days look mind blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first started with games like pong etc,2
i think we ve reached the point that these devs need to come up with better idea and a for decades now they just been able to make games look better a lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale ideas and dumbed down mechanics than older games,0
these games look insane cant wait to play some of them great list by the way,2
im so glad i built a nice high end rtx pc a year ago its incredible the amount of eye candy k gaming treats us with no wonder its the biggest money making entertainment industry on the planet thanks for those awesome little previews nicely presented too much appreciated,2

whats your dream specsize for a gaming monitor,1
wow im impressed think theyve set a new bar with that spec and it being a,2
this monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels i like how it s got a tilt adjustable stand as well nice video,2
on your future review will you give us a comprehensive analysis on the antiglare matte screen is the matte coating embedded within the panel or is it another layer do you notice any sacrifices on color and sharpness because of the matte finish do you find its brightness setting to be adequate for an oled monitor during productivity use how aggressive is abl in your testing please let us know thank you,1
my favorite part of this tv is basically tv size is the custom heatsink i dont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesnt dim the brightness constantly,2
great video i think ill still be leaning toward the c though as the price difference at the moment is too appealing,2
awesome review what are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the lg c does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality i want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the c at a cheaper price this or perhaps wait another year for something new,2
oled gaming wow please compare to the c you had as a monitor side by side to see that contrast difference uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the c and this love your content,2
thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review my dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wide but mhz instead of k because not even a ti will do anywhere near k mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway if possible i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review what do resolutions other than k look like on the monitor try playing a game in and seeing what the monitors scaling is like in the settings what hdr options are available thanks,2
hi spawnpoiint im looking forward to the complete review youre the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer ive seen one thing id like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen ideally a sidebyside in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer dont know if thats feasible for you in any case thanks for the work and enjoy,2
post game depression never really hit me until undertale and now every chapter of deltarune i dont know if its because im getting old and soft or if theyre just that good,0
nd meme i have tainted such an innocent soul,0
i relate to the first one smt fallout and persona i m playing they come in and they re just like wth is this,1
these memes are kind of nostolgic especially the l and r one,1
st meme my dad had gotten me resident evil i had fallen in love with it but my dad saw my explode a granados head and got really surprised at the amount of violence in this rated game,2
the r l one is so relatable i had a transformers game on the wiiu a while back and it took me months to figure it out,2
as a person who very rarely plays console and hasnt owned one for over years i can very much relate to not knowing where the buttons are my friends are all going ok now just press rt then lt then a and go left and im there constantly checking where the buttons are right top left top a and left,0
i thought it was just me with the end of game depression it hits hard,0
finishing a game is like finishing a book just wish i could experience it for the first time again,1

theory karl is actually the master mind behind everything that has happened in the long drive and he is testing you,1
theory why karl has a wierd collision box hes a mesh thats not supposed to be in the game but evreyone likes him so the devs just left him,1
theory the reason why you saw a second karl might have something to do with abandoned cars like cristine karl is the first abandoned car and over time it withered and due to the desert heat its paint melted all over it making it all covered in blue paint and eventually a bunny accidently glitched in there and died and theyre soul got sucked in creating the first karl which then killed the player and over time the karl became more and more smart and even attained sentience and started converting other cars into karls and karrot and karla were his first ones which had a few problems which is why they are diffrent eventually karl found out about you and how many times you abandoned cristine and the last time you did he converted all of the old ones he kept on finding new ones not going back and getting them back and are now mad at you and your stupid sedan it also explains why he keeps coming back,1
keep up the great content really enjoy it when you play the long drive,2
by far my most favourite series camodo good job all is appreciated,2
theory karl is trying to help the player but like the mothman it brings destruction and death,0
try dusting the cobwebs away from karl with the duster and you might be in for a secret as they stop from physical objects being touched like seats and items etc,1
there are three types of people in this world the ones who prefer gaming the ones who prefer watching videos and the one who spend their day trying to entertain their subscribers thank you camodo you never deceive us keep up the good work oh and btw you know that you can refill your paint can by pressing r on another paint can even if the other can is another color it doesn t matter,2
theory karl is a creation made by the dev that was supposed to help you but has gone wrong and is trying to hunt the players and scare them,0
gotta love lenovo got the ryzen h version of this laptop with the same after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and i couldnt have been happier it was in italy at the time paired with my wacom cintiq and a ram upgrade its been the perfect little gaming and digital painting set up,2
people have been going crazy for the gigabyte g kd going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i h and rtx would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is,2
lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market my first introduction to pc gaming was a p lenovo with sli ms was a killer deal too back when the series was nvidias newest line i remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before i got it i havent gotten anything lenovo since as i build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops but i will always appreciate and respect what lenovo does,2
i managed to snag a msi gf thin uc with a i h rtx gb ram hz display and gb nvme storage for euros,1
nice definitely a great value i still have my old lenovo m gb gaming laptop i never upgraded it from gb of ram and that wouldve been an easy move for more performance now it doesnt make sense as i upgraded to an alienware with a and gb of ram but i still sometimes fire up the lenovo to see what it can do in,2
i just bought this today on best buy for dollars love to see your making a video on it,2
recently bought a lenovo legion laptop for on ebay h ti gb rams and ssd never been happier lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops also they aren t to flashy,2
i got an older version of the ideapad gaming with a but with a ryzen h and a gb ssd its an amazing laptop but i bough it at the time last year for not a bargain but a well balanced laptop for work and gaming,2
i have the model from mine has an i h and a mobile gtx this is a great machine aside from some plastic chipping due to the lid being opened and closed it annoyingly was with discounts,2
this laptop has the core thread i h not the core thread h big difference and you need to update your video description accordingly also when you took it out of the box the battery was not dead lenovo laptops will not power on for the first time unless the charger is plugged in,1
you know it s gaming when mkbhd uploaded fps vid,1
oh boy cant wait to buy it in years when theyre in stock,2
sony play has no limits ps stock are u sure about that,1
never thought id say this but i got my ps today its absolutely breathtaking,2
who else still doesn t have the ps,1
truly excellent overview concise and informative i genuinely feel better equipped to make my decision regarding the playstation after watching your review appreciate you and your consistently fine work,2
just stumbled upon your channel after successfully ordering a ps yesterday through sony direct the anticipation of it getting delivered made me want to watch some unboxings and reviews i came across your channel and immediately clicked because we have the same last name which is neat haha i actually really enjoyed your video it s informative offers great insight and very professional while maintaining a personal creative nuance thank you,2
i got the controller alone for use on my pc and im shocked that it works so natively well of course none game that i know of uses the trigger gimmick but the soundvibration feedback works like a charm sure it does require some set up but it works,2
i honestly think marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,2
the controller really is the coolest thing about the ps astro s playroom is insane with the haptics,2
can we take a moment appreciate the level of effort norman put into this video the research facts analysis and narration are top notch i love the visual aspects like magazines figures gone box art and trinkets great job norm,2
the part where theyre talking about the initial rollout of the snes in north america hits home they mention something about how expensive it was for the time and how the state of the us economy in meant it was probably the only toy the average american parent could buy their kids that year took up the entire toy budget that happened to my family christmas and all my brothers and sisters are there of us ranging from to years old my parents had a single present for the of us the super nintendo with super mario world it was one of the best gifts of all our lives because we had all wanted the snes badly we literally played it all that christmas eve night and into christmas day its a great family memory that we all still hold with us now all in our s and s with families of our own,1
dude wtf this should be on netflix or something just wow,1
being an s baby s kid it just feels like a blessing to have experienced all this first hand,2
this is hands down the best nintendo documentary i have seen in my entire life huge video game fan im now and getting those memories back is awesome along with tones of things i didnt know cheers,2

this music is amazing,2
love it,2
i like this kind of music very much,2
time stamps intro tactical obama echo coffee popsicle bagel bagel again sonic purple cupcake chocolate coconut outro,1
first time getting into watching the asmr gaming kinda videos been into asmr things for about years idk why i havent watched these sooner this was actually super enjoyable and entertaining to watch hell yea loved it,2
i love how he randomly used obama as a trigger word,2
that tactical one just hits home man like its crazy,1
sometimes i come here to sleep sometimes i come here for commentary sometimes i come here for gameplay you really have it all and i love watching someone who s passionate abt what they do and is as much of a geek as i am keep up the incredible work d,2
hello asmr gaming news love ur videoskeep it up,2
the words that agn says with syllables just hit different like tactical and coconut,1
hi could you try to make a video in french its my language thanks in advance and keep up the good work ps your videos are very relaxing,2
very relaxing video it helps me sleep and relax,2
the fake slide is unfair to the defense you pursue that and get penalized as a defender,0
for people complaining on the fake slide it was absolutely legal at the time of the play and was a glaringly awful loophole in the rules it was changed as a direct result of that play,0
seein bill get all excited like that describing the play just let s you know how exciting and high iq ed reed was in his time him and troy are the best safeties i ve seen in my lifetime by far,2
im not into sports at all but damn i am so amazed at how these guys can act like one mind with a single thought just incredible cooperation,2
new video idea can you do the game is not over yet moments,1
people dont realize exactly how hard that steven adamsrussell westbrook play was not only did he have to miss the free throw and have it bounce back at him he had to get the rebound then quickly get the ball out to russ and russ had to make a rushed deep three,1
polamalu jumping over the line against the titans is extra smart because he knows that even if hes too early its a flag but just half the distance to the goal theyre already so close to the goal line that it doesnt matter,2
in case you re wondering why the clock didn t stop at that obj play the rule states that if you aren t gaining yards while going out of bounds the clock keeps running this is a great example of obj he can t just catch but he can run throw kick you name it,2
wow what an incredibly well researched video so many great moments and some i havent even seen before only wish you wouldve included when alex smith hid the ball from the refs but great video nonetheless,2
the fact chris paul knew that rule is impressive,2
what a game of football the passion the fights refereeing decisions all of it this is why we love the premier league,2
passion aggression goals assists push n pulls yellow and red cards celebrations and fights this is something us man utd fan wish to see in our team but can only see in other teams epl at its best moments kudos to the two epl contenders great match,2
the volley was great but cucurella s cross was also a thing of beauty,2
most exciting game of football i ve seen in a long time it had everything,2
conte once a chelsea friend now a devoted foe that was colddddd,0
what a goal by koulibaly what a crazy game what a handshake,2
i dont see many commenting on the foul that took havertz down and led to spurs first goal that should have been a card and a free kick it was clearly a foul in the replay no wonder tuchel was so steamed for the rest of the match,0
imagine youre a manchester fan and you here watching this brilliant game,2
i m a chelsea fan chelsea vs tottenham are always some of my very favorite match days of the season they never ever fail to excite,2
if this is only the nd week of the premiere league i cant wait for what the rest of the season brings the beautiful game the passionate game,2
im years old this music rocks my world,2
i literally ran from my house to the forest near the park that s near my house and started playing this cause today i felt magical,2
ive been out of high school for years in may its not very often that i hear a newer song and get sent back to the musical equivalent of me in ive been trying to do some trauma healing using this song and i think ive made some progress slowly but surely i am starting to love myself again after years of just trying to survive wilist hating myself i may not be happy now but im on the road to being there i dont care if nobody sees this i just know im getting better and thats all that matters,2
why do i start crying every time this plays no reason i just do i love this song,2
this music is amazing god my heart stumbled upon them whilst searching guitar videos for lessons now im playing along,2
i was never good at sports sis we all felt that,0
all her music is just so good like i can relate to most of it and the sounds in her music are so sad yet upbeat and happy ive never heard music like hers in my life and i really like it,2
this song is my go to whenever i feel something this song usually helps me go back to feeling empty thanks,2
i heard this song in a store once and it became one of my favorites i finally found it again love your music beach bunny,2
great sound and vibe reminds me of mid s college radio,2
i cannot believe how sherika closed that gap what a race well done terry to hold her off,1
why am i crying tee tee was running for her dear life because jamaica was on her tail like lightning amazing race athletes performing at the highest level,2
so proud of these ladies they beat a jamaican team with of the best sprinters we ve ever seen absolutely incredible,2
jenna prandini s leg was crazy she passed one of the greatest ever sprinters and put the usa in the lead wow,2
tee tee teri is such a sweetheart that face brings me to tears every time jamaica was trying to run her down little baby face teetee go girl go,2
beating thompsonherah fraserpryce and jackson in a single race is massive for any team on any stage,2
wow usa of them are rookies amazing beating the jamaican legends prandini is awesome on the curves all did what they had to do to win,2
when i saw melissa jefferson s reaction during the announcements i immediately knew usa was going to win she looked dialed in,2
shoutout to my american queens yall deserve everything and more,2
this was such an exciting race the jamaicans are so competitive i love it the germans emotions after making the podium was contagious,2
team jesus comment down below if your on his winning team,2
hurdleskicks a man is one of the best calls of all time,2
considering how many times antonio brown is in this id say the signs were definitely there,1
the funniest thing with westbrook s travel will always be curry asking him what are you doing and russ looking at him with complete sincerity and saying i don t know man was in his own head or stuck in practice mode or something,1
that marion barber back flip though rip legend,2
the funniest part about the baez thing is as soon as javy turned around the first baseman could have turned around and stepped on first and ended the inning,2
is a smart move shot clock doesnt move until he touches the ball but the game clock does roll,2
and jacobs fires the football into the playclock,1
when you randomly press aggressive tackle on madden,1
just for anyone who didn t catch it luck didn t quite lose yards,1
dp tour tickets available now,2
who else remembers when tyler would win every challenge,1
more than years later still waiting for the second annual all sports baseball battle,1
cody if someone hits inside the park youre in the clear baby cody hits inside the park,1
all you guys bring me happiness and joy to my days when i watch you,2
i know this video has been out a long time but i can t get enough of dude perfect,2
just saying that ever since cory shaved them eyebrows he has been straight fire in battles,2
years later still not done another annual baseball battle but still love the content keep it up,2
greatest come back ever although cory deserved to win,2
coby always deserves a second chance,2
video part,1
this quickly turned into very possible moments,2
it shows how deeply they are attached to their respective sport,1
some people are not only incredibly talented they work hard on their skills and perform what seems impossible stephan curry and tiger woods come to mind right away both work incredibly hard in practice and alone as well,2
best teammate in the history of the world he jumped off the bench and was cheering way before the ball went in,2
that man knows what he just did was impressive as hell he deserves to feel proud for that,2
love the inevitable evan longoria clip but right after that is the volleyball player going into the stands to keep the ball alive i m surprised that they allowed that,2
i loved that you added volleyball in this compilation more less popular sports need recognition like cricket dodgeball and badminton,2
incredible performances i just loved all the scenes shown just marvelous,2
i swear every half court shot when the time ends is epic,2
an amazing performance definitely maguires best performance in a united shirt,2
maguire needs a standing ovation for staying out of this one my god a real captains performance for sure,2
i m not a united fan but when i say this game gave me chills it reassured me why i watch the premier league,2
crazy seeing ronaldo on the bench it s really the beginning of a new era,2
this defense was really solid i can t wait to see the addition of casemiro with this coaching and this rebuilt defense we ll do really good this season,2
the fans were there for the players tonight and they didn t disappoint,2
the fans eruption on both goals and on the final whistle brought tears to my eyes,1
this game was very emotional for me the way we have played in recent seasons has been frustrating still early but this could be the start of something great,2
i like to see man utd fans happy they ve been thru a lot they deserve it,2
this is why we love epl even the games between bottom teams are so exciting,2
liked this video make sure to check out the top sports bloopers of the decade,2
i like the clips where someone makes one of the better plays ive seen and the announcer is like that is definitely one of the best plays this weekend,2
love the variety but the minneapolis miracle in the s while we got regular season mlb in the top cmon man,2
i forget how much i appreciate the other sports i m a hockey person but wow baseball the nfl wow even soccer when they re not crying on the field wow what great athletes,2
you know a canadian made this list when a damn curling highlight makes the cut,0

i played on the field for number i was in the australian juniour league world series team and had alot of memories come back to me from looking at the scenery,2
subscribe to enter the visa giftcard giveaway,1
so i learned when pitchers accidentally hit or almost hit someone they throw the perfect pitch for a homerun afterwards,1
this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different the game was over lol its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown the game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it the washington wizards were up by at that point even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just free throw and its over even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to tie the game in an impossible amount of time long story short that throw lost them the game after ot lol just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,0
the game was almost over and was a blowout at that point dallas buffalo yet check out don beebe still giving effort after the game bills owner ralph wilson walked from the owners booth to the locker room and thanked beebe for the play,2
being a packers fan i remember watching that game against the seattle seahawks where hassleback said they were going to score in ot and when al harris picked him off and took it back i remember my family and i was jumping up and down yelling and going nuts one of my favorite sports moments ever especially with my favorite team being the ones offering the karma back at hassleback,2
d hop breaking his ankles literally was by far the most savage,0
context for stanton fiers hit him in the jaw years prior breaking it and ending his season first atbat against fiers after he was hit and he gets hit again absolutely justified in watching it go,1
success is the best revenge my dad used to say and its true,2
pujols and trout taunting with the bow and arrow gestures was priceless,2
isnt even the whole story the last time giancarlo stanton faced fiers he hit him in the face ending his season and prompting reconstructive surgery thats the reason he and now many baseball players wear face flaps on their helmets the very next time they face off he hits him again even if unintentional thats nuts,0
hello friends,1
this is unreal congrats on doing this at such a special place,2
dude they actually got jim nantz to announce it legendary,2
i was watching this with my dad and he didnt believe they were actually at the masters its crazy great job to the editors the team and bryson big achievement to be able to play at one of the most prestigious places on earth,2
i feel like most people watching this video have idea how unbelievable it is that they were allowed to even be at augusta before the masters let alone play all sports golf there,0
it s always a blessing whenever they decide to play everybody s favorite battle another round of all sports golf,2
this is the greatest video ever made well done dude perfect bryson the full team,2
as much as i love seeing these battles i think the guys should change the frisbees to the disc golfing frisbees they travel farther than the regular ones,2
awesome video thanks to the masters management for allowing this great way to keep those youngsters involved very generous from the masters as always all class,2
i attended the masters on thursday and the woods on was a great place to stand for a while so many golfers ended up there and got to see them up close what a fantastic experience,2
this arsenal side is proving itself very nicely playing with a lot more fluidity what a signing gabriel has been for them,2
arsenals attack is so fluid and theyre playing so well man theyre fr looking real dangerous this season,2
all game the fans were loud and behind the team especially the saliba chant this team is different and they re together coyg,2
it s such a shame that the gabriel jesus goal was ruled offside he s playing out of his skin at the moment and deserved that goal zinchenko played amazing today marteneli and jesus are always a threat and xhaka has been playing well consistently under his new role and ofc we gotta talk about saliba so young yet he plays like a veteran special mention to ben white who s also been playing good at right back,2
wins won t guarantee us a top finish but it s better than defeats which is where we were last season,2
its great to see arsenal win the games they are supposed to win excited to see them against top competition,2
watching gabriel jesus in this team right now honestly puts such a huge smile on my face him and odegaard just fit so well together and the interplay between them and the wings is just so fun to watch finally happy watching arsenal play again,2
compared to the same time last year i feel like im living in the cloud games wins points goals scored with only goals allowed can you believe that for ones like tierney tomiyasu and smith rowe who were main starters for arsenal last season we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by i hope they can be patient grab the opportunities and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on compared to the last season this is a huge improvement the squad depth is so much thicker that we are using tomiyasu smith rowe and tierney as substitutes hopefully next week i would like to see vieira to make a debut even if its just for or minutes,2
arsenals got gabriels and all of them have been phenomenal,2
tears in my eyes i prayed for these times of having a solid team,2
it takes a really smart person to do a spiderman frontflip two meters high i wouldve never thought of that unreal iq,1
merci beaucoup pour ce moment moi et mon amis assis c t de moi sommes tr s satisfaits du divertissement propos dans cette vid o bonne continuation dans vos compilation jappr cie norm ment,1
what is even more amazing is that he used the support of his opponent s shoulder to facilitate his own rotation in midair i didn t see it the first time either,2
that was the best golf shot ive ever seen,2
incase anyone asks you can grab the puck in hockey if it is off the ground and the goalie isn t close enough to catch it you have to drop it after,1
i want more of these videos in my life so enjoyable to watch sport at its very best,2
no sport event anywhere in history can come near this one god himself,0
surely corner taken quickly should be up there too on the other hand its refreshing to not see federer this federer that when it comes to tennis,1
the last one wasnt great its a foul in footballing terms and always results in a yellow card other players have done the same and been booked for it too as did henry in that last clip,0
this is what literally every hockey team does when a player breaks a stick the only difference here is that he scored right after,1
only a hours after the game was over this time that s record speed good job guys,2
that diaz goal was reminiscent of his wonder goal vs peru in the copa amer in fact he scored like that a bunch of times for porto too class player,2
credit to crystal palace that was a great counterattack before the goal reminiscing of brentfords th on saturday,2
that luis diaz goal is an instant classic as a colombian i could not be happier,2
both goals scored were absolutely amazing what a result for palace wish nbc could ve uploaded this earlier though,2
milner was all over the pitch this game this man still has it,2
i love luis diaz so much what a player what a character,2
as a neutral fan i m really happy to see both zaha and diaz scoring both top tier players in the league,2
luis diaz has a big heart sharp teeth and an amazing attitude for liverpool sweetest of goals,2
luis diaz always showing great character and ready to sacrifice anything for this team,2
zlatan doesnt score impossible goals impossible goals score zlatan,1
when alexander graham bell invented the telephone he had missed calls from zlatan,1
zaltan doing martial arts in football match and ronaldo jumps more than an average nba player,1

king amazing video bro thank you,2
that love shared between canelo and plant man is something else you have a beautiful family you are my family i love this sport,2
plant and canelos postfight talk is honestly one of the best moments ive ever seen great stuff before the bell in the ring and after the fight,2
canelo and plants speech gave me the chills man he was truly sad he lost the fight,0
the fact that jake and logan are featured is hilarious to me,2
its really great to see canelo fight over the years and progress as a fighter enjoy him while you can fellas boxing is in great hands,2
wow highlighting the conversation during the fight and after the fight was awesome classy for both fighters great job showtime,2
that exchange canelo and plant had was deep and with all due respect,2
i like jermell charlo ive met him more than a couple of times and hes a cool guy but castano won that fight imo,2
a o de canelo,2
wow what saul said after the fight made me tear up a little you are my family now respect,2
part coming soon youtube decided to cut my upload in half for some reason so the rest of the video will be uploaded later this week,2
i love how in the first one he immediately turns to the penalty box like i know the drill guys,2
made me laugh way harder than it should have,2
i still remember seeing mugsy bogues nail a morethan half court gamewinning shot at the buzzer in the early s also for the hornets,1
i love how at minutes the thunder happens and the pitcher just drops everything and turns around like nope im gonna dip yall have fun,2
im amazed at how players are able to react in the moment in ways that seem superhuman and then sometimes they dont even react as if it was special,2
dave winfield of the new york yankees accidentally hit and killed a seagull with a baseball in toronto vs the blue jays august he was charged with cruelty to animals and an autopsy was even done on the seagull it created a lot of controversy here in toronto,0
worth watching worth sharing excellent content delivered as advertised thank you,2
the jags v texans one always kills me the db did exactly what you re taught to do don t go for the int just knock it down much more effective than trying to go up with an nfllevel receiver just so unlucky lmao,0
very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected i remember my wife was given a free ticket to a diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said i got bored with the game the diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game i teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the yankees and luis gonzalez base hit that won the game i met joe montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and i saw the ending in french in montreal in during my flight from sfo to toronto and the connecting flight to montreal our air canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout i also will never forget the stanfordcal game in and the play when cal beat stanford and the band became part of the game some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for cal was as it was and i still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history my own crazy moment was when i was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though i was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so i agreed we won the game though i had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game adrenalin had me psyched and our qb said i threw perfect spirals i would intimidate the bigger players since they feared id plow under them and stop them from getting to the qb and they never did he was not sacked our team went on to win the norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though i no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders i never went on to play in high school feeling i was too small to be as good as i was in my grammar school game where i also played on the defense and i stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which i enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and i was decent at the as it was then now the meters even in my early s now and despite a leg i broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago i still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing on my channel here cactus i even have a video of me jumping off the vegas stratosphere tower when i was though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered i felt peace and not fear on the way down choosing that vs skydiving as my free fall bucket list item since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane,2
you know it s a good game when there s minute highlights,2
kevin de bruyne is insane newcastle need to be taken seriously this season,0
saint max on his day can break down any press man incredible so fun to watch definitely one of those streets will never forget kind of players,2
it s not even about the draw against the champions for me it s the way howe has newcastle playing free attractive positive going forward football and no fear of great opposition wow genuinely love to see it,2
this game was insane as much as a win would be satisfying i would take a draw all day over a loss respect to newcastle what an amazing game edit k likes idk how to feel about this lmao,2
couldve never predicted how amazing of a midfielder joelinton has become,2
my god kdb is insane his vision and passing skills are absolutely generational havent seen anything like it since xavi and sneijder,2
i m a city fan but respect to newcastle i hope they do really well this season it s scary to think that newcastle haven t even went crazy with expensive signings yet when they do it s gonna be terrifying,1
well done magpies saintmaximin attacking with pace at man city defense is a blue print for rest of epl,2
emotional day havent seen a newcastle side play that well against man city no less in a very long time gutted but grateful to get a point in the end just a heroic team performance could single every player in the starting xi out for praise just so proud of all of them as for city ill just say i clapped as soon as i saw de bruyne had played silva in on goal just phenomenal football i mean at times during that match it was terrifying when city had possession a wonderful side and a wonderful manager,2
throwin it back to our old school trick shot days thanks for watching guys we seriously appreciate you a ton,2
i see you cody with those frisbee skills im impressed,2
how has this not become a series yet great job dudes,2
man these all these trick shots are so dope wish i daily s be like you guys in the future,2
thanks coby for giving some love to badminton i really love the sport and it feels great that you can shine a spotlight on it once in a while,2
can we just appreciate that they got a baseball field football field hockey rink and a soccer field just for one video edit thank you for all the likes i ve never gotten this many,2
shout out to all my badminton players out there i know your sport doesnt get alot of love thats hits me right in the feels man thank you,2
i loved the garret in this video he had sooooooo much energy,2
i know i m not the only one going back during quarantine and rewatching all the dude perfect vids in fact they inspired me and i do my own trickshots on this channel,2
the question is did ty break the record for the world s longest strike,1
world record,1
i always love seeing the coaches reaction just celebrating someone elses success together feels good even to watch,2
two of those records have already been broken caeleb dressels m butterfly was broken by himself at the olympics with a time of sec and that of inessa kravets in womens triple jump was beaten by yulimar rojas from venezuela with mts also in the tokyo olympics,1
for women s triple jump yuliana rojas of venezuela broke the record she made a jump of m in tokyo,1
stefka georgieva kostadinova is a bulgarian retired athlete who competed in the high jump her world record of metres has stood since,1
just saw duplantis won the olympics hes definitely a legend making all those jumps to the gold medal not a single fail,2
fastest red card the only world record i could achieve,2
a by o przyjemnie popatrze,1
the world record that i remember with pleasure is the first in a total of of federica pellegrini in she was unjustly disqualified in the semifinal of her favorite race the sl so the next day she made the sl record in her career she also made a couple of records the same day but the first was particular,2
jarmila kratochv lov who holds the current m world record of set on july in munich is definitely missing from the video this record is the longest ever official world record in womens athletics also missing is jan elezn the current world record holder in javelin throw m from jena on may,1
one of the best races i have ever seen,2
the longest shot has won the kentucky derby gives me chills and make me smile what a quote and a race,2
simplemente incre ble esto jam s ser olvidado,1
ive never watched a single kentucky derby race in my years here on earth but this just gave me chills all down my body the longest shot has won the kentucky derby is going right down in history,1
well probably never see something like this again legitimately one of the coolest things ive ever seen in my life,2
in all honesty this might be the greatest kentucky derby victory of all time the longest shot passes the favorite right at the end you can t write a story better than that,2
i can t get enough of this race the way he says rich strike in the end is legendary,2
that friggin horse looked like a running back cutting back and across midstride breaking for daylight then breaking it open to the end zone awesome display of athleticism horse and jockey,2
it s such a treat seeing spectacles like this good for rich strike even if this horse does not win anymore rich strike is in the history books,2
rewatching this and watching rich strike the whole way knowing what s about to happen and hearing the announcers reaction i got chills up and down my spine what an unbelievable race,2
enjoy the thumbnail hahahahahaha,2
lets all admit it we are here because of thumbnail,1
give that guy on the tennis court an a for attitude good sense of humor,2
i wouldve dropped everyone around me,0
love the videos gonth,2
yo gonth love your channel and i love you vids they have been helping me through lockdown keep it up man,2
correction in south africa kaiser chiefs fans take it too far,0
after he punched grealish grealish went on and scored a late winner,1
the reason for the beach balls in israel a team that doesn t play well is going to the beach so their fans threw beach balls because they sucks,0
the man hitting grealish is my favourite clip man what a legend,2
i don t know why but the cop cheering for papi s home run always makes me laugh,2
i honestly can feel the pain without being the one in pain,1
i ll never understand opposing teams not helping a player outunawareness aside such a stupid thing help each other out,0
i love how the cleanup crew beats the medical crew to do their job,2
that guy was my best friend as a young kid we went to school together great guy i will forever cherish this clip as teasing material,2
that golden state warrior doing the splits always makes me laugh,2
this father actually died from the fall trying to get his son a ball so sad,0
man at got crossed so bad he did a split hilarious,0
crashing on hard plywood floors in basketball worstpossiblepain,0
this is the type of video that i like showing one clip after another without five minutes of talk and leadup to each one yes we can figure them out all by ourselves good job,2
jest mistrz ten koszykarz,1
s podia ser o iniesta pra mudar a hist ria hajahajahaja,1
would be called a triple doink well maybe if it hit the uprights only three times but it hit four times so i think the quadruple doink is more fitting,1
that cheerleader got her head in the game all puns intended thank you for this video theyre all great,2
to be fair even if he had caught it he was probably coming down out of bounds,1
i give props to the ball boy for going up the floor instead of trying to retreat because if he would have retreated there would have been a collision,1
he pushed it into his own net,1
this season alone harry maguire would have occupy half of the spots here,1
the right side of the midfield is gonna be an absolute quagmire went right over my head,0
after all the hate towards the americans at leeds this was absolutely deserved,1
aaronson becoming a star is awesome to see as well as marsch s slap handshake at the end,2
hopefully we stop hearing about how much trouble leeds are in without raphinhaphillipsbamford i love all but we have replaced them well,2
it s crazy how nobody has mention how big rodrigo been these past games he is an amazing player before the prem and he is finally showing his potential that he had since his valancia days,2
i ve been a huge aaronson fan for a while now dude is an absolute lightning bolt and refuses to quit every time he plays for usmnt he provides a spark glad to see him doing well,2
very impressed with leeds united so far love how aaronson has no quit in him and has a lot of heart glad to see american players doing well in the premier league with aaronson and adams hope they keep this up throughout the season,2
that first goal is exactly why u need a striker who presses the ball,1
what a freaking start for jesse marsch and the squad lets gooooo,2
might not have world class quality but they have world class commitment pressing and energy very fun and promising performance,2
aaronson is a must start at the world cup,2
finally maguire used in a brilliant way what a game for harry,2
god bless ten hag finally mu has a manager with balls i pray he gets time to implement his vision and philosophy,2
games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this liverpool team but the early indications are that the liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources as a long time lfc supporter i cant help but compare the decision to let sadio mane go to the same situation with xavi alonso some years back i think that j klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top position this year hope i am wrong but if i am being honest man utd should have been up at halftime,0
they missed man and nobody wants to admitted sorry,0
martinez is all of in his height a giant among giants,2
three weeks in and the table is unrecognizable,0
i m not over excited because man u usually turn up against the big teams we are good at counter attacking but against teams that sit back is when we struggle,2
love that rashford didn t make that first question about himself knowing he hadn t any goal contributions in the prem in months he put the club first class,2
if liverpool dont sign at least players midfielders before the transfer window closes making top will be very difficult and as for vvd looks like he is getting too complacent this season,0
just imagine the hype of this team if they had won their two other games,1
perisic has brought so much offensive danger to the wings for spurs which is deadly considering someone of kanes quality waiting for those headers,0
not that impressed with how spurs are controlling a game but thoroughly impressed by their resolve and determination every game so far this season they ve faced stiff competition and they keep rising to the challenge it s awesome to see no matter where they go,2
really good response in the second half have to start games better if we want to win against the better teams though,2
wolves are so close to being a top flight team however glad to see spurs come out on top,2
that goal was proper training ground,1
years ago yearold perisic was denied by manchester united reason was too old for the squad years later yearold perisic hold more trophies than manchester united has for past years landing in spurs with minutes plays he made assists at the same time manchester united has scored only goal in games own goal by the opposite very nice of manchester,1
i feel as though spurs is not overwhelmingly great compared to other top teams in bpl but what makes them so deadly is their continuous pressure and effort which shows around nd half,0
as a sad wolves fan im actually encouraged by how well they played after this start though im already scared,2
fun fact more goals to go and harry kane will become tottenhams all time record goal scorer jimmy greaves st with goals kane nd with goals,2
the play at suprised me hopefully jimenez regains his confidence and plays like this more,2
i like coby s attitude even though he fails a lot he s always on the positive side keep on going coby,2
ty is phaenomenal every time i think no way he is finishing the last one but he really thrives under the pressure his mentality is outstanding but regardless of the outcome each and every video is a massive team effort,2
whats most impressive is how the editors managed to extend a minute song into mins without sounding boring,2
ive literally watched this dozens of times over the last years its one of the best,2
almost years since this came out and i m still watching it,1
videos never disappoint,2
whenever i see this video in my recommended i always have the urge to watch it every single time theres no stopping it anybody else have that,2
combining the joke with cody s laugh makes this amazing lol,2
flashback when coby said aren t baseballs supposed to go farther than tennis balls,1
congratulations dude perfect for reaching views,2
de bruyne brilliant as always nice to see haaland can get the assists as well as the goals,2
it s crazy how much haaland can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too it s gonna be even scarier,0
haaland should ve gotten the ball a couple times however he opened up so much space just by being on the pitch he is a threat and the teams know it,1
kevin de bruyne world class as usual haaland shouldve at least gotten on the scoresheet if foden squared him in but at least he got an assist he can still find a way to contribute without goals,2
seems like man city still haven t fully adapted to haaland at least more goals would ve been scored if they had given him the ball in the right areas,1
that first half was a masterclass by kdb and that goal using the outside of his foot was terrific,2
foden cant do that bs that was a tap in for haaland,0
adam smith should have been given a red card,0
man city playing so well so far but i feel like some city players arent giving halland a chance give it some games and that will change,1
if i was haaland would have been pissed at foden too,0
his freshmen year of highschool he could only throw mph me who s a senior and still hasn t broken,1
honestly you can t even be surprised that bauer acts the way he does he grew up bullied by kids and adults who always told him he was nothing and worthless that shit stays with you,0
will you make people stop cheating no alright then im just going to openly use the method of cheating and tell anyone and everyone,0
as someone who was bullied heavily as a kid i can see theres a few outcomes of that sort of situation and one of them is people become complete antisocial assholes like bauer,0
he had his own exercise routine and tool for achieving pitching success if i were the coach i would not obstruct thatas long as no one was hurt in the process those that were angry at him because he didnt the linetheir linethen its an issue of control over him so hes eccentriclet him be eccentricas long as no one gets hurt including himself just let him lose and let the team win,1
he literally said i m going to cheat too if nobody wants to stop everyone else he was the one who made it so public and now we have umpires checking all the time,0

i did this playing soccer for my high school during a game very memorable and always fun to think back on,2
bro you did my boy wrong by calling him talentless hippy,0
is just a rare footage of lionel messi practising headers,1
the boat saving the balls is litteraly the goat,0
bro the random dog on the soccer field stopping the goal like he s airbud has me in tears,0
home plate cams take foul tips surprisingly often they are almost always leased lenses and they always have a skylight filters in front of the lens the optical cost is more than made up for by breaking a filter admittedly instead of a lens k theres a reel of that from the little league world series where the same camera takes a hit twice in the same game,1
that freethrow alone tells you green can be upgraded unless he starts shooting the three at a percentage contested and to percent wideopen upgrade him warriors,1
i remember one of those one in a trillion moments playing ultimate frisbee in gym class i made a diving catch and i complete a pass for a score while on my knees,1

the best part of this is that its the offical video but the vocals were clearly recorded live for this its not the recorded version in the album its messy and its awesome,2
one of my favorite songs my old roommatebestfriend and i would scream at the top of our lungs drunk out of our minds ill miss you everyday oliver rip,2
rip benjamin vall today we learned of the death of the viagra boys guitarist at the age of his playing style was a big part of the bands success,1
i never realized that this song is different than the studio version this dude actually did this live lmaooo,1
this is the ideal male body you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like,2
liverpool just be handing out points to everyone out here i guess that s what they mean by you ll never walk alone,1
im honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos keep it up,2
without mane liverpool will be out of th place definitely last few years mane was the inigitator of attacking force ofthe team,1
post the highlights already,1
liverpool is such a disappointment even scrubs like man u can get the better of them smh,0
the rise of the reds,1
fighting inflation more like with a fed funds interest rate is like stopping a forest fire with a bucket of water folks prepare accordingly make investment in other not to depend on the government for funds,1
hate these stupid zoom conferences,0
congrats winnipeg open and jr open programs,2
i hope they keep adding sports always had a blast with boxing,2
this game looks fantastic it originally seemed like a barebones sequel to the wii games but its shaping up to be a really fun experience character customization tons of modes great music and visuals online and free updates im happy hopefully more sports will be added beyond golf id love to see baseball and boxing make a return,2
this game looks great i cant wait to play it the badminton especially looks like it will be a lot of fun and the survival bowling is such a cool idea will definitely be buying this when it comes out,2
when it comes to in game customization i go crazy for it so far from what i ve seen if that in this game i m super hyped,2
i absolutely loved baseball in wii so i hope it comes as a dlc since golf is coming i really hope they continue adding sports,2
it s crazy how this is my mostanticipated game right now i always wanted a more fleshed out version of wii sports and this looks to be it hopefully we get some of the resort sports added later on,2
i mostly want this due to the customization i would love to see some nintendo themed outfits in the game maybe as prizes for online events it would be cool to wear splatoon outfits or dress up as mario characters for example,2
would be cool to see more sports getting in the game via updates would love to see waterpolo surfing kayaking as water based sports ice hockey ski ng and snowboarding as winter sports but also skating skateboarding basketball baseball as more summer based sports i could see a very special potential for other uses for the leg strap like keeping in balance in surfing and snowboarding making a triangle shape to break in ski ng and do some tricks like flips in skateboarding,2
one of the biggest things i had against this game was the lack of miis but its nice to see that theyre here i will definitely buy this game,2
i hope they add more sports i feel like a lot of the current ones are pretty similar so it would be nice to see some new ones come in,2
that girl chugging the beer is pretty loyal lol,2
love it i just could not stop laughing,2
i cant stop laughing with all those cute animals on the field,2
zach hample eating it is classic hahahaha,2
i think a chuggalug girl could give me the problems that i have been missing,1
prop not knowing how to throw,0
thats the real reason troy retired,1
i absolutely played with utah in video games what was lebron talking about the jazz were unstoppable in video games,2
someone needs to take that glove away before he pokes an eye out,0
thank you for the lack of basketball highlights,0
loved the season opener look back as a kid who went the games with my pops he worked at byu his entire career years always had season tickets my dad passed away last october with a long painful battle with cancer with all the ugly evil things going on on the world byu football basketball was our time to just hangout and enjoy being together although my dad was a little to crazy dealing with traffic and parking,2
finally finally a properly done highlight video no annoying commentating and no useless history on the players or the plays play after play after play awesome job,2
the simpson flip really is incredible looks like something youd see in a movie about someone gaining super powers and taking advantage of it by playing football,2
i m not a golf fan but that putt is one of the most impressive things i ve ever seen in sports,2
i thought i was going to end up skimming or closing out this video early but this video was very well edited i was hooked on each play back to back without feeling bored the audio also was well balanced too and didnt have to worry about the next play being too loud or too soft just like what drummer said a couple months ago awesome job,2
also the missed free throw by steven adams to get the rebound and immediately know where westbrook was to pass it to him was amazing he knew exactly where he was and they were able to get a shot off from the miss before the other team even knew what happened lol,2
has one of the most incredible plays in golf ever commentators wow nice,2
never gets old the very definition of situational awareness,2
wow the accuracy to make that ball come back to him exactly where he needed off the rim is impressive tiny bit too low or high and it wouldn t have worked,1
that forward flip where he partially vaults off the other player is amazing even if you could practice for a thing like that itd still be hard to pull off,2
doesn t matter who we buy at this point once they re here they ll regress beyond recognition,0
i think casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing i don t believe he ll be unmotivated because he s won everything he s a world class cdm which we need but it s madness that we ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window crazy it reeks of absolute desperation,0
with the way things are going it will be marouane fellaine at pm on deadline day,1
quality player is casemiro also a dm which weve cried out for the concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at madrid we are said to pay him an eyepopping k a week is what ive heard thats typical united one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivated players who we then cant move on when its time as i say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial as for pulisic ive always been quite underwhelmed by him albeit you can see he does possess good quality i probably wouldnt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping rashford does anything productive every week,0
one question i have is will ten hag play casemiro when he joins united or will he stick to the greatest midfielders ever played football mctominay and fred,1
the reality is that when he was at ajax ten hag didnt choose the players at ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players at manchester united,2
we are a absolute mess if casemiro was the target why wasnt he signed months ago we just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man im not saying casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality its just man utds approach to signings is a joke plus im not overly keen on giving a year old a year contract at k a week but ill literally take anything over scott and fred,0
casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i can t bear to watch mctominay play again,2
if casemiro joins current man utd then it will be his beginning of the end of his career let he continue in madrid,1
united have big transfer problems right now literally everyone in football knows how bad the situation is at united and it means alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them haaland is a good example the players we can get the clubs they play for know how desperate we are and are naturally gonna jack up the price to get as money money as possible,0
west ham look terrible thus far graham potter is doing incredible things at brighton,0
someone forgot to tell west ham pl started earlier this season,1
brighton is the team people are actually sleeping ontheyre in a good standing at the moment but nobody is paying attention,0
dont sleep on brighton i would like to see them in europe one day,2
brighton looking good even though they lost couple good players,2
unfair because brighton and hove albion have two teams against west ham s one,1
west ham genuinely has a solid squad bad start to the season,1
kehrer was lucky the foul occurred on the line for a penalty otherwise hes likely sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity outside of the penalty area,1
moi and pervis and hopefully if sarmiento picks his level up i hope these three ecuadorian men play together they sure will do a high offensive playing style,2
brighton doing everything right very good team,2
probably the best game ive seen from harry maguire in a long time his absence from the game was pivotal in uniteds win,2
ten hag was on the pitch minutes before the warmup placing cones and balls in precise spots his body language was full of intensity and concentration he looked like a man on a mission,2
this is a good coach hes clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results this is the guy you want you to lead your team especially if they have been so illdisciplined like united has for the last few years if this was basketball he is the type of point guard you want hes got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion,2
as a liverpool fan i have to say that i admire how ten hag approached this game he is great to listen to honest and intelligent not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team respect,2
ten hag has found the best position for maguire not a single forward passed him not a single mis passed ball not a single foul not a single defensive error leading to goal keep it up maguire,2
so refreshing to have a manager whos not afraid to make big decisions,2
the tactical position of maguire was class,2
from my point of view the selection of varane is decisive when the defense lacks solidity all areas of the game suffer his presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team including martinez who was also much more efficient i wonder if in reality varane is not the man of the match even without being the best on the field sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little,1
i loved ten hags comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done he has total belief in himself it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too,2
so now the question becomes did they raise themselves just because it was liverpool or has ten hag become the first coach in a long time at that club to actually instill an attitude shift in his players,1
people are not talking about how much of an effect the altitude had on leon it s crazy bring that belt home rocky and defend it at wembley another w incoming mate,1
ive been down my whole life and now look at me now look at me now god those words tears are speaking,0
that look at me now gave me chills it really shows what he has been through to get there big congratulations,2
look at me now what an iconic speech the whole thing,2
the most amazing thing about this is how leon shone on the mic hes never been regarded as much of a talker but this might be best post fight interview ever its got it all cold one liners tear jerking passion a roaring crowd and bedlam in the stadium watched this so many times already,2
so many people said edwards didnt even deserve the shot most underrated most disrespected fighter in the sport casuals with opinions baffling look at him now leon edwards is the quintessential gray man dark horse he does not train at altitude and epo dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight the headkick was well read and calculated incredible,0
every time he says look at me now i feel it happy for him,2
leon has done the uk proud all the hurdles he s had in his career all the doubters and to silence everyone and beat the p p number was great to see,2
this has me hyped for work about to clock in and scream you s all thought i d be late look at me now congrats leon,2
the name rocky couldn t possibly be more fitting absolutely amazing win faced with such adversity,2
its amazing how arsenal is finally playing so well they dont have to rely on running the game though saka saliba jesus and zinchenko are also such a fresh injection to this team,2
can we get a second season of all or nothing with arsenal i would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes,2
xhaka as a player summarizes arsenals rebirth absolutely love that we kept him,2
tim howard just keeps getting better and better as a pundit wasn t impressed by him at first but he s slowly growing on me,2
for once in a very long time it feels great to be a gooner,2
the fans support of saliba is unreal going back to the own goal last week the whole fan base wants him to succeed he could have an amazing career,2
arteta finally getting some credibility if partley stays healthy and jesus keeps his form arsenal can challenge city for the title,2
the result is better than what was expected arsenal are performing better than anticipated the next actual challenge is villa not man u,2
arsenal haters you didnt beat anyone and it is only games into the season also arsenal haters last season you were beat by a championship team and have lost all your three games you are staring at relegation,0
such an awesome collection of cars for this year s car magazine sports car giant test but which is your favourite comment below,2
a collection of brilliant cars but i would go for the gt rs you cant beat a high revving normally aspirated engine,2
gt rs with the mclaren a very close second for mei simply believe the porshe is way more versatile and at the same time affordable too whilst putting the same smile on my face,2
great video guys this channel definitely deserves more subs than a lot of other car review channels its the gt rs for me here with the a close second,2
well done car magazine but i will take porsche state of art on wheels,2
wonderful group of cars i would have a tough time choosing between the lotus gt rs i thought the color combo on that ferrari was in poor taste it does not look good to my eyes,0
i feel like the doesn t belong in this list at all almost unfair,0
id love any of those with the exception of the lotus in this company it looks outclassed in every department for me the one that offers the best combination of performance desirability and of being obtainable would be the maserati,2
lt is on a different level to any of the others in practically every way,1
how gorgeous is the mc in comparison to the i love the rear of the but its just ugly from the front the mc with a mc livery would be my choice i think would need the opfs removed though to get some better sound out of it or the lotus and pay off my house p p,2

impossible not to love mitrovic he plays with so much passion,2
two teams with two classic cf players strong physical and dominant in the air great match premier league needs more strikers like mitrovic and toney,2
mitrovic just sores up on headers it s nearly unstoppable for smaller players,2
fulham could easily stay up along with forest,2
fulham doing what united couldnt,1
first goal for brentford was a masterpiece loved it mitrovic is a killer,2
everyone doubted fulham but they re looking favorites to stay up,2
ivan toneys mitro celebration probably a lil awkward now,0
as a spurs fan congrats fulham and i hope you play another priemer league next season to survive,2
mitrovic heads it with accuracy and pace like a shot with his foot,1
he s playing in goal for my team any day however many legs he s got i don t care i love this man,2
to be clear that basketball player did not intentionally bounce that basketball into the hoop he was trying to throw it at the opposing team in order for them to retain the ball by making the ball go out of bounds off i the other player,1
in volleyball only front row players can block back row players may jump but cannot touch the ball which makes jumping almost pointless the libero who is always in the back row cant even jump so the point stands only if the block was made by one of the front row players which i could not determine,1
that one legged goalie is teaching us more than any other video on youtube,2
the vasy clip was a normal game for him thats the big cat go bolts,2
that lag man absolutely legend hats off melt my heart,2
really awesome moments great video,2
we were doing backhans sweeps in waterpolo when i was in hs nothing spectacular other than we were strong,2
as per george carlin i believe that shot is worth points,2
the cyclist was incredible made me jump out of my seat,2
gabriel jesus has seriously fit into this squad like a glove two goals and two assist is amazing saka looked a bit quiet today but it s probably due to his fitness not being up to speed this early on zinchenko did good and marteneli fried fofona who looks like he s about ti go for millif we get another signing i ll be happy this team is looking very promising,2
love the start of this season so far arsenal need to keep their confidence up in order to take control over games and win them coyg,2
you can still see how saliba is solid even after the miscommunication mistake what a gem,2
the fans clapping for saliba after the own goal said it all for me the fans are behind this group great win the score line could ve been much higher coyg,2
gabriel jesus has been amazing for arsenal hes merged quickly into this arsenal side playing magnificently arsenal by the looks of it have a good season ahead of them,2
the chemistry and youth of this arsenal squad is crazy top four finish this year and if they improve even further then theyll definitely compete with city and liverpool next season,2
xhaka had a really good game criticize him when it s justified no doubt but you also have to praise him when he deserves it goal assist,2
gabriel jesus really showing pep that they didn t need to look for anyone better he s pure class at any club he goes to,2
will be interesting to see how far arsenal s defense will take them this year they have plenty of offense,2
i love how the arsenal fans applauded saliba when he scored an own knowinng that if that ball goes beyond him to vardy it is a goal best fans in the pl,2
as a mcdonalds cheeseburger i can confirm that this is exactly how were made,1
this is still more real than the actual mcdonald s burger,1
that looks delicious,2
thank you so much for this ive always wanted to make one of these,2
very basic instructions tasted incredible,2
as a mcdonalds worker i can confirm this is exactly how we make our cheeseburger,1
this is a great video more people should know about this wonderful recipe,2
this is my favorite meal it s too delicious that i needed to go to the doctor to check how to remove it from my stomach because tasted very delicious that my stomach didn t work well,2
thank you so much i can now make this anytime to eat delicious,2
this is better than our own recipe at mac donalds thanks,2
man dont you hate it when you get stuck on a deserted island end up clapping a fish woman only for the fish woman to suddenly choose to clap the only other guy on the island i know i do,0
i get knowing is half the battle but the other half is extreme violence,0
the humor logic and writing of nerd explains is just top tier easily the best of the how to beat youtube posters,2
i mean to be fair stomping on their hand when they try to make their presence known peacefully only to get shanked in the eye through a peephole a while later does indeed anger anyone not just smart fish people,0
actually if its currently september and he left days ago that would have been a week or two after arch duke franz ferdinand was assassinated and an englishman like friend wouldnt have known a fullblown world war was about to clack off since austriahungary wouldnt declare war until a few weeks until after he set sail,0
im still amazed that the dude somehow dodged a world war by fighting a fish army,2
the kid wasnt front line when friend went out walking he stumbled across the toads doing their normal thing foraging the kid was out learning toadette knew that friend wasnt a danger to fishkind the movie drop subtext hints that like starship troopers the monsters werent the random violent one gruner started it likely by killing somemany of them and fishnapping a female member of their tribe to use as his own personal fleshlight peace was plenty possible and friend figured it out he just wasnt very smart as shown in the rest of the video all he had to do was offer them gruner at least at that point even at the beginning of the movie were set to think hes going to be attacked when they come knocking on his door but thats the director using our bias and expectation in monster movies they were curious sure and maybe marking the territory but they werent attackoriented until after friend got antsy i wonder if the tadpole gruner killed was his own,1
this episode is so funny i love the script and how you delivered it giving me binge express vibes keep it up,2
correcting gods mistake one bullet at a time has to be some of the funniest narrating of all time keep up the great work always looking forward to the next post,2
needless to say this channel never dissapoints,1

hi kristen in your videos youve talked about grounding your furniture by using a large rug which looks great what if i have carpet is there anything i would need to incorporate to make the furniture appear grounded in this situation,2
i would love some tips to decorate a small but high ceiling living room its been a struggle to find inspiration,2

kristen youre like the only youtuber i constantly watch i feel like i connect with you in so many ways,2
confidence isn t i know they ll like me it s i m okay if they don t,1
hes right ive always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and i come across as confident most of the times to the point where people are surprised when i tell them i have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do its not about feeling perfect its about knowing you deserve to be where youre at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times,2
i think fake it till you make it is really important when it comes to confidence you need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally appearing confident even when you dont feel confident i believe can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim in some circumstances,2
anyone who has seen an infant stare at someone unselfconsciously or do almost anything that infants and pretoddlers do will understand that we are indeed born confident i think fear and inhibition are learned and later have to be unlearned if we are to regain our initial confidence now that we have an intellectual understanding of it,1
honestly i feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others like jane goodall or colin powell im a person that has a mission thats important to me plus huge experience and knowledge that built me and im proud and what the world thinks is not my concern,2
confidence can be very quiet finally someone said it thank you,2
i was born confident and as a little girl i was constantly scolded for being too bold or outspoken now i own it again and found joy in life like when i was true to myself,2
the presenter here delivers his knowledge succinctly he is the example of what he is teaching thank you for a concise no extraneous lesson it is has been immensely helpful,2
i have adhd so usually its hard for me to focus on talks speeches and so on but when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what theyre saying i tend to pay more and even full attention i paid full attention to this video and even remember what i learned after watching only once this is my nd time here just to make sure i dont forget,2
to me confidence means being happy with who you are having that inner peace with the person you are,2
this guys body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information,0
he s definitely someone who can make you admit everything just by his personality,2
an important caveat is that when interviewing anyone you need to establish a baseline for their individual body language maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation so you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react watch how they move when they tell the truth figure out their normal then you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation you are looking for clusters of indicators not isolated indicators,1
im glad that those signs he laid out at the beginning were myths ive put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so i dont come across as untrustworthy and when i do them by accident i always felt like im somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it this puts my mind at ease selfsoothing if you will,2
love that he first mentioned crossing arms and looking away i cross my arms often to relieve anxiety and i usually tend to look away when being explained something because im visually processing information they tell me,1
god his children must ve had such a hard time lying to him,0
the guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person they know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits and most importantly none of this can be used too convict you they cant just say yep hes the murderer he is lying and throw you in prison it is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too or who they should focus on they still need to investigate and find actual proofv to convict you if you didnt do it they cant convict you just because you seemed like you were lying,0
i remember i was in an argument with a friend if mine and i crossed my arms she instantly called me out on it and said if im being open and honest then why did i cross my arms thats a defensive stance later i found out that this was meant and a self sooth which i find more realistic that situation was stressful for me so crossing my arms made sense i do that when im anxious or upset,1
this is the most interesting thing ive seen in a long time i can feel this guys passion and attention to detail the way he described seeing pertinent nonverbals jumping out at you as if a caricature when played at double speed was incredibly perceptive im so intensely interested in this individual and his affinity to human behavior,2
my dad was a drill sargent in the army he had the ability to read peoples behavior like thisit was unnerving to have him explain my behavior to me,0
i m honestly starting to get the impression that being a french woman means putting of your energy into being the sexiest woman in the room but then pretending you don t try at all,0
french way go to the gym and tell no one american way wear gym gear all day and tell everyone how you have to work out today but never actually go,1
alexa chung pretending shes not incredibly stylish for minutes,1
i lived years in paris and i used to observe a lot in the metro their outfit i noticed that blue beige and grey were the colors most used to dress no patterns only simple color so simple and stylish at the same time it is the opposite of us italians we like be noticed by accessories or colors i prefer the french style,2
i love what camielle said about french girls finding what suits them their body and what they like and dressing according to that not following trends but buying staple pieces that will fit your wardrobe and last a long time i really love that fast fashion has ruined our sense of style some people only buy a piece because its trendy then the trend passes and they forget about that item and throw it out and the cycle continues with the next trend,2
it s nice to have a bag that doesn t scream designer well i have a wardrobe full of clothes that don t even whisper designer y all it makes me so happy that i made you laugh,2
i bet a lot of french people are rolling their eyes at this,0
i love how they are like actual friends talking over each other interrupting each other not listening the little laughs i love it,2
shes so on point with french styles they dont follow trends but stay to the classics with some accents of edginess or accents of new trends but the root is classic and simple,2
this girl really has an aussie feel to me funny that she s britishfrench which you can see in ways but so much of her reminds me of my australian friends,2
stop being selfish audience first it is not about you but about your audience cut length people wont pay attention for a long time grab me what is the one thing you want me to remember no matter what you communicate make sure you bring across your most important point keep it simple one sentenceparagraph is better than two use simple sentence structure use simple words be human write like a human dont try to be a harvard professor bring your point across like you are talking to someone at the bar just stop use as few words and sentences as possible there you go this would not have needed minutes,1
always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis i dont care about bullish or bearish market trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over btc when i started at btc in just few weeks implementing richard and tips,2
this was a fantastic talk its a topic we are all somewhat aware of but we need to dive deeper like this individual thank you sir,2
very well put i love how ted talks are short but convey meaningful messages,2
true in college i wrote a page term paper and in error turned in the draft with a bunch of typos grammer errors run on sentences spelling errors etc the first couple paragraphs were fine so when it got retuned it was graded a with a good work handwritten by the professor obviously and luckily for me he didnt bother reading past the first sentence,2
this was great i am a freelance content writer and ive been implementing these strategies from the beginning because its very true great talk,2
nicholas carr described this scanning vs deep reading phenomenon in great detail in his book the shallows what the internet is doing to our brains and is worth a read for anyone with further interest and he provides provocative evidence it changes the mechanism our brain uses to process and store information,2
i always tell my wife its not about how you feel its about how the other person understands what you gonna say and for god sake keep it short but clear,1
that hit home im so guilty of spending hours writinganswering emails etc with what i would think makes me sound strong intelligent and a force to be respected and would read them back to myself countless times to see how good l lookedl loved this talk and will totally change now kiss keep it simple stupid,2
being succinct is great now how long will it take for you to learn that people dont appreciate being mislead or flat out lied to do another ted talk when you figure that part out side note youve known this information for a long time this is why the most important information is buried at the bottom the media uses it to their advantage which is why in most cases the first half tends to be pointless and boring or aimed at narrative people stop paying attention so never get to the actual information,0
i dont have time it is not a priority time is elastic time is a choice totally agreed thank you so much for the talk,2
this is hands down one of best talks i have heard thanks for such a wonderful lesson,2
well i have finished watching it and i found it really useful here are some lessons i learnt i dont have time it is not a priority time is a choice it is elastic we have enough time almost all of us make the experiences enjoyable such as you can read or listen to a book while commuting get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis focus on what matters and you will build the live you want,2
make yourself a threecategory priority list for the coming week career relationships self and there should be items in each category small moments can have great power you can use your bits of time for bits of joy even if we are busy we have time for what matters quoting her,2
we are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments but on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and thats what laura vanderkam says in her talk i used to rush myself on the bike to school and i love cycling but i wanted to be there as fast as possible so that id have more time to study yet every time i would rush through id be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me making me feel frustrated with the time i was wasting waiting at the red lights all i was left with was more sweat frustration and muscle pain so i decided this was not going to do it now i cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature the rain the sunshine the wind the smells of life everything listening to the city or the birds i even have time to stop if i see a cat and try to give it some snacks i arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day its my favorite thing to do now making a priority list will make your life better especially the relationships and self categories taking time to just be present in the moment and live ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through facebook watch a ted talk you wont feel like youve wasted your time after that thanks for the inspiring talk im getting back to work now time to review my priority list,1
we dont build the lives we want by saving time we build the lives we want and time saves itself,2
ive had varying work schedules and it was incredibly hard to adjust to night shifts at first mainly because it was hard to find time to hang out with friends and family this video has taught me that priorities can change they might take some getting used to but it showed me that a night job doesnt have to mean no social life,1
every minute i spend is my choice how great is this sentence,2
i like her approach and its partly right but i do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we dont count them as priorities for example its not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at the opportunities for doing certain things are less kids are in bed shops are closed etc also when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and its not super easy to happen,1
i love this womans attitude shes funny captivating and interesting too for me step of controlling my time would be to stop watching youtube though,2
i know at least ways to deal with them never take their words personally always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you dont compete with them it is futile and drains your energy if they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment the odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative dont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behind your back speak to their face always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that do not trust them dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you keep your distance and value your boundaries protect yourself,0
you will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you true power is sitting back and observing things with logic true power is restraint if words control you that means everyone else can control you breathe and allow things to pass,1
repeat after me its safe to set boundaries with difficult people no matter what they say or feel i am safe,2
this only works if all people involved are reasonable if one or more parties cant be reasoned with then the problem continues you can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall,0
their bad behavior shouldnt be the cause of your heartattack brilliant,0
long story short keep the convo brief simple cool calm and level headed only give one word answers than a full sentence don t give them the benefit of the doubt be the bigger person and do yourself a favour and save yourself from that heartache trust me when i say this it works every time giving them a reason to whine and complain and talk about said drama only repeats itself if you give them the time and energy to do it when they get less of that well the difficulty becomes easier to manage,1
cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level people who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them money unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded they have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem best solution is to remove yourself from that environment,0
i swear i need this to deal with my whole family,1
this puts a whole new perspective on the way i think about others actions and my reactions i cant change people but i can change the way i think and feel and also asking questions is another good point very well said,2
heart attack beautifully explained and to the point it s after all your life which matters and someone s behaviour should not make you suffer,1
whether you re just launching your adult life or finally giving yourself permission to question assumptions about adulthood learn practical strategies to build a future that fits you from julie lythcotthaims enroll in her ted course how to become be your best adult self today,2
how to raise a successful kid without over parenting make sure they understand that life isnt about high grades and a big bank account make sure they understand to grow up kind and compassionate happy and making others happy,2
my mother used my successes as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity it was never enough for her to show love only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that i was a complete failure take it from me don t push your children towards your goals it only teaches them that they aren t good enough to make it on their own i was successful in school and was the first in my family to get a degree but i was also the most miserable sad child of all of us kids is that success i know it isn t,0
we are imperfect people trying to raise perfect children go figure,0
lol i m and i m already trying to figure out how to raise my future kids correctlyi just see a lot of my friends suffering because of their parents and i m like nope not gonna be me i plan on collecting knowledge throughout my teenage years so when the time comes i ll hopefully be a good mom,1
im crying so hard my heart aches because i feel the pressures of the children from narcissistic parents who control their children too much and destroy their self confidence this speech is a breakthrough thank you i love this,2
my parents used to be like that then when i got into the perfecte degree in the perfect college i had a breakdown that left me bedridden for a whole year they realized what had happened and now they are being absolutely amazing understanding and encouragingbutnotoverbearing parents to my little brother and to me as well i love them so much and i respect and admire them so much for havig the courage of admitting their own shortcomings and to truly rethink their parenting style to become better for their kids,2
l honestly think that we adults are victims of bad parenting whats worse is that we are repeating history on our offspring,0
the best parenting talk ive heard about parenting and the vital importance of having kids to do chores,2
my father who passed away in august th taught me to do chores at home laundry dishwashing cooking house cleaning taking care of my younger brothers now my wife is so happy she married me because i do our own chores without complaining thanks pops miss you,2
have a damn good day,2
pro tip dont enter a death game called die now,0
you know the main character is smart when there arent that many comments on what he couldve done differently for each challenge after the first one the concept of this series seems interesting i hope theres more someone give this boyfriend an award for loyalty anyone who is willing to play a multidimensional physicsbreaking deadly game for their partner is beyond marriage material,2
yes i love these death game videos i hadnt even heard of some of these shows or movies until i found your channel thanks for introducing them to a wider audience,2
well if he ever was in a relationship at least he s honest he s not climbing into any portal to save you,1
death game master there is chance that you will die cinema summary i like those odds,1
wouldn t it be epic if cinema summary made his own death game,1
i would like to argue that declaring you quit the death game and that the girlfriend can save herself is perhaps the worst way to test the game master in that situation yes figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea but if the only reason theyre helping you is because theyre impressed with your selflessnesswillingness to risk your life to save hersthey have a connection to the girlfriend then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game im not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declarationaction but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own motivations to see if that has any effect but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you,1
person does literally anything cinema summary that was their biggest mistake,0
cinema summary is no disappointment and always has something for everyonethanks for the amazing content,2

the thief is so smart in this game it was almost like cinema summary was guiding him throughout this entire death game,2
i love how in the triangle room game instead of just ignoring the dumbest person in the room they used his imagination and creativity to figure out the solution,2
for the platform game just have each person make a prolonged sound while slowly going and laying down on the platform that way you can easily tell if there s a wall between you and them by whether the sound changes,1
im pretty sure that wouldnt be enough to destroy his plan if lets say one of the three people with the wall managed to answer the question correctly thats still options eliminated and with how fast shirube came up with his first plan he had more than enough time to devise a second test to figure which of the remaining two directions was the correct one,1
for the platform game i think the second go was almost perfect if he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question then it would ve been foolproof like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person then asked everyone which hand held the coin that s not a perfect solution but that s the kind of question i m thinking of one where if you choose an obvious answer you know they re lying and the only one telling the truth would give you a third answer,1
in the platform game what if the guy asked the other people to go to the corner of the edge of the platform and reach their hand out so he can grab it since theres only a small opening in the center they wouldnt be able to do it and the distance seems to be close enough for this to work,1
this guy s definetly a genius,2
for the spinning platform i have an easier solution once you see which way is safe to jump and they put the mask on put your hand on one of the corners of the platform while facing the safe area now when the platform rotates count how many turns it has made by feeling with your free hand the position of your hand on the corner being able to count how many rotations made gives you the idea of where you are and where to jump,1
as for the spinning jump game the voices from the people behind the wall will have less compare to the voice without the wall with that alone it will be very easy to figure out,1
summary try obtain a consistent hours sleep time per day try match your schedule with your circadian rhythm dont force yourself to wake up early or stay up late use a melodic alarm dont snooze at all physical exersice exposure to bright natural light during daytime hydrate yourself contain caffeine intake preferably avoid caffeine intake hours before bedtime eat healthily avoid eating before bedtime regular exercise though avoid it before bedtime napping before pm preferably with length of a complete sleep cycle m warm shower before bedtime avoid alcohol after evening sleep in a dark cool environment put away gadgets from bed dont lie awake get up to do something and relax yourself dont check time when youre awake midsleep develop a healthy consistent sleep schedule value yourself dont ignore your health or mental issue seek professional help if you need to,1
the best thing i started doing to wake up is to leave my phone on my desk across the room so i cant be on my phone before bed and i have to stand up to turn off my alarm just forcing myself to stand up in the morning stops me from snoozing my alarm,2
just so you know im from brazil and this video saved me thank you finally the algorithm got the recommendation right,2
i was constantly exhausted no matter how much i ate or slept it was affecting my job my workouts at the gym even my free time i felt terrible like i was sick or something i finally went to the doctor and found out i had an iron deficiency so my doctor put me on supplements and offered me an infusion and i feel so much better so its definitely worth getting bloodwork done and going to the doctors on top of all these great tips,2
my thing has been the shifting of schedules to match my chronotype just the violence of waking up at h was unbearable for me and when i went to college and picked classes that started at at the earliest it was a game changer i am not sleeping more hours maybe less hours even because college but i am never truly tired anymore,0
the early bird and night owl thing totally makes sense people would have to take turns defending the tribe so different sleep schedules makes sense,1
i m a nurse i work night shift but even working nights following these tips is so important for me some people think i m crazy for staying on a night schedule even on my days off but it s like you said it s so hard on your body to not just stay on one schedule my blackout curtains sleep mask extended release melatonin are my best friends after a shift a hot shower,2
there was one single semester in undergrad that i was able to set my schedule up so that everyday i had a class start at a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by and my dorm happened to be a single with a lot of windows and natural light having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep i ever felt it was also the most consistent i ve ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports followed by a semester where classes started at either or pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mentalhealth wise,2
i have ptsd and clinical depression so i always feel tired ive been subjected to things i wouldnt wish on anyone and even that was way easier than trying to get out of bed is for me now please take care of yourselves treatment for depression is very effective dont worry about potential side effects because one very common side effect of depression is that you pass away,0
great advice all of it im one of those you mentioned near then end with a medical condition sleep isnt rejuvenating for some no matter how much we get working towards good sleep habits is still helpful as it regulates our lives and helps us pace what minimal energy we have so if youre reading this comment no matter if youre chronically ill like i am or just a tired person without a debilitating illness practice good sleep habits be patient itll help,2

i am almost at my th hour of watching tedx talks and i have to say i am getting pretty good at this,2
,1
this is correct looking back on every skill ive learned and accounted my hours for it is around the hour range that i feel i got the hang of this and that the dream isnt foolish but by practice and repetition the perception becomes reality,2
the main barrier is not intellectual its emotional was taken to heart thanks for the video,2
is the life changing quote for me trying to be a perfectionist at everything and eventually procrastinating is the thing that im doing over these years thank you,2
i really believe in everything he has just said it is important to avoid procrastination guys i am telling you this because of my life experience i moved to canada when i was years old and my life has changed completely i was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my rd year when my mother took the decision to move to canada it was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture my knowledge about english was probably between and so i had to invest part of time studying english i proposed to myself that i had to learn the language at a university level in year and it worked i still need improvements but i feel really proud of myself because i was able to learn the language after having learned english i applied to university of toronto to study computer science and since the semester was going to start on september of the following year i took that year to study everything about my career i took my time to study advanced functions calculus physics and programming what do i mean about all of this you can learn everything you want if you really want to the crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it i personally do not believe in what the science says about the special kids we all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want you can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort i hope you have a great day and i wish you all the best never give up,1
what i learned is we need to be able to deconstruct the skill and learn enough to self assess our progress eliminating diseraction while practice time and put our hours this was so excellent,2
the best most exciting most practical most fascinating ted talk that i continue to come back to you again and again read the book multiple times applied it to everything from learning a new language to fixing up my house to now developing my skills as a ham radio operator thank you so much for this,2
this makes learning something more digestible instead of getting overwhelmed by the task so right wish i watched this earlier in my life,2
love it put hours practice in it and have fun thinking about my karate journey hrs weeks here i am feeling much more comfortable compared the stressful emotion at the middle now the next learning is about c programming for a r module problem love the idea of selfcorrection milestone and the dedication of hours practice my comment about the hours is that its just the practice time it doesnt include also very important things the preparation time the decomposing time and the reflection time,2

i know you dont read your comments gordon however ive just practiced making rice and it turned out better than anticipated g of rice and ml of cold water and i followed the method you described you did say to minutes and i gave it the result was extremely satisfactory and i combined it with some leftovers and have had a lunch with no waste i know how to do the onion as my daughter has already shown me im off out shortly to buy a steel as i usually sharpen my knife on a whetstone which can be more of a chore than using a steel im and everyday is a schoolday ive so wanted to master rice cheers,2

love your honesty i started a blog in college too roll tide but that was i was never really consistent until now your videos helped me realize how important consistency is,2
thank you so much for sharing all of your tips and tricks you are seriously such an inspiration i am currently trying to start my own blog and it is harder than i thought it would be to juggle school work and starting a blog i am so grateful for your content and everything that you share,2
sophia you are such an inspiration thank you for being radically honest and giving tips that are actually very helpful ive been binging your content and plan on building a blog this year cheers to lets get this bread,2
one of my favorite video series please keep them coming youre such an inspiration to a lot of people im in the middle of starting and restarting my blog social media presence my biggest downfall is consistency but hopefully now that my little one is in school ill have more time thank you again love love love your blog and videos they truly motivate me,2
watching your videos feels like taking a great course in itself thanks sophia,2
you are right about pinterest i have k monthly visitors and only now starting a blog and looking for advice and i agree about the classes and also learning from others are are already successful and implementing their strategies to your blog well done i wish i had had the capability to start a blog when i was in college s girl ty sophia beautiful presentation easy to understand your points are well made,2
love love your courses btw i highly recommend anyone to do it if you are on the fence about it this is our year babes ps sophia i d love to see more videos about your design biz,2
the most genuine and real advice about blogging i have found seriously so encouraging and straightforward,2
if you do not mind me asking what was your major in college and did it help you towards your progress in bloggingbusiness,1
believing that no matter what happens you re going to be fine anyway is always a great mindset to have,2
youll stop worrying that someone will reject you because youll never reject yourself that is brilliant well done,2
relaxed body language selective eye contact nonreactivenesssilencepatient response framing the situation no matter what you will be okay dont try to convince other people willing to walk away,1
realizing that no matter what happens ill be okay is exactly how i survived my childhood i used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists i realized if i survived all that i will survive whatever else comes my way and thats when i stopped stressing as much i hadnt really connected it with confidence before but i can see the connection now interesting,2
i feel like a big part of dons character is that even he has his own issues with selfconfidence but he never lets people see that when he does thats when we start to see the layers peel back and dons true self starts to show its really all about how you project yourself to the world and those around you,1
practice keeping your word everyday you ll really gain confidence every time you say you re gonna do something and don t do it your selfesteem diminishes no matter how meaningless the task may seem take your word very serious,1
one thing this video misses and probably the one most important thing is that confidence comes from within you can stand in any way you want dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king solomon blush but if inside you re still insecure the world will see it love yourself know you re worthy and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside don t try and be or imitate someone else be who you are and love it one thing this video gets right know you re gonna be ok no matter what nough said love to you all xxx,2
you reach true confidence by letting everything go,2
if you spend time getting to know yourself and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life the one you have with yourself if that relationship is solid then you always have an inner safe haven no matter what is going on around you that self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation that is the deepest form of confidence,2
this is the most incredibleunderstandable video on confidence ive came across by far keep it up honestly,2
this could not have come at a better time im literally building my first pc this week,2
ive wanted to build a pc all my life but been too scared of breaking something to try this week that ended with my first successful build big thanks to this video,2
i have been building custom computers for years and i still found several things in this build guide that i did not know nice job ltt,2
ive also been building computers for about years the main reason why these videos are the paramount of pc builders is because he and his friends are entertaining as well as informative i am always learning to be a leader one needs a team and one person cant do it all good jobs guys,2
just a reminder for older motherboards or costcut motherboards if you have a cpu with igpu or onboard graphics solution even if you have a graphics card there is a good chance that it will default to the motherboards graphics solution first and you will need to configure the bios to use the external graphics for preboot display this has become less common but is still important to remember,1
this is peak ltt i can imagine how proud the team is putting this together,2
ive built plenty of pcs over the years im not necessarily the target demogrpahic for this but my goodness this is a fantastic video i learned plenty in here despite my experience great job guys,2
ok wow this was extremely helpful im still just in the planningsaving up stage for building my own pc and this whole video was so insightful and made me excited to get started thanks guys,2
see people appreciate the work that goes into creation of such high quality videos thats what makes you guys stand out so much,2
as someone with exactly zero experience with building computers this was invaluable i followed along step by step and actually built a working budget gaming rig thank you all so much for this video,2
this is very valuable advice it s easy to overthink and completely lose track of your end goal this can be detrimental to your future thanks ali,0
future wife were going to have a how to have a productive bachelor partywedding series soon so true that social threats get us all wound up viewing things as an experiment takes off a lot of pressure because youre focusing more on the process than the end result i like that mental board of advisors thinking great video ali,2
thanks for the excellent tips ali what is overthinking thinking in terms of experiments thinking in terms of expected value fear is your compass the foundation of consistent action mental board advisors mba,2
the best way to stop overthinking is understanding that no amount of overthinking will lead to positive results in fact all it will do is cause more stress and anxiety for yourself more likely leading to the problem only getting worse,0
you cant give up now its just a season whatever you are going through no matter how hard it is it will pass better days are coming ahead,2
i ve been an overthinker my whole life too so it s really cool to see someone i look up to discuss this and explain how to move through it i ve been talking myself through these moments of paralysis but these tips seem much more helpful so thank you i ll give them a try,2
think in terms of experiment think in terms of expected value fear is your compass foundation of consistent action mental board of advisors,1
perfection is the enemy of process hope this quote makes sense i didnt think too much before typing it,1
i can t even imagine you being an overthinker because of how chilled you are vs me being super neurotic and overthinking everything so it s good to hear you talk about this also future wife that is so cute,2
hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it so shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating when we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention so just listening to what our body is saying acknowledging the feelings and fears can be very clarifying and soothing,1

ann im and when i was little my mom would take me to the public library there was a wonderful woman that would read stories to the children and give the adults time to find what they needed she would read fantasy books with dragons and fairies it was such an amazingly positive time in my life you sound just like her and when you are making something or saving something you give me that same feeling of wonder and joy watching you work your magic this is one of the best channels on all of youtube thank you ann for everything you do,2
this series gives me confidence that theres always a way for you to mess up and theres always a way for you to make it better so be hopeful everyone and thank you ann,2
one of my favorite cakes my mother ever made started out as a near fail it was a cheesecake that had cracked down the middle we had blueberries growing in our yard so she took a bunch that wed already picked cooked them down into a thick jelly and poured it into the crack as i recall she called it grand canyon blueberry cheesecake,2
the pool cake was so cute put an appropriate toy depending on what character your child is currently obsessed with im and i would still absolutely love to get a cake like that,2
as soon as hyper realistic cakes came up my first thought was sideserf i love that you made sure to point out that she has problems with her videos being stolen and uncredited to spread the word to new audiences its why she uses the fluorescent green icing now i love watching all your content but it just mesmerises me when you bake,2
just woke up at am nothing like an upload from ann to start off our fridays the effort you put into every single video you make is just chefs kiss easily the most informative and creative baking channel i know and it goes so far beyond that as youve shown time and time again,2
the transformation of these cakes are mind blowing,2
ann im so glad you stepped in to be the aussie mum the world needed have you ever thought about doing an episode on traditional australian bakes like lamingtons anzac biscuits pavlovas etc theyre good recipes for new bakers also maybe find an old cwa cookbook and follow the recipes especially when australia still had rations,2
imagine being ann s friend that s already a treat i couldn t imagine being sick and her being her amazing self by delivering a delicious cake to mei hope your friend is feeling better,2
i love the rescue videos especially because ann tells us how to avoid the fail in the first place and then also shows us how to fix it,2
i wanna learn more magic,2
,1
me han abierto mi comprensi n y entendimiento gracias,1
amazing i will surely try of them,2
mind blowing magician got talent,2
very great moves,2
i like the one with the egg i want to do it said my daughtershe was fascinated by itwe let her do it once we got some vinegar,2
wow i realy like your tricks,2
wow such good easy trick thank you for teaching me i love it wow,2
i did that fingereating one and got my little bro with it i laughed so hard i almost ran out of air to breathe great vid d,2
the movie explains how to kill him you need to make him be afraid you what ever he turns into you need to face that fear and fight back once pennywise realises that you arent scared he will begin to starve because he feeds off of fear once he starves and is weakened you can finish him off for good,0
laughter defeats fear it would have made more sense in the remake if instead of bullying and insulting it they start laughing at how silly and not frightening the clown really is without any fear it gets weaker and weaker until it finally shrinks down to the bug it truly is,0
so im watching this for nostalgia reasons i still love this series,2
the reason why pennywise said fear when he was defeated is not because he will spread more of it its because he is feeling fear and he let go for reasons so he can go down to his lair and because hes in shock,0
this is one of the horror movies that i watched and actually almost didn t go to sleep,1
im not entirely sure of how i stumbled upon this channel but as an avid hunter of moviecomic book lore this channel is absolutely amazing kya is such a legend the level of passion she demonstrates in these videos is real and her narration is superb i am very thankful for the fact that this channel even exists liked and subscribed,2
the dark tower book series was awesome it tied together a lot of loose ends from the stand it and many other stephen king novels just too bad the movie wasnt that great,2
so he s basically me when i wake up from my year nap and craving a baby ruth,1
this came out before the new halloween where michael myers essentially levels up to the status of god or force of nature,1

great video i wrote many down and will use them thanks very much,2
housekeeper here i really thought these were going to be ridiculous but a lot of them are actually pretty good tips some of them are a little extra like don t go to the trouble of blending up dried grapefruit peel and mixing it with baking soda just make a paste with baking soda lemon juice and white vinegar also i don t think flying round while mopping the floors is a hack maybe just take off your shoes,2
can someone tell me why they never list the quantities of the ingredients or how long to let things sit for,0
nice useful video thanks,2
wow soy super fan de este canal,2
these are really great ideas please continue these unlike your silly ones recently thank you and god bless you,2
she s a natural this was a great ted talk truly worth every minute,2
their wins have nothing to do with my worthiness bevy smith,1
i am and finally realizing that i have to invest in my self and mental health or else it will be my demise i have made drastic changes and by sticking to them and not feeling guilty i am definitely looking and feeling better,2
if you dream regardless of age you will continue to be young,2
at a time where we re being told especially as women that you don t matter after and you should live for a man or your childrenthis conversation is so necessary well done bevy,2
i m in a transitional phase of my life at and bevy s talk was just what i needed,2
in the most perfect timing this came to me i am certainly at a point in my life where i m choosing me i m rediscovering what i love and advocating for myself and making choices without regret it s liberating and as always a journey of unknowns but i am certain that i will live my life and not be miserable,2
i m in a transitional point in life at as i discover what i m most passionate about what s next for me bevy s talk was inspiring and right on time cheers to it gets greater later,2
loved this talk who am i at my core how am i being perceived how do i love to be perceived,2
it s so inspiring yet very entertaining i feel i needed to watch this i m only yo but i ve felt like my life is about to end because i haven t had many chances but lately i ve realized i need some inner healing and know myself better and i ve been in that pathway since last year gonna put those questions in practice to not forget who i m looking for myself,2
i m also super sorry but i almost popped my left eardrum laughing so hard and fell of my bed almost when she said smooth as a baby s butt lmaooooo but anyways awesome,2
you guys have the best video ever,2
the girl who had a forest under her arms was really enjoying that dance,2
i m sorry but i bursted out laughing when her hat got snatched off lmaoo anyways great video,2
you know she can just pour the coke in the bottle right she doesn t have to put the top on the coke this is just my opinion though,1
the grandma voice is so funny got me dying on the floor,2
that party would be over already before you could even melt the candy,0
thank you so mush for the advice i tried all of your hacks and they actually worked well anyways thank for the advice,2
hey me and my little cousin have been watching u for years now and we rlly hope u notice,2
love it but my brother hates it,0
this has been one of your best videos yet dude keep up the great work,2
ddoi is such an educational channel without him humans would never grow thumbs,2
honey pot ants are also delicious or so im told the extraction of those cactus peppers is downright horrifying in the trypophobic sense yet i am still curious as to how they taste,0
the way that kid toss the chalk away when he finished writing is golden also a dragon fruit is the fruit of a cactus plant prickly pear is also another delicious one,2
wife how many fingers will you use dad ill only use my thumb thumb,1
the duck going for a swim and the service dog pushing the wheelchair are the cutest things ive seen all day,2
for those wondering the way how honey pot ants get their abdomens so big with fluids it done by feeding a freshly emerged adult ant tons of food while their exoskeleton is still soft this allows the gaster to stretch bigger than normal leading to how the ants become so plump they do this because if a shortage of food comes the other ants can get it from the ants that store it in their large abdomens called repletes it really is fascinating thing to see happen,2
as the pinned comment already said i think this was one of your coolest videos it had a lot of weird but cool and fascinating clips i really enjoy watching your content,2
the fruit from the cactus is actually pretty decent it s been a few years since i ve last tried it but sometimes it can be kinda tangy if i remember correctly,2
ddoi never fails to impress me keep up the great work,2
in the words of the late alan watts the meaning of life is just to be alive it is so plain and so obvious and so simple and yet everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves,1
in this day and age my life has become complicated especially my social and digital life i always wondered how to simplify it somehow thank you for making this video,2
very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking marcus aurelius meditations,2
the biggest thing ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend so you never really feel like you have enough thats why i really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have this is especially true of us in the first world we get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream but the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles and if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach the irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most they have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need so when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money but the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live you never feel like you have enough,2
perfect video as always ez in todays day age every person needs to remove excess baggage from ones life and embrace the idea of simplification both sense and simplicity are the two most significant aspects of our lives,2
excellent been minimizing for decades now the world is always perfect it is the mind that tries to make it not so,1
i just love how this video is an amalgamation of all the past videos you have produce so far thanks again for this wonderful food for the thought eizelg nger,2
thank you einzelganger for these mentally nutritious videos that you make for us to feed our minds peace,2
good summary when i crave something i imagine as realistically as possible that i already have it this helps me know if i really want it,2
that last point is really true its not about simplifying all aspects of life just for its own sake rather the point is for a more tranquil life thanks for the video,2
i love your channel the technical details are perfect i m an engineer and i work with batteries as a hobby there are two kinds of batteries that are lion one is protected and the other is unprotected the protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current the unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection guess which people choose for their vaping lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density they are damaged by over charging and over discharging cheap chargers don t behave and will over charge few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge so why don t people use protected cells generally those have too low current to make vaping possible the current draw to instantly heat to c is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly,2
crazy how this series went from kinda lightheartedly debunking ice cream icing and coke watermelon lifehacks to discussing about actually lifethreatening stuff thank you ann youre doing amazing work,2
they used to kind of have a can i trust this feature it was called the dislike count not that this ever stopped minute crafts,1
ive been vaping on and off for years having my honorary internet mom sound slightly disappointed in me made me throw everything out and i havent touched anything since this video came out its been rough but thank you for making me take the first step in getting healthier,1
they removed the trust verification by removing the dislike number from being seen yes i get all the arguments of why they did it but people can watch a video to see if the dislike ratio is justified and read the comments to why the dislike was made its sort of like reading reviews on a product you are purchasing,0
i remember when vaping was purely prescribed to recovering smokers years ago my friends mother had a vape that looked exactly like a cigarette and was recommended to her by a proffesional now i see middle schoolers sharing them in the parking lot of the school,0
there needs to be a trust rating the dislike button that got removed to protect smaller creators,1
making a separate comment for this one thing you didnt mention in the exploding vape part of the video is counterfeit batteries you mentioned faulty batteries poorly designed vapes but i think this is a big one that should not be left out most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands however theres a huge problem of cheap counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name even on places like amazon amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many peoples eyes,0
a shame how quickly vapes went from a better alternative to cigarettes to public heath hazard and under scrutiny,0
i remember in grade we did a reading comprehension about how ecigarettes are supposed to be a healthy alternative to smoking and then in grade we did another reading comprehension about how harmful it could be in two years science was able to learn enough to completely change their position about vaping ecigarettes,1
pov when people wants the face but they dont have enough robux,0
thank you for the face,2
i knew already some youtubers i used to watch had them on,1
keep up the good work idatchy,2
how do you do the profile thing is it available on tablet ipad phone,1
the tutorial for the emote on the profile was complicated for my brain i really want it tho,0
yayyy ty,2
a hidden face thats should be a secret right,1
cool,2
omg best video ever ty idatchy,2
it looks weird to me to have the whites be so smooth and perfect this method seems to preserve the whites the best although it requires more water and vinegar than other techniques ive been using alton browns technique and it works better than the classic vortex method but this one looks even easier,2
ooh outsciencing heston cant wait to give this a go for lunch tomorrow i really like the concept and how practical it is for preparing large numbers of eggs,2
great tip ive added vinager to the poaching water and when doing multiple eggs used rings to hold the individual eggs in place which can shape them kind of ugly into rounds compared to yours ive used small tuna tins that i cut the top and bottom off of for this pre soaking in vinager is much smarter too,2
i already am comfortable poaching an egg i even own egg laying chickens but i am so happy and excited to try this method you are absolutely right i have seen tons of poaching videos and this is a unique technique,2
so wonderful cant wait to try some perfect poached eggs soon,2
ill remember this for the next time i host brunch for a large group there are tons of great tips in here to help get a lot of eggs on the table at the same time if youre only making three or four eggs this method seems like overkill i add a few tablespoons of vinegar to the simmering water and crack one egg at a time into a ramekin so that i can very gently add it to the water as long as the eggs are fresh it works every time,2
incredible method after years as a chef i thought i tried every way possible to poach eggs and this one is by far the best tried it this morning it works flawlessly thanks for this tip,2
seriously most useful video ive watched in a long time,2
i can confidently poach one egg at a time using the vortex method but this is blowing my mind for poaching multiple eggs at once,0
i learned this very trick from a fantastic french chef early on in my cooking career and it is a game changer for poached eggs,2
if building a second brain sounds interesting to you and youd like to know more you can buy tiagos book on amazon here or take it further and join tiagos building a second brain course,2
this is one of the very best recaps of the building a second brain method ali fantastic job to you and your team it was so much fun collaborating together and i hope we do it again,2
to summarize the code for building the nd brain c capture use notetaking apps or picture to store information o organise ask where will i use this information d distill progressive summarization e express show your work,1
summary notes intro the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information the second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information the second brain system has helped ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well the second brain system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations capture organize distill express what is a second brain and why should you have one a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information the methodology for building a second brain has four parts capture organize distill and express code c capture ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done the system has also helped with his teaching work he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information,2
i am eagerly waiting for alis first ted talk it would be amazing i wonder what topic he will speak on,2
having a second brain is no joke i am currently using notion to perfect this great video ali definetly devouring all of the information you are putting out,2
now this is my favourite video i have been struggling a lot when it comes to handling multiple projects thanks ali you really answered a lot of my questions today,2
im so happy about this book im reading it right now am on page and its already changing my digital life thank you tiago forte,2
thanks for this ali and team it really helps break down the process of thinking to have a nd brain ive been calmer with my projects since listening to you and i grow ever more productive with my schedule and life in general as for the video idea perhaps you can make a video on how to deal with burn outs i believe burnouts burn creativity you want to push but you just mentally cant ive dealt with it in the past but im getting out of it now since the company i want to work for actually hit me up to work with them it gave me a boost,2
your book club series is one of the most useful series on youtube i have a commonplace book in evernote and im always amazed at the gems ive come across over the years you spinning around by a hot tub when you were talking about selfcare is such a vibe love the idea of organising ideas according to actionability felt called out by hoarding your ideas thank you for this breakdown of the book ali noted as a must read and i also need to work expressing my finds,2

sometimes when you are in a dark place you think that you are buried but you have actually been planted if you are going through that hard time just know that i am cheering for you,2
the amount of time we spend believing we cant is more than enough time to learn how you can my brain,1
to absorb what one reads its crucial to master concentration when i started reading in my early youth my mind would wander before finishing a page over time my concentration improved to a point where i could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought activities like chess reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration i know a buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment its a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline its literally rewired his brain schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning,2
i was born into a relatively poor family never had the opportunity to go to college i became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school i happened to live in a town that had one of the top business schools in the us i would go to the university library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught within months i had the knowledge of an mba by the time i was i started my own company and was a millionaire before i turned it took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you i finally found a banker that would talk to me i explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money i would borrow he was floored,2
be a teacher but forever a student listening in itself is a lost art so difficult to run across a good listener joe rogan comes to mind i really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with elon as his guest i dont necessarily agree with elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts what i like about joe is he gives his guests time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs or agenda like so many on the tell a vision being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort,2
the most important thing for learning like musk says is understanding the fundamentals of whatever it is you want to understand always always always build a solid foundation and then everything else will make perfect sense,2
i love elon he makes it cool to be smart hes a genius,2
the saying goes a jack of all trades is a master of none but still always better than a master of one so arguably elon is a good example rather than proving it wrong,2
as an undergrad i had to take history and im an mathscience person who hates history on my own i learned to rearrange stories in my head to make it make sense to me i would exchange real people with people i knew to relate to the topics i scores a hundred on about every exam when most were struggling the nstructor made a comment that it was one person who always scored a hundred they were like who who because theres no way his tests were long when i told them what i was doing to remember the content they laughed but i was like it works and believe it or not i still remember most of it and that was years ago,0
hi everyone as a few of you have pointed out the map at incorrectly shows taiwan as a part of china sorry for the error,0
the loss of knowledge is an issue that preoccupies me its very common to this day even in regular companies there are times when something breaks and no one knows how to fix it because the last guy who knew about it left the company ten years ago,0
as someone who was born in dhaka and learned about dhaka muslin as a kid seeing the fabric being covered here was a treat to remember thanks for shining light on it,2
i was born in dhaka and have never even heard of this muslin it makes me really sad to think how much of our culture and knowledge was destroyed,0
ah colonialism destroy a cotton crop species that is highly valued replace it with a poor lowvalue alternative eventually recreate the plant and hold market monopoly for expensive product great job,0
i love this its easy to fall into the trap of thinking that people before us were dumber because they didnt have the same kind of modern technology as we do but they were just as smart working with their own tools at the time to the point where some of it stumps us supposedly advanced modern folk if they didnt bother to write it down,1
the process of han purple seems to me like it was a byproduct of a different and more broadly useful compound or material being made for example i would be curious as to what the bronze smelting processes and practices were like and if any of those materials were used as a flux to strip impurities out of the molten alloy,1
my grandmother had a sari made of dhaka muslin i remember as a kid hugging her and remember how soft it was i miss her so much,2
the british east india corporation didnt just muck with the indianbangladesh textiles they literally had mercenaries go around cutting off the thumbs of weavers and smashing their looms this is called the deindustrialization of india and south east asia all this information thanks to shashi tharoor,1
i think one of the greatest losses to history is that most people think egypt and china are very far from each other yes they are quite distant and it would take an individual months to do it but it wasnt an individual it was a series of peoples just because they didnt have planes or the combustion engine doesnt mean people werent crossing continents not a person or persons but people your friendly neighborhood druid,0

everybody you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds i have done this in california many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa it takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach the next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains you can even grow it as a houseplant but beware it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy if you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in it likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt crumbled rock and sand in a very hot place where its occasionally watered thats what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun it would be a cool school science project to do with kids the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not,1
i never even heard of the royal variety and i love quinoa,2
that pink dust flying everywhere looks wild it s so amazing that this crazy nutritious stuff grows out in salt flats where nothing else grows the plant turns barren earth into highly nutritious food so cool,2
to the ones saying that its their fault for overexploiting quinoa production bolivia is the poorest country in all of south america rural people especially indigenous people living in the altiplano literally dont have enough money to live a propper life the quinoa boom meant that thousands of families could aford education bettering its living standars and getting out of poverty its really easy to talk about how unsustainable their practices where when your country got rich trough just as unsustainable practices plus the exploitation of millions of human beings,0
one very nutritious food with one very beautiful scenery you cant miss that beautiful scenery in the background,2
watching this made me want to eat quinoa now i ve never tried it i wonder how it compares to rice,1
this thing grows in my garden i always thought it was alien vegetation never knew it was edible,0
i recently got into quinoa from a caesar salad that had crisped quinoa i bought a bag of q and am going to try to crisp some up myself very interesting video,2
thanks bolivia for creating beautiful and nutritious quinoa i hope and believe rain and animals will nurish the land in coming years,2
beautiful place probably the only place id be convinced to become a farmer,2

i can t believe how many people are trying to find error or something wrong with his plan what works for some wont work for all his situation could literally be his situation the in a million the perfect alighted moment in time i would ve thought there would be more positive i spirited or constructive comments this is so sad he s and trying instead of waiting for opportunities to find him,0
this dude knows more about running a business at age than anyone i know in business grad school salute daily,2
it s funny bc i went to high school with mikael we were both in the same grade but he s actually the most successful kid that i know that came from our graduation class,2
smart kid not many figure out the art of business rite off the rip this kid will be successful,2
hes spot on with that maintenance number of ive owned my trucking company years now and that figure has always worked someone taught this young man well hes wayyyyy ahead of the learning curve of this industry,2
first off i would like to congratulate you and the entire team on making it up to k subscribers that is a huge huge achievement there is still a long way to go i subbed to this amazing channel back when it had just k subs i have been here since almost a year now time flies by for sure i dont have a lot to say about this video since its pretty technical im not really a huge fan of trucks i will say however that i want you guys to get back to this guy and see how hes doing in a couple years this guy definitely thinks big and i love that he is such a huge inspiration i have started my affiliate marketing and already made k in just months its nothing compared to the amount of money he makes but we will get there for sure kudos to you guys again you are doing such an amazing job can you please make the vending machine video i believe you made one go live i would love that thanks also what happened to the qa bliz you didnt do it this time why i was interested in knowing what books he reads if any looking forward to a next video of yours when is it coming i noticed the last video was deleted which is kind of a bummer since i didnt get to watch it all in time,2
he is guys seriously instead of making positive comments you talk about how much he makes it s not all about money in this life the kid is a good example for many of us out here,2
amazing interview startling how much he has done at such a young age good lessons on the virtues of hard work and resourcefulness must have had terrific parents at home to encourage and guide his endeavors,2
i ve never seen a speech that motivates me more business is about learning not taking stupid risks that aren t calculated what an incredible talk,2
your businesses will make you rich but your investments will make you wealthy the future is inevitable i pray everyone here becomes extremely successful,2
greatest point for me was work like everyones trying to take it away from you almost every industry ive been in i trusted too much and right others including my managers and they took my knowledge and passed it as if it was theres they took it from me i dont trust like that anymore and i dont teach everything i know anymore because of that knowledge is power,0
i m late and my business started really randomly and unexpectedly lol i wanted to buy some leather goods but the prices killed me so i was like ya know what im cheap im gonna make my own stuff and spent tons of time on youtube and google learning and messing up and leaning new things from the ways i messed up then my family was impressed by the finished result which surprised me and they told me i should start a business so i was like welp why not give it a shot and i ve only very recently started but so far alhamdulillah i ve been blessed and it s going better than id imagined the beginning would go moral of the story is be cheap learn a skill from that cheapness and capitalize on that in my first week i made more than in a month at previous jobs i ve had throughout high school and i ve actually been able to enjoy it learn things while making money and look at all of my work and feel fulfilled and happy unlike any of my other jobs,2

i watched my father start and run his business it s incredibly hard long hours lots of sacrifice requires risk tolerance but also you must be mentally tough to get through all the obstacles most people cannot handle the level of stress that comes along with it,0
people fail because of lack of effort or lack of patience there is much more than that and now when im doing videos on youtube i totally understand why people quit its really challenging and sometimes you have no motivation to continue anyway great video,0

laundromats rental property storage facility transportation vending machines agriculture dump truck,1
ive been a painting contractor for years just me and my brother except for the first few years when the winter was a little tricky weve been super busy the whole time all residential we have a van a paint sprayer and a powerwasher and a bunch of ladders and basic other supplies get good at something nobody wants or has time to do and youll always be busy you must do excellent work as well all our customers are our sales agents it has a low overhead you can expand if you want with employees but that does make it a bit more complicated,2
i knew a guy that had a side business laundromat he put his two kids on the payroll while they were in college essentially his kids college bills were tax deductible and the kids income was so low they did not have to pay income tax on the income,1
sir had you mentioned the profitability in each of these business along with the headaches of maintenance like maximum in dump trucks additional knowledge required employees required etc your video would have been excellent by the way real estate rental business is the best with adding appreciation good luck,2
there is always a risk associated with starting a business i agree with this thats the reality not all of the businesses are most likely to succeed but it is always up to us whether to persevere for another day or to just give up it is important to build a business you are passionate and compassionate to continue every day dont forget to invest in your knowledge and your business improvement rather than on growing profits alone,2
i worked at a large grocery store for years upstairs in the break room they had a soda and two candy chip vending machines they were owned by a local outside company that did a ton of vending machines in this area i asked the gm why not spend a couple grand and save a tone of money we are a grocery store we sell everything in these and could cut the cost in half and still make a profit she agreed and walked away,1
awesome video thanks for the great information i own rentals too and love it it takes some time to figure things out but thats true of anything keep up the great work and look forward to more videos,2
well explained sir i am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency not just as a money equivalent but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work,2
where i live i have never seen a betting shop close down one round the corner from me has been open for over years theres a constant stream of customers going into these places and even with internet competition they still seem to thrive betting shops is where i would strongly consider investing it cigarettes is another one bat share price just goes up and up warren buffet loves the tobacco industry and who can blame him with those huge profits even with all the bad write up about the dangers of smoking people still do it as its so highly addictive two businesses that just dont fail betting shops and cigarettes they even have a strong link,2
love the breakdown ive gradually built my finance and made my first k through investing which ive used to start my jewellery business and with what i ve learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out so the onus is on newbies to beware having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,2
well explained i appreciate i cant wait to get started because people are really making a lot of money from it nowadays,2
for someone who has not started their investment journey but done alot of research in this economic climate am i better to save and enter the market when i see companies at my price points or to invest a of my savings each month,1

if you are going to start a vending business giving customers the option to use cards will increase your sales a ton fewer people carry cash especially in small denominations the customer with larger bills will not use your machines until they break their bill at another retailer which will likely have snacks and drinks at their pos for impulse purchases,1
i live in a rural area agriculture is a very high risk business that takes enormous upfront investment yes food will always be needed but mother nature is notoriously unreliable and global markets are fickle this is the reason large corporate entities are and have taken over the family farm which has brought on the deaths of countless small towns,0
excellent cryptonaire course here is a complete beginner guide i now have a core understanding of how to start trading forex learn what forex is what we trade how to make money trading forex thanks for sharing this insightful tips,2
you are a very smart salesman and entrepreneur iman much respect,2
youre a genius iman you supply us with the foundation for free so we as viewers know where to start thus know what to research but you also supply your own service with it all it is absolutely brilliant a fantastic ad if you will which shows how great of a marketer you truly are genius,2
the recent content feels better than ever before and the frequency of uploads is just perfect can see how much work is being put into this,2
the video is great especially when you talk about the agency business model although i disagree about some other business models generalizations for example on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once its an option theres revenue sharing pay per sale etc from dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle costumer the margins game is highly variable and thats where some people get ahead of others nevertheless selling roi services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency website content and all,2
love the content and urge of openning peoples eyes to see where the future is heading to great work g,2
thank you iman for this awesome video you explain everything so clear i will analyze everything and watch more of your videos to try and start on my own and hopefully one day buy your course appreciate it man,2

ethan has given more publicity to tate than tate has done for himself,1
thanks guys for showing me this video i didnt know about this course but thanks for promoting it becuase now im probably going to invest in it thanks to you guys,2
why do people keep platforming this guy ethan videos ago with tates name in the title your literally going to be the only one platforming him at this rateanything for clicks,0
thanks for keeping me in the loop with tate i always have hard time finding channels who cover his daytoday but in h i trust,2
i love how ethan just gets shit on at his own highlights channel,0
ethan said this is the last video on tate videos ago dude cant stop talking about him you can tell what tate said about him scarred him and hes been traumatized by it is and this is his way of letting out his trauma,0
tate has to find a new scheme to launder his money a foundation with a well funded trust might be enough to gain some kickbacks for new side deals perhaps if he grows some hair he might grow a new found sense of purpose,1
i wish ethan would meet andrew tate in real life he would be outmatched,1
ethan has had the biggest fall i ve seen in recent years such a shame the dude just sits on his ass all days and hates on other people,0
i want to see ethan reply to andrew tate s final video message lol,1
were going exactly in the direction we shouldnt go kudos to the effort,2
goldmine or not accepting this concept as the future of clothing is not only deceptive but its also psychologically destructive ill pass,0
why do we need a metaverse why are we doing this it literally makes no sense why were pushing this so hard,0
i think animated clothing that cannot be easily replicated in physical form would have high potential here like magical clothes or a fashion aurabut cosplaying this in physical reality would be cumbersome and keeping all those in your closet is tough take it from cosplayers we know,1
i cant stress this enough pricing does not always reflect demand,0
isnt it just glorified fashion illustration essentially these are d drawings thats it actual fashion and the beauty of it is conquering your fashion sketches conquering your elaborate ideas by overcoming physical obstacles that is one of the main reason we love fashion to draw an haute couture dress is somewhat easy but to make it is beyond hard making a dress is a journey for all the people involved that is how innovation happens these animated pieces remind me the s licensing craze or something of sort it is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money it is not the future of fashion it is just a new market for fashion to expand silly gimmicks bringing big buck thats about it,2
people are dying out of hunger but some are spending money on things that dont exist we have truly reached the point of no return,0
i bought a large plot of land in the metaverse and i hope my kids can build and start families on it,2
i don t know y all i really loved imvu the sims as a kid i literally found imvu because i was looking to play a dress up game nd life was a huge game at the time but it more for adults this is definitely going to take off the real question is how will be balance our real reality,2
great video guys very insightful though i feel that pros of digital fashion are much less than the cons attached to it but these two worlds will surely coexist in the future,2
the rich stays rich by spending like the poor and investing without stopping then the poor stays poor by spending like the rich yet not investiing like the rich,1
props to shaan for being honest about his lack of game most people would try to embellish their pick up skills,1
please do more of this love every single idea you guys went over interested in doing swag school with you i am a dev probs dont need a lot of engineering work for swag school though and the idea definitely resonates with me not that i need swag school myself,2

love the breakdown i started my first business from money i made off dividends with what i ve learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out so the onus is on newbies to beware having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,2
this was so specific to me thanks,2
thats it i am starting my own websiteblog documenting the upcoming final year in my masters my thoughts and process of starting my own youtube channel and working on my masters thesis i will also try and get over my perfectionist mentality and just write something anything and improve as i continue on the journey thank for another great video ali,2

the offer to work for free thing is surprisingly rare but great advice i took a gamble and emailed a company i covered in my psychology bsc to ask if i could come work for them for free and they gave me a paid gig as a trial years later and i m now managing director in all those years not one person has attempted the same thing,2
love this video as someone who is currently working in a generally gigbased industry im always looking ways to create some passive income that i can always fall back on and this was a very well thoughtout and informative video thanks ali,2
every overnight success was years in the making but because few build in public people mistake the highlight reel for the start,1
i m starting a new business currently this is extremely helpful thank you ali,2

look man you folks have changed my life ive been struggling to make my design business profitable for almost a decade and because i couldnt figure it out myself ive been being employed by companies that dont serve me or my wallet ive been living short of my purpose and i knew it i have been watching this channel for weeks and i have already started networking smarter charging more being more aggressive with my design style and approach i feel confident and you chris do have given me that as a creative i dont know if ill ever be able to thank yourepay you but know that you changed a mans life with what you know thank you so much and keep building the future,2
this was amazing thank you chris love the emphasis on value and that the buyer determines it i learned not to waste time trying to convince someone to see value you can help them realize the value but you can t force them to change what they value that s a losing game,2
so glad this made it to chris desired metric im only minutes in and have received massive value from this thank you so much chris i am still in the beginning stages of getting my photovideo portfolio ready but this massively changes how i think about pricing and will be extremely beneficial when i start to take on paid work,2
this guy is one of the best business teachers ive ever studied with on youtube,2
i watch elon musk videos to grow back the neurons i lost throughout the day looking at memes,2
starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss having started small corner stores myself this quote is very true,1
for sure the reality business is hard and painful and takes a huge amount of effort if you want to build something great the best quote i heard was nobody is expecting you to do something amazing but it is amazing when you do something the reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global but you might build something that brings value and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different you can only admire what elon musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future,2
me came here for business ideas elon musk neurological computers genetics and electric aircraft me guess ill stick to selling things on ebay,1
i already lost a lot of money recently trying to pursuit my dreams its frustrating and depressing but elon definitely gives me hope and determination he is a role model for me,2
its touching to hear elon talk about wanting to bridge a gap between the genetically unfortunate with intelligence augmentation my mother has a hereditary severe brain disease that affected her life disabled her the impact of her brain health affected my developmentlife and my brain health the genetic component also affected my brain health currently im functionally disabled from it too its a constant chronic hell cycle its comforting to know someone out there as dedicated and capable as elon musk is thinking about disadvantaged people like my mother i,1
if your customers love you your odds of success are dramatically higher great stuff,2
at elon says something quite profound entrepreneurs are born of everyday this resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday they are problem solvers its quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses,2

not to mention that the gop stopped caring about actually governing long ago,0
after decades in gop colo sen kevin priola says we need democrats in charge,1
the gop has to stop with the delusions of grandeur,0
she s right the root problem is the appetite for idiocy how do you think we got donald into office,0
how did he even get on the ballot there has to be some intellectual people in our government or its doomed,0
am so grateful when people are serious and honest it s not only effecting people in us also outside,2
you can hardly expect the republican party to tell voters that they only represent the very rich and corporations so its either lie or risk people not voting for them,0
this guy has had too many hits to his headamerica you are in trouble,0
we must continue to speak out against unqualified candidates like dr oz herschel adam laxalt and several az candidates,1

i m impressed with max the dude is super smart and running this like a high performing tech startup best coffee shop interview yet,2
i was losing my confidence in thinking my dream of opening up a local coffee shop would be impossible but this story was so inspiring mooney is so damn down to earth its really cool to see the success of just the love and passion into it,2
wow amazing maxwell just gave away the secret to running a successful business i own and operate my own company and of what he said is something you cant learn from school honestly well done,2
first met max back when he was still operating out of the coffee stall hes a great entrepreneur and skilled coffee shop owner,2
maxvell is such a great person hes very generous with his knowledge and experience and thats sadly hard to find nowadays hes also extremely capable business owner with amazing systems implemented in the business,2
as a business owner and video enthusiast i love your channel the details you get about business operations are fantastic your video production has continued to improve and is amazing the lighting transitions pacing camera motion and audio are absolutely top level and this video took lighting to a new level can you add the camera video production gear you use to your resources section of the description thanks very much for the great content,2
maxwell is an incredible guy i love how deep he dove into understanding not just coffee but the processes and most importantly customer experience what an inspiration,2
felt like this was a tech startup more than a coffee shop this guy is so well organized and passionate about his business,2
i love this interview ive been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last years we moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within miles i keep telling people i know i dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said i should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church i was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time im scared to start even though i have a lot of support at church and friends one of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people but again my family is relying on my income to live i know it would be great i just need to find a person i trust to help run it along side with me so i can maintain my insurance career at the same time since its not demanding at all,2

it makes sense btc and crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen the big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize the projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space i d get involved more knowing that i have made over btc and eth from daytrade with leroy davids crypto in few weeks,1
as you can see we are already in august and i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over btc when i started at btc in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from liberton corp would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,2
although i have interests in global economics i dont watch the news anymore i have enough fud thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate timesevents like this youre right about keeping level headed when investing so thats why i think its important to limit the amount of fud we consume i dont watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if i were to watch the news everyday now i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over k from day trading with liberton corp signal in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1
libertoncorp is young holding almost anything mentioned here is a good hold because the vhs or beta will only show in time i want to hold them early its sad that most dont think of these things as good future holds instead of being out of the market and bottom hunting are we the adopters or are we scavengers surely one of these layer ones will become the standard and i dont want to sell any of them too early,1
i sincerely appreciate the work youve done and the knowledge you share technical analysis can be helpful but i think it is quite puzzling that wellknown cryptocurrency youtubers just pay attention to pure ta and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems ignoring the reality that each etf launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from btc highs is somewhat dangerous we were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly whale pumps day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the markets situation trading daily with libertoncorp i have earned over btc using his insights and charts his insight has always been a step ahead of others,1
when referencing corporate america he said they don t really care about you as they make it seem realest thing he saidi ve seen experienced it first hand in the dmv black ppl aren t really respected in corporate america glad that he was able to get out of there and become his own boss libertoncorp,1
keep up the great work you are truly an asset to the community thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage btcs price has been fluctuating lately buying isnt a tough call but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage in understanding chart wont guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader libertoncorp i made btc from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market i m still bagging more money,2
honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over btc from day tradng with liberton corp insights and charts his been one step ahead of other analysisstick with btcethbnbadamatic,0

this is unbelievable how many of these people get away with this,0
he needs to be treated and punished just like any other person,0
no one is above the law his wife says words have no conviction when its for your drunken husband,0
yes personal responsibility quit blaming the person who served him he s an adult he chose to drink drive,0
any of us would get months in jail for drunkenly crashing and injuring someone,0
i feel bad for the cop who arrested him because hell probably get worse punishment than this criminal,0
normal person would end up with a much longer sentence this is beyond wrong,0
unreal two tiered justice,0

high fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous but if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too you find artisans people who study and excel in a craft they deserve to be highlighted more behind that overpriced chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption landfills toxic chemical dumped in village waters people paid pennies etc haute couture is rare it s scarce i find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but i love my high end pieces that have lasted me years and will continue to do so behind these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast producing machine,0
imran interviews the most powerful individuals in the fashion industry but i truly believe he holds just as much influence this series is exactly what the industry needs in terms of consumers listening and fellow designersindustry professionals taking note imran is the projector of those poignant words and as a collective it holds much greater power,2
luxury fashion is one of the worlds biggest industries i think this is a great topic for a bloomberg series i would be interested is seeing more of this type of content i am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between gucci and balenciaga especially now that i know they both come under the kering umbrella other recent collaborations include versace and fendi which could be the subject of another video the more recent video in this series examines the chinese market and how fashion brands are now targeting young asian consumers,2
the worst thing to happen to fashion was influencers who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic they re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same,0
i love how luxury is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich like what really is the point here is it the small artisans who get and praise or the fashion houses and companies that actually get to design exploit labor and sell for profit the definition just isn t strong enough for me to care,0
i used to love high fashion but the more i learn about what goes on in the industry the more i feel like pursuing a different career choice so much nepotism elitism and lack of creativity it s almost as if you don t fit within certain enclaves you re not welcomed,0
i love the new sustainability efforts excited to see new changes,2
people are really stuck on the price tags and not understanding that couture is only made to order by experts in their fields thats what this video is looking at these pieces are art and art is different for everyone just because you dont like this version of art doesnt make you better than those who do i could never afford these pieces but that doesnt stop me from really appreciating the vision behind it,1
what annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag,0
i switched years ago from fashion to reupholstery so glad i get to reduce reuse upcycle last of a dying breed of the world do what we still do,2
as a fellow asian i can confidently say that the rarest thing in this video was kyles beautiful stache,2
man i could feel his palpable frustration at losing that first fish in addition to having a film crew pester him asking what happened handled that moment like a champ,1
back in i caught a pound king upriver along the klutina river feeder river to the copper river and it was one of the best days of my life that was a reel workout,2
i always enjoyed selling this product as a fishmonger it was something my guest looked forward to and i was happy to sell it rly is top tier fish and some i do quite respect,2
so glad kyle brought up how important salmon are for native alaskan communities,2
wish kyle and his crew all the luck to always bring home king salmon every time they go out to fish for it,2
i was lucky to have copper river salmon once it was by far the best salmon i ve ever tasted,2
im really glad he acknowledged the indigenous traditions and food culture there are a lot of fishermen that dont care about preservation or morals,2
its fascinating that a gill netted fish in an estuary not at the peak of their growth cycle garners so much money when compared to troll caught kings on hook and line when theyre still putting on fat that are treated immediately to ike jima processed individually and then hand packed on ice to get core temps down immediately,2
i am happy for this dude he seem happy and humble i wish him nothing but luck,2

hamza i just wanted to say thank you brother i know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life months ago i was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live i randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools strategies and philosophies you teach since then i truly would not be here without you and i am so grateful for you i now have a purpose and direction in my life outside of the youtube videos i watch like yours that have high roi on my time i am off social media completely im years old and im still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this it gets better happiness peace and prosperity take time hard work and a lot of effort but it is so worth it i am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community i just today did my first cold approach and it went well if anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men,2
thanks for having me on the stream hamza i wish i said more and i wish i was more clear with my words but i was nervous anyways i rewatched the chat and had a good laugh saw a lot of toxicity and criticism but all is welcome the chat was really funny and any criticism i got i deserved thanks again hamza this was an awesome opportunity to talk to you even if we didn t talk mainly about the subject we were supposed to enjoy life,2
these men are on the right path,2
thanks again for your time hamza i still cant remember how i stumbled on your channel but youve given me good info that keeps me on the right path and youve helped me value my masculinity for the first time in years ill be sure to let you know if theres any updates on my situation,2
huge w for admiting that it takes a lot of courage idk if you will read this but if you do i want you to know that i respect you a lot,2
what hamza said about being careful about momentous emotional self improvement decisions driven by motivation really hits home for me fallen off the wagon on no fap drinking diets etc because of it in the not too distant past invaluable advice for a young man,2
hamza is a man of legacymay allah bless your work and soul and guide all of us to the right path,2
i just wanted to say thank you hamza you provide me and so many other guys with the kind of wisdom it would takes years of mistakes to eventually gain hope everyone who reads this keeps growing and progressing,2
these new streams are definitely a great addition to the arsenal of the hamza content,2
well done hamza you helped a lot of guys respect,2
if this doesn t show how disgusting spoiled and wasteful we are as a society i don t know what does,0
despite the economic downturn im having the best time of my life financially earning over k in the last months with an investment of money can be made even in a bear market make the most of it,2
my concern is that with the big players waking up to this business model they will muscle in easily and squeeze out these little guys who was doing well below the radar now that the cat is out of the bag their profitability will experience more headwinds going forward,0
nothing brings me more satisfaction than efficiency to think about how all that merchandise is going to be resold and not go into a landfill makes me very happy indeed,2
i remember watching a documentary about how the area of west africa had become a dumping ground for usedunwanted clothes from europe and the americas more specifically the north americas i was totally shocked and had no idea about this villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot sometimes with their kids to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever,0
i have yet to make a return to amazon that wasn t damaged double shipped or not as described they could avoid a lot of returns by better vetting i also often select returned items if the saving are worth it so far no problems,2
this is one of the coolest things ive noticed recently when ollies popped up in my hometown selling namebrand goods at a quarter of the original pricei knew liquidation stores would be the way of the future i love it it makes me happy seeing these goods find homes instead of ending up as pollution,2
as a person who shops on the clearance aisles at stores im loving this documentary its an industry not many people think of on a large scale but definitely very profitable,2
the only issue is that the majority of customers are resellers so most consumers aren t getting the discount but either way it helps the environment which is great,2
it s buyer behavior it goes beyond buying up multiple sizes to see what fits i ve sold on ebay for years with no issue same individual item again and again one year i sold on amazon and i was blown away by the types of buyers i had many requested a cancellation of purchase which i gladly did i don t want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made many also requested a return claiming the item was defective but when i paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to amazons return policies the item would be returned in perfect working condition i don t know if people are buying suggested items without thinking or assuming they ll get something free if they complain but i can t imagine the horror if i had to trash every single return i got sometimes after paying for the return shipping label the buyer would never ship all they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie,1
white dude creates black ai dude that was the first mistake,0
ai music is this music for people that hate music,0
racism and stereotype not withstanding cause its really really bad this is horrible walk to the store levels of bad cgi gold star to anyone that gets that reference,0
really this is where we are headed with music and entertainment i like my artists real and human i mean what could possibly go wrong with a room full of white guys conjuring up an ai black rapper,0
imagine the terminator but programmed by a white supremacist then realize elon musk completely ignores racism at tesla and has turned into an authoritarian facist and hes creating sentient androids oh and hes a south african emerald farmer the republicans will just claim that the robots went crazy,0
it s about the money of course if an exec can sign a robot they can churn out crap x,0
hes a singing toaster wasteman running volts for a pulse,1
the ai rapper became aware of itself and decided to sign with kanye,1
this to me is a reflection of our society it looks like we still have growing up to do usually if you have to think twice about it ask the internet theyll get you perspective,1
wow they really dont want to pay artist at all anymore we will make an ai slave is what they did wtf,0
i love how the newer music artists are paying homage to the old school beats it gives it a different feel but latto she doing her ish,2
they did a damn good job with this sample beat goes crazyyyyy,2
the young queen latto delivers every time props to the artist but she s going to make it sell capricorn energy all day my kids kids gone have they way on godgenerational wealth health wisdom overflow,2
i loved this the flow of lakeyah is satisfying,2
latto and lakeyah have such complimentary flows and deliveries they are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat i think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab i hope someday i can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music truly unmatched energy,2
respect to lakeyah fr she is truly flourishing and big latto killed her verse per usual,2
the first thing i want you to knowwhom ever you might be is that god loves you i dont care what you have done in the past i dont care of the mistakes you have made the blunders we all have he loves you i want you to understand that millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn in just a few moments time if you believe it is all god requires believe it forget about your past when they put jesus in that tomb they put all of your sins in that tomb as well when jesus walked out of that tomb he walked out victorious and we came out with him a new creation in christ jesus i am going to pray and i want you to pray with me i am going to say the words that you need to say saying words cannot save you but if you truly believe in your heart you will be saved and i want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart and jesus christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life let us pray dear god in heaven i come to you i am sorry for my sins and the way i have lived the things i have done please forgive me cleanse me with your precious blood from every sin i have ever committed right now with my mouth i confess the lord jesus and in my heart i believe that jesus died for me and rose from the dead and i accept jesus christ this very moment as my savior my redeemer and i make him the lord of my life and right now i am a new creation i am washed i am cleansed i am saved we ask this all in the name of jesus amen,2
their flow on this production is,2
killed it the beat so hard,2
this is an amazing story most times it amazes me greatly how i moved from an average lifestyle to earning over k per month utter shock is the word i have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities are bound in the financial markets the only thing is to know where to focus,2
i think this is very inspiring and a big shoutout to anyone who is brave enough to follow their dreams and pursue a career or lifestyle that isnt the norm,2
when can cbnc actually show someone who created something cool like a product turned business an interesting yt channel maybe they publish their own books etc rather than these woefully unqualified finance gurus who add more detriment than value to most of its customers,0
sick of cnbc only promoting these gurus that seem to have no financial background or successful track record other than selling to other poor people how to be rich fake it til you make it,0
you can afford anything she says reporter asks what if i want a yacht then it changes to you can afford anything within reason imagine a counsellor or coach saying i ll help you to achieve your goal then you pay them for months and they say not that goal because that s impossible we don t set people up to fail by selling promises that sound goodhowever good luck to this woman for becoming wealthy and if people choose to buy her services and products that s their choice,1
everyones a finance guru now no real credentials but she has a podcast guys,1
man finance channels really are the way to go cries in travel nah just kidding nothing beats a vacation wheels up kudos to her her fans seem to be getting valuable info,2
investing is so important in life so important i cant explain enough the importance of starting early and keeping the course love the video and i hope you make more videos on investing in the future,2
building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from and ends up haunting them in the near future putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it youre not going to remember those expensive shoes you bought ten years ago but you will remember every single morning when you look at your bank account that extra in there i promise thats going to be way more fun to look at everyday i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,2
everyone should become a finance guru no one will be poor,2

get your cute scrunchies with pockets here only shipping anywhere,2
small business be like a pretty box pretty filling with an extra and amazon be like here s a brown box take it or leave it,2
packing a fake order till i get a real one that hit so hard i really hope she gets orders and her business blooms,2
i feel so fake wanting to make a business because i feel whatever i make has already been made and idk if it s gonna be better than those already made so it scares me,0
it s so inspiring to new entrepreneurs to see others also starting their own businesses good luck to anyone who s opening their first business,2
the detail and thoughtfulness some of these people put into their packaging is just insane obviously whether the product itself is actually good is another matter but just the sheer creativity beauty and detail in the presentation would probably make me wanna order from them again even if the product itself wasnt anything super special that kind of packaging makes receiving the product an experience like getting an incredible delightful present i would be smiling like crazy and squealing with delight as soon as i open a box like that would probably make my whole week these people are so cool and i admire and respect them so much,2
just gonna add some positivity in the comment section by saying i m so proud of of these people with their small business im personally too afraid to start my own business not yet at least but these people just straight up sent it with whatever they got lol i genuinely wish all of them to do well,2
i m as well and i was inspired to start my own business by these tiktoks i started painting custom ordered seashells i m so happy with how my business turned out d all i did to figure out what i was going to sell is i went around my room five times with my eyes closed and what ever my finger landed on i sold and it landed on a seashell and that s how my business started i would really recommend starting your own business as a past time it s also a great way to earn money and allowance as a kid and it s so fun to do i really enjoy it it can be stressful at times but it s so worth it d,2
i feel like small business owners like put their heart and soul into their packages and try to get it shipped in time but they still dont get appreciated for their hard work,0
the package look more expensive than the actual product,0

im overwhelmed when trying to learn how to use canva by myself because therere tons of functions thank you for making this video using canva is much eas er now,2
wow just finished your tutorial it took me somewhere between three and four hours to go through it because i stopped it all the time to try out almost everything you had just presented in order to remember things better and while doing so actually discovered a few more things i also appreciated some of your design ideas which further opened my eyes to the endless possibilities canva offers i had already watched a number of other tutorials some also very well presented but most are way too short they just awaken your curiosity but then leave you hanging there struggling after having worked through your tutorial i feel that i hit the ground running and am now off to your other tutorials to learn more having come down with covid fortunately not too bad i still have a few more days of quarantene left that i will use for studying and practising more,2

by far the best excel tutorial i have seen for beginners complete basic to the point and very useful in real life situations great course thank you shad sluiter for sharing,2
your explanations are simple and fluid you have deconstructed all the difficulty myths related to learning excel hats off and thank you,2
thank you so much for this i had an easy time following the pace of the course also the examples and exercises were great with minutes per day i could complete the course in days good stuff,2
most logical and very easytounderstand course content his way of explaining is incomparable to anyone in his profession and the topic is covered vividly and never feels bored i gained so strong knowledge immensely in a tiny time hat off to the professor youre the great teacher to me i ever had in this field sir best wishes for your future tutorials and life as well,2
excellent practical course for someone who knows only the very minimal basics if that well modulated and articulated designed for adult self learners easy to follow and it is a plus that you did not use techie language your presentation style made it easy to follow without distractions real life examples are a plus application of knowledge always enhances learning looking forward to your next course,2
im about minutes in and i gotta admit you are brilliant at organizing what you want to teach youve managed to organize even zooming in and out at specific intervals to teach all those small aspects of the program really cool i never knew excel was so intuitive either,2
this was an excellent class well done in organization methods and process there are lots of tools out there but this class is better because problems are solved as examples are worked out in this way it keeps your attention while deepening the learning,2
get the notes and code for this course here,1
one hour into this video and i have learned more about how to use apis and postman than i have with tons of other videos combined i cant see how video instruction can get better than this all the money i have spent to learn this and actually understand it and this video instructor provides the most precise explanation i have seen to date excellent work,2
there is so much thought process and hard work put in by the content creators we need this kind of content more so that students feel more confident learning newer things i have become a huge fan of the channelhats off to you guys keep doing this great work,2
here i am employed as a developer watching a video that purports to be for beginners and its a great video so far one of the things i love about approaches like this is that especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks for instance i know what statelessness means generally but then at around craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the contextwith no extraneous details nice work,2
you guys make learning fun the fact that you went over apis in a broad sense and not just webbased really nailed home what an api really is wow,2
im enjoying your tutorial a lot but a side note i think its recommended to invoke pip as python m pip because it is more portable having recently had issues due to windows and trying naively to just invoke pip on its own i thought it would be worth mentioning especially since this is aimed at beginners who might struggle with issues like that cheers,2
this was truly a whirlwind introduction to apis i believe it was a little more harder for me as i havent started to learn java yet still learning python but none less this is an extremely well done course thank you craig for your work and i will now take another rest as ive reached the end to unscramble my brain,2
this is easily the best course in this section hats of to this guy didnt feel like boring bombarment of information enjoyed every moment of it,2
such an approachable manner of teaching craig thank you even as a refresher for me i just felt compelled to keep listening through am sure this has been extremely useful for introducing newcomers into coding no end,2
i havent finished yet but wonderful explanations and great examples so far with teachers like this learning is a joy,2

this guy actually puts in a lot of effort in his tutorials as far as i can infer i noticed that whenever he accidentally said something wrong for example he said age instead of name hell put the correct word in the background meaning that he actually gone through the entire video again before publishing to check for errors,1
i just want to say that in my job i write sql coding every day and i m branching out now learning c just as a hobby currently and this video is seriously one of the best instruction videos mike is awesome i wish he had a followup for teaching advanced c i just love his way of teaching it s excellent precise not overly wordy and simple and the best thing is he runs his query after every example so we can clearly see the output seriously he is the best great speaker and presenter edit just a note but mike even explained loops which also occur in sql and it s something i honestly haven t ever really fully grasped before but because of this video i finally get it this actually is going to positively effect my job too not just my hobby just wonderful teaching,2
great tutorial its hard to find someone who explains the basics as well as touching on more commonly used variables also thank you for leaving in your mistakes it helps knowing that experienced programmers still miss common mistakes,2
i needed to learn something about c in a hurry my first thought was to seek you out again as expected you were clear and concise and made it all so easy you are a superstar,2
this was one of the few programming videos which i completed fully thanks to mike for explaining each and every concept crisp and clear eagerly excited to start my journey in programming,2
you taught me more in hours than my professor did in an entire semester,2
dude i dont know if you know but this tutorial is one of the cleanest concise on youtube the way you get to the point and explain well in brief manner makes learning c seem intuitive i know this is just the surface but it is presented in a way that makes it feel breezy and effortless,2
i love how he teaches multiple coding languages the same it makes learning them a lot easier and quicker to understand,2
this is awesome this is how a tutorial should be i did not think i could have finished it all the way and right now im already on if i can really make some good use of coding i will surely join id love to watch more of your tut,2
keep your database of accounts and passwords secure by using dashlane sign up now at and use the code networkchuck to get off dashlane at checkout walkthroughcommands join the networkchuck academy sponsored by dashlane intro what is sql let s make our own database and let s add some tables challenge create some tables by yourself let s remove the imposter in our data how do i update my tables what if i want to change the order how to alter your table this puts the relation in relational databases outro,1
yeah okay but im still learning the last thing you told me to learn right now,1
i ve done some sql database management in a gui before but learning to do it through a terminal has been awesome i would love to see a part two going over primary and foreign keys and database relationships the way you format your videos is great for learning and i love it thank you so much for the content you put out here s hoping for a part,2
i learned more from this video than i did from an entire semester of a watching paint dry intro to databases class thanks chuck,2
yes please chuck make more videos about sql you read my mind i just started to make a website with flask for python and a sqlite or mysql database thanks for the new video,2
i understand that this is for beginners just starting with sql but in my opinion you should always delete with unique value like id in this case because later youll probably have more than one jeff keep up the good work,2
just wanted to add that having strong knowledge of sql and databases in general is extremely helpful for developing queries and detection rules using tools like splunk spl or defender kql great video please get in the weeds,2
i was just thinking the other day that i really need to start learning sql beyond just using it blindly in applications great timing and really great intro for me looking forward to the next one,2
thank you sir this reminds me of a lesson i didnt understand in class but you made me understand about sql in just minutes with enjoyable explanation,2
that was extremely helpful wish they wouldve shown that in school when we were learning about databases and mysql,2
love how hayes reviewed swtor saw the terrible tutorial then made a whole video breaking down an effective tutorial,2
one thing with the dark souls tutorial is that the boulder will almost always hurt a new player so when they get the estus and told to use it they can see their health increase as a result,0
i love how having grown up with games im just taking these systems for granted and remember being annoyed with some and instantly engaged by others without knowing why either i have just been ignoring the obvious to not ruin the illusion or well im just not very good at reflecting over my hobby xd at any rate thanks for a very informative upload hail the shadow cabal,2
i cant comprehend how josh puts out so much content at such a high frequency thats over minutes long every time that man is a workhorse,1
john romero used to say that the first level in the game was the last level he designed by that time you already know what the whole game is going to play like and you can use that knowledge to weave it all together seamlessly it works perfectly for somewhat simple games like commander keen and doom and id like to think that it still works for more advanced or narrativedriven games thoughts,2
just the sight of a portal test chamber brings me joy,2
its amazing to me that guild wars had such an incredible tutorial island so much so that people spent years min maxing and living in it as a main point of playing said game and never leaving it for the pure enjoyment of it,2
while it is a good idea to seamlessly blend tutorial and initial gameplay i still have a soft spot for stuff like the hazard course in halflife which is an inuniverse training grounds for people to get familiar with the hev suit and in turn the game and its mechanics,2
honestly i feel like the most important option with a tutorial is the option to skip it entirely for replaying purposes and the option to revisit it at any point in the game,2
one of my friends gave up on monster hunter rise because he got overwhelmed by all the mechanics you can interact while having pretty much tutorials especially how weapons work and which are their movesets as a veteran i really no longer think about that but it reminded me how not having gradual introductions to the main mechanics of a game can turn many potential players away,0

i could cry i never make it through a full tutorial but you have made is so easy and fun to learn thank you so much for this video,2
this guy explained it exactly how it needs to be explained most people try to do tutorials that seem like they are for professionals but why would a professional be watching it great tutorial,2
i wish i had watched this earlier before i watched all other work flow tutorials this is not only a work flow tutorial but also a fundamental guidemanual of the software and explains what works how i understand lightroom much much better now and im excited to apply all of these to my next photo editing thank you so much best lightroom basic tutorial ever,2
this tutorial is amazing straight to the point and great energy thank you so much sawyer,2

i imagine gordon ramsay narrating his life the same way he does cooking door open close behind you incredible,1
the burger s was the best ever that we made on our grill our son made us follow everything ramsey said to do awesome thank you ramsey and rock on,2
i know everyone jokes about seasoning and gordon ramsay but i just love how passionate he is with cooking,2
i was able to make a perfect burger for the first time in my life by following your recipe and processes thank you,2
gordons solo cooking shows are awesome his videos look kind of complicated but theyre really pretty straightforward and common ingredients i feel dumb for never using a neutral oil grapeseed while grilling a burger that with the seasoning steps makes all the difference,2
he didnt season the burgers he burgered the seasoning,1
gordon you can t season a burger while it s cooked also gordon seasons a burger more when it s almost done,1
came to learn how to grill so i don t ruin my first cookout watched specifically how much time each side on the burger and i realized gordan flipped the burgers at and put them on at dude is precise,1
gordon ramsay is a wonderful person a master of his craft,2
this isn t cooking this is art,1

i am a totally layman but i finished watching this one hour course so interesting what a great teacher his teaching can even attract a person like me who just wish to know some basics of web development great job thanks mosh,2
introduction what you need languages and tools of web development how the web works inspecting http requests and responses html basics css basics formatting code inspecting pages using devtools validating web pages the head section text entities hyperlinks images,1
im a student software developer at vocational school and ive learned more in this video than ive learned at school since september great video,2
i cannot begin to thank you enough for this video so many resources teach the syntax but dont take you through actually applying it i loved that not only did you explain the various elements of html and css but you demonstrated it in a fun engaging and easy to understand way that viewers can follow along with i really enjoyed following step by step this is definitely one of those things you learn by doing not just watching ive been playing around with visual studio code all day creating my own little mock websites for fun thank you so much mosh,2
seeing such a smooth colorful and professional tutorial i guess anyone would fall in love with coding mosh youre the best in creating courses,2
i can t believe i learned this in less than a day if i knew you long time ago i would have been a guru by now always scared of coding now you made me love it you are so great thanks a million,2
i am a novice who s transitioning into frontend web development and this is the best tutorial i ve seen well detailed using easy grammar and great explanatory videos thank you so much for this you make it so easy,2
thank you mosh this was a refresher for me as always your tutorials are so friendly and easy to follow along with,2
the fact that i watched all the makeup tutorial without getting bored is unbelievable i love how she s so natural and simple her accent is so beautiful she reminds me of a disney character s love you and keep on,2
she make it looks so easy fast and natural even on smoke colors it looks smooth love it,2
i would wear this to a wedding type thing if i knew it wouldn t over power the brides makeup but that fact i watch this all and i got my makeup out to start to follow is unbelievable,1
i love how she literally explains everything step by step she s so cute,2
girl you re rocking more and more every day soooo beautiful,2
i come from a radiovoiceover background her voice matches exactly how she looks absolutely adorable i find her style of delivery to be quite soothing she should do voiceovers for makeup commercials i could listen to her all day,2
this is amazing you are so confident and it makes the whole video look better just a tip if you wet a qtip just a little bit you can get any mascara or eyeliner smudges off super easily,2
i loved this every single product you use and your applications are flawless definitely watching more of your content,2
i d wear this look everyday i love all your videos,2
the whole look is gorgeous but the eyes are beautiful,2
me picking out my morning eye crust brad i m sure you look incredible,2
i love how brad actually understand what an inch is in meanings of hair months ago i had my hair down to my waist and asked to get inches off my hair he cut off inches and it looked absolutely horrendous i asked for layers and he gave me the choppiest hair you will ever see i cried for days straight and went to school in a ponytail for months,2
hi brad im the girl from the first video i actually ended up getting rid of the colour because it started coming out its now red thank you so much for watching edit for a bit of context this is the account that i watch videos and comment on my main is the one that i post on so please can you stop harassing me,2
brad i dont know what you look like but im sure you look incredible me laying in bed at am with dorito dust on my face and hair unbrushed thanks brad,2
i m really proud of the way that she took notes literally her hair looks adorable on her this is a great style for her the color is really pretty for her complexion even though she may need to do it one more time to hit all those spots,2
you should have your team show you end results of hair and you can guess if it s diy or salon hopefully with fair candidates like not showing off the hair in a salon chair being an obvious giveaway lol,1
my toxic trait is watching these and immediately saying yes i must try this now it turned out great i think wavy hair is so forgiving every time i cut it myself hehe,2
i just did my daughters hair and omg we are both loving it she has curly hair from being biracial and it works so well for her why didnt we do this earlier,2
brads wolf haircut tute was super helpful i havent cut my hair myself in years but i was tired of telling stylists i wanted tons of layers and only getting them at the bottom of my hair so i said fuck it watched his tutorial and went in on my hair with my good shears and thinning scissors best haircut ive had in years so thanks brand mondo,2
i am a retired hairstylist and your videos are very entertaining i did that same haircut back in the s on myself and others it was not called the wolf cut but was called the farah worn by the actress farah fawcett from the show charlies angels i see here it has made a comeback,2
rip to the great legend technoblade,2
these are the ones i would be most likely to use this does not include all of the hacks paper lanterns rusted bridge end rod light park bench mop fish aquarium bird bath walls as walls perfectish circle damaged stone look bridge detailstone buttons pumpkin stem gold treasure chest flowering vines cattail plant glow berry plant pot debug stick basalt and dead coral tree couch pillows custom barrel filled with any block custom jackolanterns small mineshaft scattered envelopes bird s nest crying obsidian effect copper pipes tall candle honey drips computer discreet furnace cooler torch hanging lanterns telescope red stone berries for vines large azalea bush small stream empty bookshelf floating lanterns,1
definetely use the honey block under villager trick its incredibly helpful also i dont know if you can do this but also try doing it with mobs might be helpful when your capturing mobs for something or someone,2
for the glowing eyes one you should use dark oak signs instead of oak ones,1
its cool that both editions have there own features to themselves java with timed combat slab crouching and crawling and bedrock with crossplay potion cauldron armor stand arms and some other stuff that i forgot,2
for anyone else interested on bedrock edition instead of using pistons to make an opened barrel if you open it while going into a nether portal the texture changes to an open barrel,1
i found a really fancy simple and inexpensive chair design you put down a slab on the ground a door on the back trap doors on the sides and of all things a sign post above the slab on the door now this works best with two different wood types but it still looks really cool warped for the sign and slab look best for me also does anyone else see spiders in the black and red tericota or nemo fish in the blue orange taracota might be a story telling ability there might be fun to explore,2
the darker wood underwater technique also works well for showing stepped on vs unused stairs for instance and for paths across rock substitute cobble and gravel to show the wear,2
you can do the same thing to create a coffee table you just have to rotate one of the two part,1
using the campfire smoke and the loom block as a vent use it for a escape room to make it seem like theres gas leaking inside then pair that with pistons to move layers of the roof and shoot poison potions down and you got a good saw map idea maybe use those potion arrow particals to your advantage too,1
not gonna lie gordon ramsay seems like a nice guy teaching us peasants how to cook,2
this is not even on masterclass this man let us learn for free he is the real chad,1
i love how he teaches the right timing to turn the food i usually end up burning it because im afraid of undercooking so its great to get these pro tips,2
i had no idea you had this channel and are making videos teaching all of us for free that s awesome thank you very much mr ramsay,2
im watching this while im sad and honestly hes kinda wholesome i feel like if he was teaching his kids how to cook he would teach them in this manner probably in more advanced recipes since this would be pretty basic to him hes just a dude thats highly passionate about cooking,2
even after all these years hes the most enjoyable chef to watch,2
i enjoyed this lesson very much ive taught music for years and i recognize good teaching loved that you told people to take their time this nurturing technique makes me want to cook and learn new recipes thank you for sharing your immense knowledge,2
ive learned so much from these videos i wasnt a bad cook before but learning a few tricks in slicing things more effectively has made me actually enjoy cooking,2
thank you chef ramsay for sharing your talents with me this has helped me to be better in the kitchen blessings to you and your family,2
what i love about gordon is he shares everything he learned a lot of chefs keep their secrets but he teaches i love it i have cooked almost everything gordon has shown i want to personally thank you bc of you my wife loves me more,2
the minecraft way step build a temporary box house or cave home step after playing for awhile and gathering materials prepare to build your new house step look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration step realize that to accomplish any of those youll need to get x the resources you already have and spend like hours of dedicated building time step stop playing for months step start playing again but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing step decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world step return to step,0
holy gosh i d consider myself to be a pretty good builder but this man s base puts all my years of building to shame amazing job skip,2
here s an extra tip place netherrack in different spots in the ground of the nether portal to make it look like it s spreading into the world,1
step at beginning of the video just extend the room with basic shapes step at end of the video now build an entire warehouse,1
also for the wall facade tip most logs color match the next darkest plank oak logspruce plank spruce logdark oak plank but dark oak log also matches itself,1
just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building this is not the only tutorial you need not even remotely being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics ie what they are and how to execute them you need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter often times even understand things like color theory there is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video especially an minute one but as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it also if you want to get really into building i would recommend watching all of grians tutorials and once youve gotten to a decently advanced level watching tutorials from another far smaller youtuber who goes by horace minecraft he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft in my opinion even better than grian is though they do build in vastly different ways so there isnt much comparison that works there,1
thank you for these tips i m gonna apply these to my dirt house,2
for the farm you could also mix in different crops or place a few flowers in the field tall flowers look the best,2
this is honestly one of the best videos youve made definitely gives a purpose to some of those really bored minecraft players,2
this is the reason why your name is skip the tutorial,1

i can confirm that as a british person we do not all make food that way,1
i love how he tells us what went wrong and how to do it right,2
i love that the narrator is particularly enraged at the horrific cheesecake tutorial usually the narrator performs with an impersonal almost inhumane robotesque anonymity and objectiveness but here you start to see their own real personality come through just a bit whoever they are they must be an avid baker to be so enraged by the british womans baking faux pas hahaha,0
the way that kid tried putting his hair back in to place,1
for the fake blood thing that just had me facepalming so hard i used to work at a haunted house and we went through so much fake blood we just made it with karo clear corn syrup and food coloring sometimes with some grape jelly mixed in and it worked well although obviously quite sticky of course you often would hear some teenagers getting yelled at to stop eating the fake blood,1
as a person living in the uk i can confirm this is an isolated incident i just put the biscuits in a ziplock bag and beat the crap out of them with a rolling pin this lady made me facepalm so bad,0
damn the cheesecake proved the narrator s not just a robot capable of occasionally trying out products he showed actual emotion past making a bad joke followed by i ll see myself out kay you ve done us a great service demonstrating genuine emotion in the be amazed narrator xd,2
that blood clot remark was everything i couldnt stop laughing,2
brilliant i actually laughed out loud the twins trying to spray freckles on was one of the funniest ever thank you so much x,2
as a brit we definitely do not cook like her cheese cake is one of the first things i was taught to make as a child no stove or oven needed,0

except for the eyeliner smudge i think her makeup looks great i was worried it was gonna look too greasy with all the creamsserumsoils but it turned out great,2

love that she s honest about botox filler etc she s very inspiring,2

an essential guide i binned the manual and went through this systematically which was better thank you tony,2
thanks for putting the time for this awesome tutorial tony just switched from nikon to sony full frame and am extremely happy with it cant wait to start my lens collection soon,2
hey tony long time subscriber thank you for all of the content you and chelsea continue to produce i know this video is a few months old but would you consider doing a video comparing the camera picture profiles i am very interested in hlg for sony and it s uses in the real world as well as in the editing booth at the very least are you aware of any resources for luts that help convert back to rec,2
i just bought the ar i want to thank you a billion times for helping me tremendously i used this tutorial from your ar and in some cases some of the stuff i had to move around a bit to find because sony has moved it in the menus but i will for sure be getting a good nights sleep tonight thanks to you just became a full time subscriber thank you thank you thank you,2
thanks tony great tutorial learned a lot more than the time i played with a k and a coming from an apsc to this camera i was a little skeptical would be able to learn and use all features of my new a r but your tutorial made it so easy that i find myself more familiar with a r than the previous cropped ones thanks again and cheers,2
thank you so very much for this long detailed very accurate tutorial im a professional photographer who just upgraded to the a r and you have just saved me probably a year worth of learning the camera thank you very much love the channel keep up the good work,2
youre amazing i usually chuck the manual away and freestyle and explore my camera instead but today i sat through minutes of you guiding me and ive learned so much the only reason why i stopped is because its getting late and i need to sleep,2
time stamps intro head structure eyes noses lips eyebrows shading examples,1
she draw a circle me ok my hand how about an egg,1
im motivated at a wrong time my will to do sketches again really went when im on the busiest days of my life,0
just in case anyone is wondering this technique of drawing heads is called the loomis method you can research more into it and enhance drawing portraits i personally love this technique myself thank you for sharing this po,2
i ve watched so many face drawing tutorials and this one is the only one that actually helped all of a sudden my faces look realistic and proportions fit thank you,2
so underrated thats so sadur skills r absolutely definitely and totally amazing,2
enjoying your tutorials a stress reliever after online classes,2
she does the work piece by piece from the sketch to the nose the eyes and the mouth this is how you really learn to draw this video really is one of the best to learn,2
oh myy i was hoping youd do a face tutorial your techniques are always so easy to follow along with and help a lot,2
this was crazy i used different colors for the different lines for each thing like the nose was florescent orange the circles for the skull were turquoise the sunglasses area for the eyes were hot pink and the box for the mouth is grass green then i did as you did and used black to put in the features oh the shoulders and neck on the one from the side are turquoise it sounds like it would be a huge mess but i used the colors to make key saying what color is for what structure and hmmmmif i keep practicing this i will gain so much so fast and i eat shading out aside from some hair she looks bonkers but as long as i understand it hey my sketchbook is colorful,1
never thought i d see t day where gq would post a waves tutorial,0

the fact that gf is teaching bf instead of letting he do all by himself is really wholesome in my opinion,2
this girlfriend is more supportive than everyone ive met in my life,2

the ending is like dont worry girl i got this,2
the fact that at the boyfriend does something by himself is just so wholesome and cute,2

so happy to help inspire you hailey love the final look,2
i love how she didn t shove her brand down our throat in this like most people do when they have new beauty brands can t wait to get my hands on some of the products,2
i love how supportive she is of her friends and their brands i love that she uses ari and kylies make up products it warms my heart to see women supporting other women,2
i loved her and i love her even more now shes been consistent with expressing her knowledge towards skin care shes incorporating it within her line and grew with it over the years im just proud,2
she s so beautiful with and without makeup it s so nice to see a young celebrity that doesn t look overdone with the fillers and plastic surgeries i think she has a gorgeous face and skin and also she has this vibe that seems so nice and so down to earth,2
her skin is unbelievable not just in this video but over the years every picture of her i notice her skin she seems very sweet too,2
she s so well spoken and so elegant yet down to earth i see why jb married her she referred to him as my husband which was very classy as well she didn t name drop her husband what a gem of a woman,2
i love that she used her own products but didnt talk about it for mins and just introduced them like all of the other products that she used i love her so much what a queen,2
her skin is literally perfect shes so passionate about self care skin care makes sense why she chose to start the skin care brand instead of makeup i absolutely love her skin congratulations on rhode hailey,2

good to see more people teaching juggling here on youtube,2
me standing here with the tennis balls i bought specifically to learn to juggle with,1
hey just wanna let you know i used your tutorials to learn and now weeks later i can almost perfectly juggle about times still a long way to go but really amazing tutorials and it was a lot of fun the journey thanks a lot,2
ive never been able to juggle more than two things in my whole life until now taylor makes it so easy to understand great tips thank you so much self esteem improved pts,2
hey taylor it s been a while since i watched this video i was talking to joe dinoto and he said i should let you know that you are the reason i can juggle today your explanations are great and it was something i always thought were just beyond my ability so thank you and please keep up the amazing work,2
i really like the way you teach got my juggling balls now i m going to start practicing by the way i am years old and i want to do this to keep my brain working well,2
thank you really much a great thing to learn during lockdown times,2
thanks really clear instructions with great does and donts im finally learning to actually juggle at years old,2
thank you so much for your videos taylor juggling has always helped me deal with anxietykeeps my mind focused its awesome to learn some new tricks thank you for the inspiration you give,2
the education edition is also a part of the pocket and bedrock edition this means that mobile bedrock players can play education edition without paying more than what minecraft actually costs it is a world setting i love it,2
the border blocks are also available outside of education edition at least in bedrock they are and are accessible through the give command,1
the feature i love most about education edition is the chalkboards they are so much easier to type on give you more room to type and you can go back and edit them,2
mannn i really wish theyd bring some of these awesome items over to the java edition colored torches and sparklers balloons plus there are pocket edition items i wish theyd bring over too,2
back when i used pocket edition i used a lot of these glad to know they re being recognized,2
glad to see education is getting some attention sure it s the version made for learning but it has probably some of the best map making features out of all minecraft versions,2
i used to play mcee in school all the time before the pandemic even though my teacher probably hated me and all the kids that played games during class i couldnt help but notice all the anazing things in this version of minecraft i basically forgot all about it until i watched this video it was basically free as its obtainable to anyone with a school laptop the laptops were on a lan so wed be able to join other players worlds like parkour hungergames or minigames,2
i actually think that blaze rods could be used with glow ink sacs to make glow sticks if javabedrock were to have them,2
ed edition is so good its just sad that it doesnt get much recognition online also the agent can be used as a portable inventory by spawning it placing the items in its inventory and then you can despawn it or just leave it then resummon it later,2
from what i know these features are also available in bedrock edition its optimizedyou can get all features of education edition in desktoplaptoppc devices but in mobile you can get most items but not all like the camera portfolio are not there,1

not to shade anyone but being latina im glad to have some representation in the form of alexa maybe because i really admire her but i can relate more with her in the sense shes not the typical latina bombshell shes still a bombshell and one of the most sensual and confident women ive seen and i really like how shes connected to her feminity love her authenticity as well,2

i am years old and i am going to moonwalk now this is the best video ever for how to moonwalk cheers buddy brilliant thanks for the lesson,2
the best kind of tutorial is where you make the person both feel capable and excited to train the move this accomplishes that in abundance awesome work,2
if i learn this you ll never see me walking forward again,0
youve really focused on the essentials of the technique that helped so much ive tried to learn with other tutorials before but didnt seem to make any progress minutes with you and i got it it worked at once thank you,2
mihran i am sooooo happy i could do the moonwalk your explanation is very precise and easy big thanks from the bottom of my heart,2
hey thats a really great tutorial minutes is all it took thank you,2
for the first glitch there is an easier way put any leaves on jungle leaves and then just look through the top leaves,1
a more effective way for villagers to return at night is an automatic bell alarm using night sensors with linked with a timer that rings thrice it kinds of really reminds me of a clock that has curfew regulations,1
there has to be a factory that generates these ideas consistent uploads each with completely different topics woah,1
that glass panebeacon thing was neat i liked that though i find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general i kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam i know vanilla tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me but that doesnt mean everyone isnt seeming my base just surrounded in beams maybe they could make tinted glass function as a beam nullifier while still maintaining effects thatd be nice,2
ive been using the door trick for years had a base entrance that used it once only problem is since they added crawling if you dont time it right you get sandwiched under the top block of the door,0
well its actually smart to carry around doors in case you want to mine underwater and you dont have respiration and aqua affinity on your helmet,1
this was an incredible video i didnt know about glass instead of dead coral fan or mud for sugar cane thank you so much,2
idk why people dont place the glass in sugar cane farms above the water it prevents items from falling there and it can save a few hoppers,1
i started using mud for sugar cane purely for aesthetics didnt realize it had other uses for sugar cane farms,2
this man is a genius he never runs out of ideas lol,2
what do you think is your brain hurting dont forget there are subtitles available,2
being german and listening to dutch be like i understand no i dont yes i do no i dont,1
as a belgian who speaks dutch when ive seen her speak english she felt like a big celebrity but when watching this video she felt like the girl next door to me,1
wow me being afrikaans and from south africa understands every word of her dutch its actually a very very similar language just like a different accent amaizing,2
hands up who got this in their recommended because of eurovision btw you were a fantastic host nikkie,2
for those who think that she is speaking dutch with an english accent you should know that dutch and english are actually came from the same root besides german and yiddish,1
me doesn t watch makeup videos me doesn t know a word in dutch me sees the title me clicks instantly and watches the whole thing,0
dutch makeup tutorial of what she says consists of beauty products having english names,1
when i first started watching your videos i never knew you were dutch i thought you were american it amazes how well you speak english with no accent that is just wow ive always wanted to learn dutch because i think it is a very under rated language that deserves to be more attention in the world,2
wat ben jij toch een prachtig mens ieder keer als ik jouw video zien moest ik ook lachen zo leuk om jouw te zien en te horen je lacht is zo aanstekelijk jij bent een topper nikkie,1

that kool aid clip was hilarious i love how the drink up gobbles up the sugar like an addict with the thick mixture bubbling over like a witchs cauldron the sugar just got swallowed up in an instant in such a weird way,2
i love how you give an explanation after he can video that s logical well researched and fact checked that s what makes you a great content creator love your channel,2
the koolaid one i remember seeing a while back and i loved it its almost comical seeing that heavy block of sugar slowly sinking down to bubble underneath,2
the henna freckle one looked alright once she put foundation on i have a ton of face freckles and it looks just about the same depending on how much makeup i apply,2
i dont know why we humans feel better when other people failbut watching these hilarious tutorials go wrong kinda puts me in a good mood,2
yeah she should ve tested the henna before because henna usually stays for a week few days depends how long you keep it on for or how much you apply i also think that instead of rubbing it off paper she should ve washed her face every time i get henna done on my hands i wash my hands i don t wipe it off some people wipe it off too but wiping is better for your hands when you apply henna you should wash your face maybe cause she didn t wash her face it turned out like or maybe because she should ve just tested it out,1
at work we love watching kays cooking my boss is a really good cook and watching her reaction to lay screwing up is the best,2
i really like your sense of dry humor it reminds me my mechanics teacher he has an explanation of something suddenly he puts in a joke doesnt laugh at it and continues to see as if nothing happened,2
i watch it million time and i don t know how to do it i almost broke my arm out,0

a lot of the newer ones have reallyreally cool secrets one i was playing even hadsomewhat far away under watera sunken version of one of the old tutorial worlds,2
i don t remember the tutorial world looking like that i just remember the whole thing being the castle with a farm to the right along with the starter house the red stone area and the pond of course,1
i miss the good old days before mojang became extremely lazy and restrictive,0
i remember this but also the tutorial map for the ps these maps are iconic,2
i remember going outside of the tutorial area and finding a disk apparently there are disks scattered across in different areas,1
bro i loved playing this and then after loving it so much i found out you could skip the tutorial and loved it even more,2
this brings back so many memories i remember i used to play on this world since i was years old and now i am in college,2
i feel like you become a minecraft veteran when you have been around for more updates than you havent been for like i feel luke thats the official milestone,2

im surprised td ameritrade was fidelity gives the best execution in my experience for nonoption trades and free trades interactive brokers provides fast order execution but you have to pay fees if you are a trader robinhood is by far the worst excessive pof others use pof but not to the extreme of robinhood,0
robinhood is severely underrated,0
webull has amazing features robinhood front runs their orders,2
interest rates go up people spend less businesses and peoples loan costs go up the sad thing about inflation is that even when you get it under control the damage is done and those prices never go back down i m putting all of my profits into silver gold bitcoin ethereum and food,0
robin hood made it possible to trade for free if it wasn t for them they would still be charging us to place trades,1
that s why you do a limit order and never a market order quite a misleading story the assumption is that retail traders don t know how to place a trade with a limit order,0
i wonder if this is only for market price or does it include limit buys,1
why would they not use limit trades should be common sense for any stock trader skews their data using market trades only,1
ameritrade is the best,2
bajaj finance is a gem indeed,2

im glad i got into crypto when i did because it s been a turning point for me financiallybeen my best decision so far,2
thanks for the update and keep doing what you do my journey in the current market has taught me a lot of lessons at the top of that list is that it never pays to live above ones means i have managed to grow a nest egg of around k to a decent figures in the space of a few months sad to say but a lot of us have poor money management skills my cents get an advisor to keep you accountable and aid you make better decisions carolyn halles has been helping me a lot all through my journey i find it better to pay a little bit more for peace of mind than worry about money or market trends and still get burned,2
when it comes to investing we want our money to grow with the highest rates of return and the lowest risk possible while there are no shortcuts to getting rich but there are smart ways to go about it,2
the last two years was also the worst time to buy real estate its met it bubble peak though and will take some time to resettle,0
homes are being way overvalued time for sellers to come down to reality,0
this painful plateau of economic misery will continue for years there are too many forces propping up the market itll never get back down to the average person anymore because the institutional money will grab much of the property before it does there are also so many more options for homeowners than simply selling now sideways for years to come and the next generations go downhill hopefully it was worth the greed of the asset bubble the fed created,0
not a great time for buyers right up until prices crash and blackrock comes in and sweeps em all up on the cheap in cash homeowners that cant pay an absurd mortgage can rent for exorbitant rates after they boost the prices back up you will own nothing and you will not be happy,0
we needed a real estate expert to tell us this why thank you so much mr expert,2
real estate will just be one of the dead markets tied to the collapse of everything though,0
sorry for people who paid or k more than the asking price in the last years,0
as a brookfield shareholder definitely not happy theyre investing to hard into intel of all the companies,0

intel is in trouble,0
if you listen to what he says it s even crazier reduce payments from of income to but it will automatically pay itself off in years so basically it s going to incentivize colleges to charge more,1
someone making more than k per year does not need a hand out from people making less than k a year asinine,1
economics increasing the supply of money increases inflation of the time this is horrible news for the stock market and the economy as a whole biden lost my vote and while i hate trump im no longer sure how ill vote in the next election,0

this is so regressive fjb,0
great content i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over btc when i started at btc in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from alex gomez i would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,2
that pie chart is what happens when you flunk your math classes,0
transfer of wealth usually occur during recession so the more stocks drop the more i buy in the meanwhile im just focused on making better investments and earning more as recession fear increases apparently there are strategies to x gains in this present market because i read of someone that pulled a profit of k within months what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist,1
whoever made that chart at should be fired,0
who did the pie chart and who put it as thumbnail,1
these guys must of did the trump clinton surveys the pie graph adds up to and some how is bigger than,1
something clearly wrong on that pie chart,0
i m so opportune that irrespective of the economy crisis and financial conditions i am still able to earn returns from my initial every days crypto investment is the really profitable,2
that has to be the worst representation in a graph ever public,0

what are your thoughts on being an energy independent nation what are your thoughts on nuclear energy wbf university join my school here,1
the two major nuclear disasters happened because of incompetence chernobyl and natural disaster fukushima as a british citizen i would say that on the most part we are very capable of preventing those two things we ve wasted years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion let s get those plants running baby,0
i think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza the system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos its a huge engineering lift it takes years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of years instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders and now the chickens are coming home to roost,0
germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy their co emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence personally i am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer but without the emissions renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclearfossil fuels i would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants using the same small plots of land with renewable it requires covering vast amounts of land with solarwind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is windsolar this land should be used for farming or nature preserves not renewables if the solar is using worthless land such as the desert maybe it makes senses but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaningmaintenance needed due to the dust offshore wind also resolves the land use problem but the costs of maintaining s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties,1
this was known by literally every nation in the world if youre dependent on other nations you are subject to their whims most important of all is food and energy independence looks at eu moves to remove food independence as well hmm you know when you remove others independence you are supposed to make them dependent on you you arent supposed to weaken yourself,1
nuclear is a great carbonfree base load electricity source i d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio on the downside nuclear is expensive to build and insure but the actual watts generated are among the cheapest there are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors and it seems like we ll have enough of it for years if we generate of the energy from nuclear on top of that thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors th gen which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run making initial investment lower they would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid,1
so impressed marko has made a video regarding energy use in the eu it is useful to view the data from just a futures point of view which is how companies plan on future availability way to keep up the good work marko btw nuclear energy has been overlooked for the last years and needs to come back it is sad how german and french embraced nuclear energy then pulled back which leaves them open to the crisis now america should take heed,1
excellent video marko things look really bad for now just recently it was reported that germans among many others probably already spend their savings to fight inflation instead of having their salaries rise to cover it i dont want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase or when those savings run out,0
great video again marko you did a great job sadly the netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos in addition i can tell that after the fukushima nuclear incident in march the eu banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second chernobyl incident the thru regulations coal was stamped as dirty and gas was the second best option after nuclear power if we go back into history the north european countries the netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages since there wasnt a need to change and gas was promoted after the perfect storm was created now there is need so the coal and nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need from my point of view these things should change nuclear is the way to go create a military security perimeter around nuclear power plants the western world shouldnt be working with russia nor china for energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability furthermore the ecb cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them pigs portugal italy greece spain and with this structural inflation problems russia knows this and the ecb messed up big time last but not least the eu but also the usa canada australia and japan need to stop applying qe start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming to years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable thanks again marko,2
hi marko im living in the germany not born though and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis honestly as a european i feel quite disappointed by everything i understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after fukushima accident but on the other hand i cannot understand how they didnt invest in other resources or should i say how the europe especially germany didnt diversify when it comes to energy suppliers its like you said they just ignored that fact even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with russia,0

inflations getting crazy i m gonna have to start cutting down on things like making payments soon,0
things are going to get a lot worse i can t see a way out of this your liberal government is more concerned with ukraine they haven t done anything to help you a canadian keep voting the same way and get the same results,0
im concerned about the federal government sending workers to sneak into saskatchewan and trespass on private property then theres the sending mps to taiwan to stir the war pot also did anyone else notice the very enthusiastic greeting deputy tweak gave the german chancellor she know hes probably only here to have a hot shower,0
as inflation soars and the economy slows be sure to thank your local liberal member of parliament or your local ndp member of parliament because inflation is the direct result of liberal federal government monetary policy with such policies shamelessly supported by the ndp,0
and this is the problem with voting and hiring on the basis of diversity,0
imagine if trudeau had invested the ukraine into his own country maybe the healthcare system,1
don t forget to get your booster shots it s only weeks to flatten the curve we re all in this together and once we are all poor and bankrupt we re going to build back better wake up canada and start taking accountability and responsibility for your own situations,1
lol government give corporations that are making record profits more money for canadians childcare is the fix for inflation give me a break governments are there to screw the small guy get another job step off,0

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over btc with btcfrom day tradng with jacob carlson insights and chartshis been one step ahead of other analysis you can reach mr jacob carlson on ei mjacobcarlson,0

when this episode came out bitcoin was around for a giant zuccini is outrangous,1
this is the best video in the series so far straightforward easy to follow and no political stalking horses,2
you guys are so awesome one of the most boring subjects has changed into one of the most interesting ones thank you,2
i appreciate the service you are performing for others with your videos thank you please keep it up,2
i love this channel for giving so much information about something that i am interested in,2
i like that you made this so easy to understand and process thank you,2
a minor correction bitcoin is not anonymous it is pseudonymous all transactions that have ever occurred since bitcoins inception is permanently recorded on the public worldwide ledger therere no names and identities associated with each transaction but it doesnt mean someone cant figure out who made those transactions with some research in fact there are already tools to help assist with this given that fact using bitcoins for illicit transactions is ill advised fiat cash like dollars and euros is better suited for that purpose,1
omg love this thanks for actually speaking at a rate that i can follow other videos are edited and sliced together so tightly that it has no pauses in between sentences for the information to sink in,2
i am new to the stock market every stock that i bought so far i was out of luck because i bought them when they were expensive i feel i missed out on all the stock opportunities so far for the tech stocksi believe having k yearly income would be a good investment so i want to plug all my savings into the stock market i know this sounds a bit dull but i would like to know if i should learn investing or let somebody else more capable like a fa do it for me please share your thoughts i am kind of tired of searching for a good stock to buy and losing all the good opportunities,0
with the way the market is moving well mostly hold for longer than to realize profit gain i think a video on how to profit from the present market will be more effective i mean ive heard of people making upto k within few months and id like to know how,1
i am which is old for a crypto investor i fomod in heavily in didnt have a clue made many stupid mistakes but was lucky and still made nice gains i kept btc eth in my bag and would have enough to quadruple that amount on a decent drop i recently decided alice marcella take on the market makes sense so im following her lead will i be upset if she is wrong and i totally missed the bottom absolutely not because she actually made a lot of profit for me and i m still trading with her till date i would advise yall to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you arent sure about,2
when you have high interest rates environment its logical to buy consumer staples and not discretionary because people consumers will buy what they need certain products wont be affected much especially if they are highly priced which means that they are for high earners this is especially important for a company called apple important to know product pricing and the consumer,2
how away from work but still earning good cash all with the help of mr richard friedman trading with you is an awesome experience in the stock market and cryptocurrency as well,2
yahoo going into overdrive trash talking ryan i can smell that they are scared,0
great insight man trying to make sense of the crypto market structure can be pretty daunting for a complete noob investor regardless of the market disposition whats most attractive is the possibility of making portfolio changing returns i was opportune to meet stacy huth and her exceptional knowledge of the market saved me from inherent losses and have so far earned me over btc in the last quarter what a time to be alive indeed,2
with the way things are moving i think i need to see a video on how to survive amidst the present recession i mean everything is in shambles surprisingly i heard people still make over k within a few months and id like to know how and if it is still possible in these times or if i am being lazy,0
burned,2
yes could have told you this was coming in feb i work in the industry i know how stretched people have been the last few years and with rates moving into even the high s that it was lights out wait till they re in the mid s,1
the sad thing about inflation is that even when you get it under control the damage is done and those prices never go back down the market won t crash until after the midterms i m putting all of my profits into silver gold bitcoin ethereum and food,0
but i thought that we didnt have enough houses i thought demand was so high the money money money would keep coming,0
my opinion depending on location and what happens with all the foreclosure notices that are starting to pop up it is either heading into a correction or possibly a crash def not easy to predict,0
when you ask to percent higher price then years ago thats what gonna happen,1
my portfolio is always growing be fearless when others are scared warren buffet famously stated longterm investments should be made and patience is a virtue because the stock market always rebounds,2

seriously,1
owning quality dividend stocks are the best dividends are higher,2
that was a mic drop moment right there heck yea transitory sounds like forward guidance to me income inequality is also a huge problem our government needs to do something about but lacks the will to do so now the entire economy will suffer because of not taking care of our less advantaged in society,0
economists like to look at the journey and are very rationale one step here one step there financial markets look at the terminal value destination and ask themselves what does the destination look like and can i get there first,1
it has been awesome really crypto is very frustrating i was astonish how i made with k as a novice i got to put in some in it tho,2
the only good thing is that powell seems to be more level minded than predaccesors and it looks like he will raise interest rates aggressively based on his discussions he seems determined to get inflation under control irrespective of falling asset values he might just be the knight in shining armour who comes to the rescue just at the right time although he messed up with inflation peaking he is the only one who makes sense at the fed,2
we are already in the big crash inflation is a catastrophe this cpi report is a colossal failure to bring the housing market to a halt the fed will have to pull all the stops the unfortunate issue is that other markets are being decimatedif you want to stay green you have to rely on a lot of diversification currently up and being careful still a better deal than leaving it in a savings or checking account yielding percent interest,0
eerian on tv again telling you another fed mistakes and economic doom,0
at the end he speaks about youth unemployment as the precepts of generational poverty he is correct that is why mayor marion barry youth summer jobs program was so transformative work builds ethics confidence and saves you from wasted idle time like scrolling tiktok all summer,2

i hold high respect for your work mate because youre pointing people in the right direction if theres one thing ive learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in cryptocurrency lets not panic and sell when when everything goes down and do not buy in euphoria when everything goes up i advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses the trade market is unstable and you cant easily tell if its going bullish or bearish while myself and my colleagues are trading without fear of incurring loses others are being patient for the price of skyrocket it all depends on the pattern you follow thanks to mitnickcorporg for her trading tips shes the best broker ive ever come across,1
extremely point by point video well i will also say this here most people dont understand the concept of buying the dip buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises holding is great although trading is far more profitable i was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt assets early enough but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market all that changed when i encountered mitnickcorp i must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of mitnickcorporg that has made me over good oin,1

the market has been pretty bad until today it decided to surge everybody was practically crying then it kept dipping thats what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own big thank to mrs josphine leela im not bothered with how bad the market is because my assests are insured due to her advice and i still receive my profits,1
if he buys the club his first job is to get rid and replace people in charge of recruitment at the club get people who are experienced and not just former players in that role,1
i can hear the we want ratcliffe chant as a united fan a selfmade working class roots billionaire who lived miles from old trafford supporting united being a united owner you couldnt write the script its unbelievable,0
im all for it honestly imo the amount of money were in debt they should either have to pay back or deduct it from their own valuation of the club,1
buying a minority stake will change nothing for the fansthe glazers will still have the power to milk the club for all its worth while investing nothing backthe stadiumtraining facilities and most importantly squad are all need of a huge makeover and only a new controlling owner can do that,1
if mu fans really want the glazes out you have to hurt them where they care the most money boycott the club commercial sell and their sponsors lower their tv broadcast viewsstadium attendancesocial media activity ratings etc all these together will brought down the valuation of the club really weaken the glazess position and help potential buyers protest along is meaningless before that i doubt anything will happen,0
as jr said he is not dumb money i have been a fan for a long time and remember united when they werent winning i think the fans wanting to oust the glaziers have a feeling of entitlement winning and losing are cyclical that is something that needs to be accepted,1
the glazers have said theyre only willing to sell a minority stake nothing will change for utd unless its a full takeover,1
this puts things to bed imo however the fact that ratcliffe openly made this statement may prompt them into a potential sale after all sponsors and partners are starting to have cold feet and that would definitely push them out especially if as expected our season goes pear shaped,0
glazers will not sell until the value of the brand manchester united depreciates from a financial point united s brand value is far superior compared to others united can easily fetch billion if put up for a sale so unless the brand value is affected things won t change glazers have proved that brand value is not affected by on field performances the occasional noise and drama associated with united will be enough to keep it rolling,1
im and my wife and i are very worried about our future gas and food prices rising daily we have had our savings dwindle with the cost of living into the stratosphere and we are finding it impossible to replace them we can get by but cant seem to get ahead my condolences to anyone retiring in this crisis years nonstop just for a crooked system to take all you worked for,0

in the aftermath of the recent asian financial crisis many blamed international institutions corruption governments and flawed macro and microeconomic policies not only for causing the crisis but also unnecessarily lengthening and deepening it at the turn of this century most economists in the developed world believed that major economic disasters were a thing of the past or at least relegated to volatile emerging markets financial systems in rich countries the thinking went were too sophisticated to simply collapse,0
when it comes to investing we want our money to grow with the highest rates of return and the lowest risk possible while there are no shortcuts of getting rich but there are smart ways to go about it,2

although i have interests in global economics i dont watch the news anymore i have enough fud lol thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate timesevents like this youre right about keeping level headed when investing so thats why i think its important to limit the amount of fud we consume i dont watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if i were to watch the news everyday now i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over btc from day trading with shirley bagshaw signal in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1

dude thinks wage increases are the cause of inflation when it has been massively under inflation and people are being payed less value year after year since the s they mass printed haulted production and services filled their balance sheets and took on massive amounts of debt wage increases are a result of dilution not the cause,0
to reach your potential you need to start doing investing remains the smartest way to prepare for the unexpected been in the space for yrs and extremely pleased with the decision i made the good news is it s not too late,2
if inflation stay at current level soon or later the bond market will collapse then following will be the collapse of stock market there is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level this is the effect of years of horrific monetary policy qe too much stimulus the fed added trillions of debt to it balance sheet since and all the plans to reduce it deficit have failed and in the contrary they continue to increase the deficit each year they can blame the ukraine war or covid that caused inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy made by the central government over decades the only question left is how much tightening they can do without causing a hard recession in an already vulnerable economy,0
learning from the professionals thank you,2
economys fine no cause for concern just like in right the problem is the economy is a mess because the money supply and fiscal policy is too loose but the economy is now dependent on a loose money supply and loose fiscal policy just to function so no matter what you do nothing tighten or loosen the economy suffers,0

what was your favorite personal finance tip from the video,1
having money doesn t necessarily make you happy but not having money will make you miserable,0
great content in your channel i m and my wife and i reached m net worth in five years later it s m our yearly salary is a little over k we drive older cars cook at home eat leftovers and have in college we saved for college and our boys help by working they will graduate debt free,2
freeing your mind from consumerism is so important were literally trained from young to always want more to never be satisfied to compare ourselves to our neighbors and what they have i was always a natural saver but struggled a bit in not comparing myself to others its still something i work on but over time have gotten better it definitely helped that i realized the image others put forward the majority of the time is financed by debt thats not something im interested in at all i hope more people learn this concept and actively practice it ill definitely talk about it on my channel as well,2
too many people spend money they havent earned to buy things they dont want to impress people that they dont like will rogers,0
pay yourself first save for emergencies spend less save more lose a habit gain some savings,1
we need to be teaching personal finance in schools and the idea that enough is enough needs to spread like wildfire,1
financial freedom debt savings compound spending experiences vs stuff stuff new road map,1
retiring early is possible but tough it definitely requires discipline and big sacrifices it s not only about saving the huge step is boosting earning capacity the stock market and real estate are by far the most profitable my portfolio has experienced,2
i think what brings more happiness is to work for a purpose that makes us feel bigger than our need for survival a sense of belonging to something greater than ourselves instead of working for money,2
the finance minister of tn is more intelligent than of them combined,2
such a shameless bjp cant even answer the question asked and blabbering something else,0
thats not arrogance its called self respect,1
you call it arrogance we tamilians proudly call it as intelligence,1
respect doubled for ptr sir tamilnadu is land of intelligents and hard working people ptr sir is a clear example,2
ptr is hundred times in brilliance and in performance than modi and sitaraman excellent speach by tn finance minister a well educated and well known economist we need leaders like him to counter false narratives indian leaders become arrogant the power centers enjoy every thing free for life time from air to airplanes what about the poor,2
i am from jharkhand i liked dr ptrs so called arrogance we need more such educated ministers whole tn must be proud of him,2
not arrogance but boldness to speak out the fact naked truth i dream the day dr thyagarajan becoming indias finance minister,2
bjp needs to be educated in almost everything by tn that is the current status full stop,0
tn has performed better than the central government in every metric so bjp and their government should stop giving advice to other people,1

funny enough the argument that bitboys business is advice is incredibly dangerous for him coming from someone who is actually registered to give financial advice there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice and what you can say if thats your business needless to say bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front normally youtubers are protected from liability because their business youtube technically isnt advicebased admitting your business is advicebased though might open you up to liability im not a lawyer but i know a bit about the legality of financial advice happy to touch base if it would help,0
this is terrible glad you re going to fight back and i really hope that you get the result that you deserve if he hadn t hurt his brand before this alone is going to damage it completely now and it ll be his own fault entirely,0
imagine being a scammer and get hurt because someone points it out were with you you will win this,0
the delivery was definitely illegal and unprofessional we all love you atozy we all truly hope you win you have much evidence going for you this dirt bag shouldn t win,0
dude bold of him to say he now suffers from emotional distress when he himself caused you to vomit out of stress this whole ordeal must be a nightmare my heat goes out to you buddy and i wish you the best of luck,0
i dont often spend money for a youtuber as i dont have much but i will donate this time its absolutely ridiculous you are getting sued for voicing your opinions you deserve to be able to defend yourself,0
jesus thats fucking shameful bitboy this is intimidation plain and simple im happy youre standing up for yourself like this atozy stay positive,0
this fits the definition of a slapp suit strategic lawsuits against public participation or strategic litigation against public participation are lawsuits intended to censor intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition,0
hey erling paralegal here i saw the end of your video but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit lawsuits are not fun in any way unless your the attorneyfirm and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress my parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always moreover if the other side has an attorney they have the advantage of knowing how the system works such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase rule a dislcosures interrogatories evidence you intend to use at trial depositions of plaintiffs defendants and expert witnesses etc and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge i truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself just be careful with how you proceed pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done also remember its a legal system and not a justice system this is not legal advice just a concerned fan lawyers or other legal professionals please correct anything i may have overlookedunintentionally misconstrued ps i think the service the guy who threw the papers at you rudely was fine unfortunately you identified yourself once that happens they can just leave it at your doorstep,0
scammersbots are getting much worse they are using my name and logo in comments to trick you do not ever send money to someone from the comments or dms be careful,0
hey austin i thoroughly enjoyed this video the content you and your brother aaron provide is tremendous i find value every time i watch and just wanted to thank you guys,2
i like btc and eth but real money will be made with guardentoken thank me later,2
why should we choose between gold standard or bitcoin standard i want to have it all at once gold bitcoin silver if we are squeezed in one standard the risk to be gamed is infinite high,0
this video is thank you austin love the bitcoin and eth videos,2
i love bitcoin,2
pow with the merge coming up it would be great to get a high level overview cryptos miners will potentially move to ergo flux raven etc,2
bitcoin is only durable if there is electricity and network connections in times of crisis and in many places around the world these things are unreliable also if keys are lost the bitcoins associated with them are gone forever,0

a chaque fois que je me connecte une de tes vid o y a de plus en plus d abonn s signe de qualit a,2
merci boss t attends quel niveau de repli pour rempiler,2
superbe vid o comme d habitude juste l ico du cosmos c tait merci pour le taf,1
toujours des bonn conseils merci,1
merci beaucoup,2
un grand merci pour cet pr sentation,1
thanks to all your support bitboy just announced he s dropping the lawsuit presumably due to the backlash and financial support to atozy,2
yeah this is so insane the lawsuit is super laughable lmao,0
big congratulations to bitboy guy managed to expose himself on a massive scale,2
the defamation suit made his image worse lmao had no idea who he was till the lawsuit and now all i do is laugh at the man child,0
amazing to see you supporting atozy looks like hes having a real tough time with it,2
some people are just too sue happy hurt feelings from people stating opinions dont count bro he definitely stepped wrong on this because now someone like me who has zero interest in crypto because of excessive cynicism knows about him and knows to steer clear he did this not atozy or coffeezilla he put his reputation on the line instead of ignoring it and letting it roll off his back,0
he always sues everyone hes a well known scammer who gets paid to promote crypto scams hes got a reputation,0
can t wait seeing him under oath asked how much money he s taken to promote scams he s digging his own grave on this one,0
well done in lending your support to atozy im sure you will help him in what ever he needs to fight this case like the obvious inconsistencies in his evaluation of his business,2
correct me if i m mistaken but by filing a lawsuit claiming defamation doesn t he open himself to discovery after all it s actually his own reputation that will be on trial could be entertaining,1
hope you guys enjoyed this update dont forget that you can get the content that you are missing here on my other social channels you also need to subscribe to my clips channel which has shorter market updates and livestreams,2
these videos are infinitely more helpful than the talking heads on cnbc keep up the great work guy always look forward to these,2
i m a huge fan of you branching out into larger economics and not just crypto these videos are great,2
congrats guy you have metamorphed from a crypto knowledge expert to geopolitical expert great thoughts hope the chinese people are able to view this,2
great video guy love how you are diversifying and showing all sides of the economy instead of just crypto and you give other reporters a good run for their money guy do you think it doesnt matter how bad the chinese economy gets since the global village is slowly decoupling and when its all said and done china still has a substantial manifacturing base whereas the western manufacturing base has been mostly hollowed out i mean the west is mostly a service economy and not a manufacturing whats your prognosis,2
thank you guy i really appreciate the broader financial global economic perspective that your channel is pursuing beyond crypto your videos are always top notch full of logical insight entertaining and perfectly concise we appreciate all that you do,2
you re doing great with the geopolitical news please continue to keep us update on what s going on around the globe,2
great content as always i really appreciate the broader perspective and that the information is provided in a calm and matter of fact fashion without sensationalism i get much more insight from this than traditional media but i really missed the usual intro,2
guy long term follower here and financial risk manager with y experience i think you missed with this video while i agree that the risks are certainly there given the government power and the fact current interest rates in china are far higher then the west they have far more room to manoeuvre them self out of this crisis great content as always keep up the good work team coin bureau,2
thanks for this kind of macro finance videos extremely important for all markets,2
guuuyssss the official binance dex has a bug it exchanges the bitcoinethereum pair for x i made video,0

excellent workimpeccable explanation and remarkable didactics thank you very much for contributing to the understanding of those of us who have little knowledge about crypto i really appreciate the content of this video but still i find it difficult to trade how do i go about it in bitcoin,2

check out the next episode of cnbc s crypto world,1
i appreciate the content you put out on youtube i enjoy watching your videos i respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public you may be right on this trade but if you are right you better also short the us market as well because if the chinese market collapses it will pull down the us market with it thanks buddy previously bitcoin has been fluctuating between the k and k price marks billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price particularly in the last four weeks the loss has become the primary cause of several firms liquidation issues in the crypto industry i think the direction is upward movement with a bit of silence before the storm agree its boring for the past few days a good strategy for hoddlerss moving forward would be to buy now and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn the rise will surprise everyone as for traders you make money anyways in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions if you re a modern investor then your main aim i guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility well goodnews you don t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with mrs robin moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you i have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop btc with btc with her trade signal despite the state of the market her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions the good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market for helpguidance on buildinginvestingfinancial portfolio ei m moorerobin,2
your channel has truly changed my life ive been studying and researching about crypto for a while now and i got stuck at some point on the learning curve now i can say im truly improving my understanding of this whole new world and making great profit weekly all thanks to you,2
i came here to learn how to invest after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made in months from k somehow this video has helped shed light on some things but im still confused im a newbie and im open to ideas,1
i watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint keep going youve reminded me of what someone once said the mind is the man the poor is in it and the rich is it too this sentence is the secret of most successful investors i once attended similar and ever since then i have been waxing strong financially and i most tell you the truth the bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month they have managed to push the price by more than the majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical k level one thing is certain nobody knows what is going on our leadership in the country couldn t be any worse from the press to the feds they are all terrible they say you can t time the market but this one was easy to see coming every man woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance doesn t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check checks asap thats the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains its unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation things has been so difficult but btceth trading has helped me maintain financial stability although i believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why i made huge profits with the help of mr james wilson he is a genius and that is why i always advise beginnersinvestors to trade with professionals like him so far i have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from btc to atop btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by james and im an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy you all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ei m jameswilson cheers thank me later,2
great content i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over btc when i started at btc in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from feven lena i would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,2
wonderful video i first got into btc back in and have been hodlingbuying sats at different price points since ive been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play i dont have any alts as im a bit of a btc maxi but that said if btc hasnt died before it surely wont do so now stick in there yes we are all feeling the pain but over the long run this will just be a blip this is how i see past corrections when i felt that i got in at a high back then i think it was less than and bouncing all over the place now when i look back all i see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times but if you believe btc has value then by all means buy these dips if you can afford to for those who got in at or k and feeling the crunch hang in there btc is not a get rich quick scheme wait it out and you will see you will come away stronger i buy and just trade long term more than ever i made over btc with btc in just weeks from day trading with expert mr randy douglas crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish technical analysis is my second language you can reach mr randy douglas on ei m randytrade,1
im glad i got into cryptocurrencies back then because it was a turning point for me financially and was my best decision so far,2
lol so we ve gone full circle no longer proof of work no longer proof of stake but now proof of authority or trust which is essentially where we are already but now we are branding it with blockchain technology so it sounds exciting,2

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over btc from day tradng with wtrade inspects insights and charts they been one step ahead of other analysis,0
thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears as a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels as a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak however there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from mr ryan donald i have been able to accumulate over btc despite the current state of the market,0

always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis that small rally was a fake out we are entering a crab market i dont care about bearish market trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me implementing wtrade inspects daily trading signals and tips,2

i think the difference in this instance is that analyst s are stating that we are heading for a depression so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ath s great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective so many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom that short term thinking is such a rookie mistake by dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out next bull run it wont be a huge deal if we bought at k or k what will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low im really holding on for this possible low point reentry i screwed up some time back i need this lower point to get back in ive small cash on the sideline i dont like that but i refuse to fomo in our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before my advise to them is this go all out into trading trading is where the bucks are been made i see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up traditional markets are getting recked the new economy is crypto not fiat people want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment advisor mrs robin moore with her guides and trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having btc to atop btc in a short period of time invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader ei m moorerobin or whatsapp for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with her top notch trade signal,1
high inflation was never a reason to sellthe definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat essentially logically that would make sense even for stocks but especially for a commodity thats been known for many years as an inflation hedge my growing love for crypto caused me to explore until i came across alice marcella although im trying to avoid sensationalism alice is by far the best no hype for hypes sake but great inspiration to trade crypto the market has been irrational for far too long what were seeing today is a small correction of the illogical selling pressure,2
it makes sense btc and crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen the big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize the projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space i d get involved more knowing that i have made over btc from daytrade with axel william crypto in few weeks,1
keep up the great work the market price can best be described by logarithmic regression in my own opinion these kinds of ups and downs are nothing new meanwhile chad leon is doing a great job with his signals as ive been able to accumulate over btc with his help hes a pro in the crypto space and im no longer bothered about the market prices,2
great video and some nice tips this is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions this could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount wealth is created during bear markets not bull markets if your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over btc from day trading with karen gauvin in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,2

i have watched you for the past years and found you to be really down to earth and no frills congrates mate and stay real and love the fact you share your loses and wins good luck bitcoin price recently completed a twomonth surge that resulted in a price increase to over consequently investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrency s next target price billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price particularly in the last four weeks the loss has become the primary cause of several firms liquidation issues in the crypto industry i think the direction is upward movement with a bit of silence before the storm agree its boring for the past few days a good strategy for hoddlerss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn the rise will surprise everyone as for traders you make money anyways in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions if you re a modern investor then your main aim i guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility well goodnews you don t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with and trade with my investment advisor mrs robin moore trade signal and the rest will be a good history of profits for you as i have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop btc with btc with her trade signal despite the state of the market trading with her trade signal is a guarantee that profits are assured for helpguidance on buildinginvestingfinancial portfolio ei m moorerobin or whatsapp,2

i love how you spend some time drawingexplaining the elliot wave theory on a blank space then showing the chart very helpful ta i think changing colors of waves might help when you have tons of diff ones at same time instead of seeing all yellow i do love seeing all your waves on the chart though as it helps understand your thought process,2
bloody phenomenal content mate this is the best in depth analysis of the cryptobitcoin market i ve seen in recent memory i m increasingly astonished at and grateful for the quality of insight available,2
thanks so much for your help with understanding the charts i am enjoying your daily updates and ta and it is definitely helping me with my trade decisions trying to educate myself and your channel has become a must see for me every day,2

amazing nick best analysis on youtube keep up the good work,2
we are experiencing a period of breakdown where btc is going either really up or drops deep down any way i set the limits on the finex app to be able to buy it cheap,1
great content i like the way you explain everything thanks,2
always great info i honestly pick up a little bit more every time i watch great detailed info on the zigzag pattern that really clarified a few finer points for me,2
its a bit unclear about the prognosis on eth are you saying that we have to drop to levels and only then can it go up to level before finally coming all the way down to thats what it sounded like to me,1

i remember when binance was cents snd i didn t hold my bag,1
question was tom emmer an activer user of tornado cash why would he get involved in this issue read between the lines folks something is smelly here,0
happy early birthday uncle ran,2
your explanation is realistic and straight to the point on the other hand there are many ways of manipulating the market i was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market all that changed when i encountered gerard mcdonald strategy more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market,1
thank you wtrade inspects for keeping it light and real at the same time much needed for us hodlers in times like these,2
your help was unexpected it turned out to be timely such a divine intervention i cant thank you enough,2
hi austin thanks again for your input time can you shed any light on any pension contributions by certain companies either in the us andor uk rather than physical cash contributions this is a question and i know if you answer it is not financial advice,1
yeah ive been able to withdraw my initial investment and some profits from coswift arbitrage i still think this is still unreal though this wont last long term but at this point im making a daily if this doest go well ill be ok,2

what s the best choice investing in real estates or crypto because i have been thinking crypto seems to be one of the most promising at the moment,2
finland does not have gas storage because it is not dependent on nat gas for energy in fact currently finland does not import any gas from russia and it is not a problem the situation in germany on the other hand is completely different as there of households warm with russian gas,1
i live in the netherlands europe and got news for you we are already in an energy crisis gas price has gone x at the moment compared to prices pre covid that translates in x the price if you need a nrw energy contract so people here pay easy a month instead of euro but in prices are expected to euros a month that means an insane recession you think the bearmarket is almost over think againit only just started,0
in my younger years i guided flyfishing in alaska when looking out the window of the float plane sometimes i d see ponds that almost looked like they were boiling it was natural gas coming up through the permafrost the arctic regions of europe have these same stores of natural gas they need to utilized as a measure of self sufficiency energy independent and security the idea they haven t thought of this is crazy to rely on countries that harbor governments that brutalize their own citizens is not good business did you turn your back on the bully at school smiling and being nice is one thing but being in bed with evil is another,0
the whole world is intertwined in this energy crisis thanks lark,2
great summary of europes gas crisis lark id say its going to be a rough winter for some countries but reserves of gas have been made and there should also be a plan for alternative types of heating like heat pumps which are much more efficient,2
great video europe should also expect an extreme winter much like the extreme summer they have just experienced so the stores will definitely not be enough,0
when everyone thinks its going to be this bad it wont be this bad we have worried about this for months on end germany is ahead of where they want to be with gas supplies it is in everyones interest to talkrussiaeurope in coming monthswatch this space,1
spare change investible assets will be vastly curtailed stores of value will be tapped to pay for increased prices,0
one kind of perverse thing is that china has been using way less oil due to the real estateeconomic crisis so if we didnt have one crisis wed have potentially an even worse one w oil prices p yaaaay,0

thank you james for finally coming to the bright side and realizing that qt is actually a stimulus,2
i think the economic crisis has already affected crypto i just hope that the crypto market will be able to separate itself at least a little from the global crisis and begin to grow because i still want to see the result of the invested usdt,1

vechain gonna moon and a lot will miss it real life application at its finest,1
the reason the eu is so low has to do with the fact that countries in the eu such as italy spain portugal and cyprus since they still have large debts with the european bank can therefore not raise interest rates the countries can not repay their debt properly so that the debt becomes higher unfortunately these countries are still not doing anything in their country to ensure that their internal economies run better,0
other than the fact that it s all a giant house of cards except for btc i love crypto,2
let me guess this is the bottom ajajaja george has been saying the same thing the past weeks,1
great info as always george,2

despite suffering severe selloff in the face of uncertainties in the macro landscape btc ebbing tide seems to be subsiding with key metrics suggesting the cryptocurrency is poised to come ahead ark invest recently pointed out the weekly moving average a key indicator that is signaling btc could soon reclaim its lost glory i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over btc from trading with judith sherwood crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,2
despite the economic downturnim so happy i have been earning returns from my investment every days,2
i totally agree with what you are sayingthe fact is btc is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first for the past few days the price of btc has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose others are being patient it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals i would say trading has been going smoothly for me i started with btc and i have accumulated over btc in just three weeks with the trading strategy given to me by wtrade inspects,1
rumors were that amazon would launch amz this month and judging from this its pretty accurate haha,2
thank you for the update amztc is done right and waiting is part of the process,2
what i love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel you give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think you present each argument clearly and concisely i have made over btc from day trading with alice marcella signal in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,2
even with the current dip in crypto currency s i m so happy i can still smile back at my portfolio of built from my weekly trade i m having my th withdrawal in business days,2

i like your administration man i got my house with the assets of this wire i m glad l settled on the correct decision via the name above credit to you sir,2
i love the grounded reality of this channeli started in crypto in august and i bought ini was up x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about during the ensuing year bear market i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do i wish i had bought more i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from dickson jenkinshave learned from you and other youtubrs especially my mentor dickson jenkins who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from btc to btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and i know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past it is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research,2
perry omg i use to set a reminder that always ring with a note saying don t get too greedy lol coswift arbitrage has automated things for me now i don t have to worry about market movement,2
great platform for auto crypto arbitrage but i think the speed in which btc is deposited to the coswift account can be increase,2
i must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space first of all youre just awesome ive been following for months now and the cinematic videos excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding before anything else i would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go but we can try to make predictions using past events i think prices should run up a lot now punishing panic sellers and forced sellers most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a bull run perspective everything has changed we are in a recession facing stagflation rising rates and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof breaking consumers backs there are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market smart investors trade and take shortterm profits ive made over btc with btc retail trading not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market kyle miller i came across his channel where he shares his charts the selling fatigue will wane and the market will reset historically fortune favored the ones who bought in thought moments in moments of uncertainty when prices traded close to the wmayou can reach mr kyle on ei m kylemiller cheers thank me later,2
im supporting atozy all the way,2
he said did and is shady and he got called out i love when idiots think they can no be held to the same bs standards,0
i wouldnt be surprised if ben was the mastermind behind bitconnect p,1
this only means one thingpamp will go to the moon but for real it is good to see these guys get exposed by orhers in the community that means btc is losing ground and the truth eventually will come out,2
good vid i now understand what happening with this lawsuit bs,1
crypto makes being a thief a piece of cake no government oversight you pump up the numbers on your wallet the value goes up up people think they will make a profit so they invest their cash months later the price drops the cash has already been transferred to an offshore account so long suckers,0
the case had been dropped,1
hopefully bitboys next lawsuit isn t a civil one it s heavily bordering scamming and he s been the sole face of promotion could easily book him for aiding and co conscripting if they build up enough evidence,0
buffett has responsibility to protect share price for his shareholders t bills may simply be a hedge small portion of his cash position,1
like elon musk stated for tesla the only thing that matters is the speed of innovation the bitcoins and ethereums of today are picking up with new and innovative use cases the old ways will die out because they can not change and adapt quick enough with the changing times hodl oh yeah arcane bear is a beast would love to hear more insights from him,2
arcane could definitely host an after dark show,2
after the gfc we adopted mmt which basically means the only way to keep the economy going is to pump money into the m money supply fiscal stimulus lower rates etc with this change the boombust cycles have become more frequent and dramatic the emo chick is right things did change after and the economy changed and will change again as part of the rest inflation isnt our biggest problem with mmt but deflation will be the killer,1
ben is this show kind of rough watching this stuff day in and day out,0
so bitcoin is still worth buying if you have usdt,2
love arcane bears vibe keep having him on the show,2
hard to listen to someone that talks about we might have a recession coming when we are in a recession you lost me,0
this is helpful thankyou for this content you are awesome,2
success seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistake but they dont quit the stock market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payouts with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works,2
weve already been through market hell lol at this point nothing can surprise me or get me emotional eth can drop to and btc to or less and i wouldnt even care anymore honestly over it at this point dont have chips to buy the dip unfortunately but i sure as hell aint selling any till im sitting pretty,0
i always appreciate your levelheaded nohype approach to the markets and macro economic picture when newbies swarm to crypto in the next bull run and have to decide between all the clickbait bitcoin boys these are the kind of videos that should reassure them that you are the real deal thanks for your hard work and integrity here,2
the polygon token has lost its utility since it will no longer be used for gas fees can you tell us why youre still buliish on it,0
i love how none of these youtubers are talking about ftx getting a cease and desist letter for not having fdic insurance and leading customers to believe they did this is huge crypto news,2
ellio always with the cutting edge info keep it up,2
good video everyone needs more than their basic salary to be financially secured the best thing to do with your money is to invest money left in savings always end up used with no returns,2
my gameplan is to secure as much future proof altcoins awaiting the altseason and my own viable checklist for the pump is eth and wmt which i plan to amass more on in the wake of its fulhamfc partnership,1

your channel has truly changed my life ive been studying and researching about crypto for a while now and i got stuck at some point on the learning curve now i can say im truly improving my understanding of this whole new world and making great profit weekly all thanks to you,2

as the crypto market pauses with the stock market i take a deep look into the elliott wave theory count for the dow jones a requirement for bitcoin throughout all of its history has been that the stock market is rising int his video i attempt to do the elliot wave count for the stock market to see if it favors more upside along with discussing the psychology of each wave to see if that matches the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market right now below are products and services that i personally use and spend my own money on itrustcapital cryptocurrency retirement ira s are here and i can trade within my ira and have nontaxable events get credited to your account when you sign up and fund your account through my link a special deal worked out for viewers of the bcb channel and itrustcapital tradingview the technical analysis charting software i use in every video utilizing all the tips and tricks best practices complete analysis of the cryptocurrency market and exit plans get up to off your subscription when you sign up through this link linqto private equity investing in companies prior to having their ipo they offer popular companies like ripple unstoppable domains own a crypto domain and tie multiple crypto addresses and wallets to one simple human readable name like mine bcbackercrypto where you can send me xrp btc eth ada and more by using that one simple address ledger nano get your crypto off of the exchanges and into your own possession with a cold storage wallet hi i am the blockchain backer bringing you the latest cryptocurrency news and analysis the content of my channel primarily focuses on crypto news motivation and chart analysis on the xrp chart bitcoin chart various altcoin charts and market cap charts to support my channel and become a backer hodler or whale here on youtube here is the link disclaimer i am not a financial adviser investing and trading is risky and you can lose your money the information in this video should not be used to make any investment decisions you should contact a licensed financial adviser prior to making any investment decisions any affiliate links in the description of these videos may provide a commission if you decide to purchase their products i appreciate any and all support of my channel and without you i wouldnt be here thank you,1
the way you explained the psychology of each wave educated me so much thank you bcb have followed for years and you always bring value to the space,2
i love how you do focus on more than just crypto two quick questions if we do start wave any guess as to roughly what the peak would be is that the overall extension second what happens next if it hits that overall high i expect a crash but what if wave doesnt get that high,2
blockchain backer in the senario you describe are you expecting all time highs for alts or are you expecting to just take some money out when it goes up a bit more during wave,1
awesome video bcb thank you but what does wave in the stock market mean for the alt coin market would we have enough time for eth to finish that fractal you mentioned the beginning of the super cycle also the merge is coming in a few weeks is bitcoin going up to k considered a retracement that we need for the alt coin season we all want,2
what i love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel you give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think you present each argument clearly and concisely i particularly love the breakdown explanation of elliot wave theory and what actually happens psychologically with the market participants well done brother have a good one,2
absolutely love the discussions about the stock markets your crypto approach is tied to the performance of bitcoin which is usually tied to the stock market your stock market analysis helps to solidify your approach to crypto keep it up,2
amazing video just learning about the different waves really helps thanks for everything you do my dude helps plebs like me learn,2
an updated price prediction would be good or confirmation that your previous targets for the alts are still in tact i m presuming they are not but think it would be useful to understand what prices you are expecting if btc retraces thanks,2
thanks for what you do bcb ive learned so much from you man,2

apa cara terbaik untuk menghasilkan uang dari perdagangan kripto,1
mau tanya web atau tool mt atau broker exchange apa yg bisa untuk lihat chart analisa sprti mbak lengkap dgn indikatornya kl di exchange rata indikatornya ngk lengkap sprti mt,1
btc itu setau saya sudah kenyang dengan fud dan ketika ada fud dari nama besar karna mngkin dlu ga mempunyai btc di harga rendah yayaya bgtulah,1

i think why binance is killing it is that they are currently charging no fees for btc trading,0
bonuses are rewards for good work if a company went bankrupt that is not a good job,0
bonuses for failing companies is super common this doesnt make the practice of giving huge bonuses off the back of their creditors right its just weird that its in the news now because theyve been doing this for decades,0
i would think some of that is probably due to the fact that it is a per transaction fee and while institutional investors have larger transactions retail has a higher amount of them,1
the amount on exchanges seemed like it represented an absolute amount but given problems odyction of btc through mining increased this amount the real measure should be the percent of btc remaining on exchanges,1
i think the word bonus is maybe the wrong word that voyager is using i interpreted it to mean they want to offer a retention incentive to keep those they can t replace and they need to keep operations going smoothly in healthcare these types of bonuses are offered quite often to retain much needed staff in the long run the cost is well worth it,1
i ve been trying to go active on ftx us for the past four months each time i try to reach out to support i go through all the hoops to put in detailed information of what my problem is and i get the same canned response that does not address my issue it s a shame i plan on using them but if they can t get me set up i can t use them to successful i guess to really care about solving something as important as i m boarding a new customer,0
i think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a depression so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new aths great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective so many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom that shortterm thinking is such a rookie mistake by dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guesswork out next bull runs it wont be a huge deal if we bought at k or k what will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low im really holding on for this possible low point reentry i screwed up some time back i need this lower point to get back in i ve small cash on the sideline i dont like that but i refuse to fomo in our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before my advice to them is this go all out into trading trading is where the bucks are been made i see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up traditional markets are getting recked the new economy is crypto not fiat people want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment advisor mrkyle miller with his guides and the trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having btc to atop btc in a short period of time invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader ei m kylemiller for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with his topnotch trade signal,2
amazing research and presentation of information thanks lars,2
the daily btc trading volume is already way higher than the total cap release amount of btc by gox also not all coins will be release simultanious and there still is no hard date when it will happen plus not every creditor will sell it instantaneously and everything most obviously in short and in my humble opinion the price effect will be a drop in the ocean and nothing to worry about for btc holders especially in the long run when more and more people learn that leaving your coins out of exchanges eventually lead to continuation of upward price movement if sd stay equal and macro eff into acount,1
hey cto great video did you send emails out that theres a waitlist for the course now and its unavailable to get if not then the scammers are getting feisty,1

with you mate we my girlfriend and i are making moves to be able to solely focus our efforts during the bear market and have been liquidating our assets and in the coming weeks moving to a low risk low cost lower tax environment to be able to optimise all our efforts crypto and digital assets is the global revolution for man kind spiritually and culturally and our environment it sounds extreme and cultish but when on a precipice these extreme changes happen bitcoin is energy and economic jesus much love and thank you for the content,2
great stuff elio am totally with you ty for the daily input you give us my specialty are gaming launchpads cos it combines defi nfts and metaverse and if gaming is the future and we dont know which projects will win than quality gaming launchpads are the best bet anyone can take no influencer covers this topic in great detail i have developed advanced strategies which work like a swiss clock all thx to listening to you guys and taking what works and discarding what doesnt too many people take you guys too literally there are just sooo many advantages to gaming launchpads over layer s and other projects i made a fortune last year with seedify and other projects now making amazing passive income during the winter times am focused on finding new amazing launchpads such as spintop spores etc anything with great teams vision and tokenomics just loving this bear market to the max give me more,2
supply in housing is a metric to look at we are nationally below where we need to be you may be correct we are in a housing bubble but the supply is severely limited right now thank you for your content,1
there will be incredible amount of fud at the merge and a severe dip and opportunity if you move fast,1
no doubt the best bear market drinking game is taking a shot every time ellio says the reality is,2
that was a good one i agree,2
i like it when your videos have positivity and optimism everyone in crypto right now especially on twitter are ultra focused on the bear and further downward pressure like we get it we know it may come we may sink lower sideways whatever personally i also have conviction and totally click with what you are saying about gaming i know the market will return but for now i am not interested in talking about price more so what is being built so many exciting projects like defi kingdoms star atlas and many more all building through the bear even your own projects id be happy just to listen to videos on what is going on rather than what the prices are doing,2

great stuff i watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the market but havent made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and i do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands,2

hi casey can i ask something please thank you for your great videos i was thinking about stablecoins do traders convert btc into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and buy back by converting back into btc is this what people do also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes thank you for any advice all the best kieron,2
my is currently sitting at around im just sitting here waiting for july so i can not be greedy this time and cash out at least half of my money,1
probably what they know is that prices for all cryptos are incredibly low right now and its a great time to buy instead of being filled with angst and fear they are showing a little courage and going ahead and stacking up their bags at a time when it makes a lot of sense to do so i think people need to stop being so fearful now is the time to buy that should be pretty clear by now anyone whos shorting and selling and worrying about whether the bottom is in etc doesnt really know what theyre doing,1
i learnt a lot from this teamits been a while since i joined the discord and the patrons of cheeky cryptoi applied what you discuss in my day to day trading the gain was massivei am leverage trader and your insights always valuablethank you for your effort and daily videos,2

trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors its a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries for investors whats probably most attractive is the possibility of lifechanging returns dont worry youre not late to the crypto party were likely still in the very early innings leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market if youre new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert i have learned from alot of youtubers especially my mentor gerard mcdonald who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to btc lately,2
first got into btc back in and have been hodlingbuying assets at different price points since ive been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play i dont have any alts as im a bit of a btc maxi but that said if btc hasnt died before it surely wont do so now stick in there yes we are all feeling the pain but over the long run this will just be a blip this is how i see past corrections when i felt that i got in at a high back then i think it was less than and bouncing all over the place now when i look back all i see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times but if you believe btc has value then by all means buy the dips if you can afford to for those who got in at or k and feeling the crunch hang in there btc is not a get rich quick scheme wait it out and you will see you will come away stronger i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over btc with btc in just weeks from day trading with expert mr leon calvin crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish technical analysis is my second you can reach mr leon calvin on ei m leoncalvintrade cheers thank me later,1

i appreciate your help on recovering my bitcoin wallet and i hope to continue working with you for future bitcoin issues,2
thanks for the update i always appreciate the insight im really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long i had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video in as much i would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end if this is really a bear market rally then bitcoin is not done going down just like stocks are not done going down and if this isn t a bear market rally and the fed achieves a soft landing bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now but we just have to wait and see my hope is that by the fourth quarter the economy will be slowing enough that the fed says we are going to pause and then you will see the next crypto cycle start i have witnessed the last cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed imo please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategiessignals from eddie crypto a professional brokertradr that has been my mentor i have accumulated btc in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits people who are open to learning from history will survive it s not that difficult you can reach out to mr eddie on ei m his personal handle is edcrypto or whatsapp,2
i really appreciate your clear and simple breakdown on financial pitfalls i lost so much on cryptos but now making around k every week trading different on stocks and cryptocurrencies using wtrade inspects,2
ccrypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen the big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize and benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial few if any rug pulls the projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space i d get involved more knowing that i have made over btc from daytrade with wtrade inspects in few weeks,1

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over btc from day tradng with kerry pickett insights and chartshis been one step ahead of other analysis,0
i sincerely appreciate the knowledge you share if you have been closely watching the crypto or even invested in it chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over the truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the longterm despite the heavy outflows bitcoin still managed to promptly recover this recovery demonstrated bitcoin s strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery the obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy i have been trading with boston weber s signals and strategy for weeks which i have been able to accumulate btc with his signals he s a trader i believe everyone else can also work it,2
money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life life was really hell for me until i got into crypto investment since and am actually glad i started crypto when i did because it s been a turning point for me financially i cant ever regret making the greatest move that has changed my life financially today,2

thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage mad respect for educating everyone btcs price has been fluctuating lately but i think we should be educating the newbies on what to do aside holding rather than discussing about the dip the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage is understanding charts won t guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader ruby benally i made btc from the recent crash in the market within a period of five weeks,2

this channel got me into cubing and i ve realized how fun it actually is,2
i bought this cube few days ago and it is really hard i didnt solve it but i know people who solve it,1
the rubiks absolutely impossible,1
i remembered seeing rubik s impossible in walmart i thought it was just a scrambled cube but then i realized,1
your turning speed seems like you finishing the cube in seconds but imma just lyin,1
pov youre angry and throw it but it doesn t break,1
also everytime this legend is a god at cubing,1
i like how you had to say you were scrambling the cube cause you can t tell if you re solving or scrambling,1
when you send the rubik s impossible in a different angle that doesn t look solved,0

lets just appreciate the fact that jperm almost remembered all those names,2
jperm shows off his massive collection me looks at my cheap x i found at a toy store edit i just hit k likes yay i never thought this comment would still be getting replies and likes lol,2
first ive been questioning myself how does jperm know all those names second how is he this rich,0
i have the yj yulong v and in my personal opinion i think it s a pretty great cube to start out with,2
i would love to have this collection,2
the rubik s x does the exact same thing but it also has a lot of center twisting and lockups,1
nice collection my cube collection is something like this so i started out with a rubiks speed x when they were decent for beginners and not louder than an f car but it didnt last very long i corner cut too much and the entire thing exploded and some of the pieces went missing then for christmas i got a qiyi megaminx that i still havent learned how to solve then my friend gave me a tiled rubiks x this was the cube that i leaned to solve on then i got a moyu weilong wr im getting an scs corneredge magnet set and a cornercore magnet set you can get from the cubicle its a good cube and until christmas it will probably be my main and depending it my stay as my main longer than that,1
you make the type of video i can watch over and over again love the content i have watched this over times,2
i don t even cube i just watch these videos because they re satisfying and i find it interesting how enthusiasts of different things talk,2
i am surprised that the cube collection took less than minutes this was the best collection video ever created,2
hey there brightsiders have you ever managed to solve rubiks cube,1
this was so easily explained that i had to watch it a billion times,2
it was very hard at the beginning but after relentless struggle i finally finished watching the video,1
works perfectly giving us a bunch of things to do but not how to do them literally a masterclass,2
i watched it a trillion times in x speed but thank you because of you i solved my very st rubics cube and i belive that if i practice thoroughly ill be able to solve without any issues thank you bright side,2
finally i finished it and made it in one piece the final stage was the hardest i couldnt remember any move so i had to keep pausing the video and rely on the white color to not get lost since its the only color thats the same with your rubiks cube on the process,1
how to solve a rubik s cube in no time leave it how it was bought,1
finally after years i was able to solve the rubiks cube without cheating peeling off the stickers thanks a lot for this guide,2
very well explained it took hrs straight to keep solving it with all the algorithm in the video those trying to solve from this video keep practising the algorithm step by step and solve it,2
this was really helpful thank you,2
people say this every year but its astounding how z scrambles all his cubes just for a five second clip at the beginning,2

most people dream of having half your collection i love the vids so much im getting a x today,2
do you see it the big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers the cloverleaves are actually the edges and for the corners half of them look like centers and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle this means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there and that just makes it really hard,0
your collection has been growing so much year after year it s amazing,2
this is a great review of what i missed when i stopped cubing for the past years i m back at it now thank you for the video,2
i love octopuses no but seriously i remember him back in like when the end of the year would always mean getting my subscription feed flooded with cube collection videos nowadays it seems like you re the only one who still does it i enjoyed every minute of this long video and i also salute how much effort it would ve taken to solve all those puzzles,2
you should try the mgc square its what all the top solvers use these days the mgc x is also really good,2
octopi can fit through any area that is equivalent to the size of their beak also if anyone didn t know mollusk have beaks also octopi are mollusks thank you for this amazing video well done good sir definitely gave me some ideas as far as new puzzles and potential mods i appreciate the time you put into filming and production as well no matter what anyone says that just remember you re doing it if you feel unhappy with even the slightest things in a video always remind yourself that you are doing something when other people aren t i ve been watching your stuff for years and have always enjoyed these cube collection videos thank you again for your content,2
this is gonna be a fun movie,2
how long did it take you to guess what the image was,1
im surprised it only took hours to solve the cubes this project is insane well done good sir,2
your persistence and creativity know no bounds mike this is amazing and how amazing is daily puzzles,2
i appreciate your honesty about the power of being an influencer,2
really cool that you didnt immediately spoil what the image was gonna be such a cool picture,2
this is mike saying im back in the most mike way possible,2
this is insane respect,0
its super interesting how parts of the image look gray from a distance despite there being no actual gray on the cubes,2
mike somehow manages to surprise us and top himself with every new video keep up the great work,2
as a cuber this video is so good usually cubing videos made my people who know less about the hobby get things very wrong and mislead people but not you also dailypuzzles is a great store good to see you giving them exposure,2
first cube unboxing second cube unboxing third mystery fourth and now im impressed,2
thanks cube head for your amazing content love your cubing content definitely on the top cubing content creators for me,2
cubehead is not just a person or a channel its an emotion,1
dude i just want to say your videos are so good and are just getting better and better,2
let me find minutes of my life to watch this masterpiece later today,2
dude this is why youre one of the best cuber youtubers id say even my favorite made my day,2
when a new video comes out i literally put everything down just so i can watch it you re the best cubehead,2
the idea for the cube lube vid sounds like a banger i really love setting up my cubes and i think that the yoo cube setup is probably the best one out there especially because it works on almost every cube,2
thanks for making excellent content keep up the great work and congratulations on k subscribers,2
hey cube head quick question have you got a package from the cubicle that you havent unboxed on your channel also love your videos,2
like this comment if you think i have a career in opera please dont edit everyone complaining about the and see the video description,0
i own a x super hard to solve it keeps slipping through the atoms of my hand,0
the transition from x to x was great,2
someone you cant scramble a x me,1
i love how the x is so smooth,2
it s interesting how they get rounder the more blocks you add,2
can we just appreciate that he scrambled the pieces to make this video,1
legends still thinking how to move,1
i love how after x the surfaces stop being flat,2
when you level up in a game and theres so many dang rewards,2
cubers watching this video be like,1
if he can solve it one handed that s impressive the whole wca event am i a joke to you,1
cubers be like wtf how is hand inpressive he can t even do it in seconds,0
i thought he was cuber but this video first part is satisfying,2
awesome video i could never solve those at all how do ppl do that great job,2
watching someone who knows nothing about speed cubing is mildly entertaining,1
on the thumbnail a x rubik s cube would just completely fall apart if you turn it without increasing the size of the outer layers,0
being a speedcuber watching him say how do you even do that one handed hurts me inside edit everything about this video hurts me inside,0
the answer is no the fastest unofficial time is around seconds the fastest official time is which is held by yusheng du,1
its called unscramble it is just scrambling the cube then doing the pattern reverse,1
am i the only who realized that quintillion is less than sextillion,1
lets appreciate how much effort and humor are in his videos hope m soon,2
pretty cool video you explained with humour how is a so huge number possible well done,2
this video is sick thank you for making it i m really curious about why we divide by to account for the cube states that aren t possible like a single misoriented corner or edge can anyone explain why thank you,2
im suddenly questioning myself how we can solve it in one five patterns,1
nice loop,2
i love ur editing and also wow when you just look at a cube you don t think that there s quintillion combinations cool,2
yea but cant the centers also be oriented in different ways like with picture cubes its possible to have the whole cube solve except one center piece thats rotated,1
no way vids in one day this is the best day ever,2
as usualy great content and great editing,2
great win few more hit well played roshtein cheers,2
what an amazing hit,2
y all really watch and believe this guy he gets personal best on every slot his never out of money his always up m his max wins come back to back or within a week he will get if y all think that s true go try it good luck not to mention the amount of times and buys i ve seen ppl ripp this machine he just casually got near max spins times in a row easy man this stuff is wild and to all who s watching don t waste your time i ve dabbled in this community they all got higher rtps big sponsors and boosts to win and bonus more don t be fooled,2
brother god bless you,2

best gambler gz for the money,1
omg wow,2
ahhh the life of a scammer,0
not mil,1
mi canal en espa ol friends channel about customization the best channel about crafts guys it was an incredible challenge my team and i spent an incredible amount of time to shoot this awesome issue watch it and tell us have you seen such records before,2
respect to this lad just solved my first x cube and it took me hours i cant imagine how difficult that must be amazing you earned a sub mate,2
one of the thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he archives something he always respect us the audience and his team and he is polite in all his video we congratulate ourselves on this achievementmore to come we re always with you,2
congratulations man this was really an insane effort you goal was almost impossible and you did it i really cant imagine solving big cubes for h omg,2
i really congratulate you my hand hurt even just watching it i dont know how you endure this pain but i can say that you are a really patient and determined person although i love this video you shouldnt push yourself so hard to show us these you can produce simpler content anyway i wish you continued success,2
i m curious if solving them biggest to smallest would change it at all by the time your eyes are tired the hardest of them would be done might be worth a comparison some time,1
mindblowing brother incredible love from india huge respect for you,2
i really likes your method for the x tutorial i can now solve it like seconds even though im kind of a beginner,2
you are a legend you deserve great respect for this,2
you are really a hard worker i loved that you were doing im also a cube lover but im a beginner i really appreciate what you did,2
amazing work ryden you ll be under a minute in no time how good are rubik s cubes right,2
go ryden great work we love this thanks for sharing,2
wowgood job,2
it makes me feel so proud because i was about his age when i learned how to solve my first rubiks cube,2
im a speed cuber myself the mindset to improve at speedcubing is the same one skateboarders have you gotta keep pushing your limits i bet you that in two months hell be doing less than seconds consistently get him the speed stacking timer and also some kind of mat to protect whatever hes gonna drop his cube at,1
hey ryder as a cuber with a sub average just i recommend smooth and consistent movements to speed up however you re doing amazing you will get minute in no minute and you are so fast for not much practice keep working buddy,2
i am beyond proud of ryden i m a speedcuber this is so amazing to see,2
i love how ryden sticks his tongue out while he is trying to solve the cube lol,2
my goodness it took me literally months to get past the second layer and get to the speed im at todaycongrats ryden,2
great work i actually need help solving my rubik s cube,2
i want to ask you to watch to the end but i also dont also thanks for everyone who said youre on team tingboy ill let him know,2
i always love tingman s video not just due to its high quality but also that it s very wholesome,2
olor s face when tingman bring out his secret cube got me dying,1
i genuinely like the mini gan x over the x just because i m a gan fan and because i can only solve the x,2
i am kind of a non cuber but your videos are still very good keep up the great work,2
the x is definitely a bigger milestone than the x,2
this is so hilarious imagine if olor throws the x to the gan,2
tingman don t be fooled by the size also tingman i won because of the small cube,1
for the last cube i expected olor to bring out the gan and,1
hi ting man thank you so much for your private message arlo absolutely loves it we would like to know how many cubes you have thanks stu arlo,2
i thought i did pretty well and then timmy solved all sides blindfolded lol,2
connections are powerful i mean how does souptimmy a cubing youtuber become friends with someone who has x his subscriber count,2
timmy if he can solve the white side in seconds also timmy solve this puzzle in seconds,1
another fun video,2
to be friends with soup timmy you have to be good at solving rubix cubes,1
i never knew zhc could solve a cube lol,1
you re friends with zhc interesting,1
yoooo the collab with zhc was very unexpected nice,2
i love zhc and soup timmy s videos,2
yay zack so unexpected edit thanks for so many likes,2
on top of the giveaway to people who use discount code cubehead this month the cubicle is giving away more puzzles to people on instagram,2
this was super fun to watch you are definitely improving with each video ill have to get some of these cube mods for sure,2
i personally would switch the places of the metal and the smallest i lose things easily especially that tiny cube,0
the quality of content this man brings us to entertain us is just huuuuuuge,1
hey cubehead thanks for the wonderful videos i can t wait for this one keep the content up you never fail to impress me,2
awesome video as always kind of disappointed that my personal favorite the ghost cube didnt make the list,2
guys i made the list also loved the green screen effects cubehead always stepping up his game,2
lets just all take a moment to appreciate how much work and effort he puts into his videos we love u cubehead,2
you always motivate me to cube faster and your videos are so entertaining keep up the good work,2
this was very entertaining you are like the ryan trahan of cubing,2
thank you all for helping us reach k subs as for the k giveaway ironic i know x cards are for kauan mariani ferreira abhinav basnet congrats to you i ll reply on your comments for info ivaan srivas still needs to contact me for the giftcard i ll give it one more week otherwise i m giving that one away to someone else,2
well send a chinese dictionary in the next package,1
you cant use the timer on a black surface as black doesnt reflect infrared light try using it on a white table,0
the m is a great cube the newer versions which are one of the air leap or pro and the air has not as many features as the pro and leap and the leap just has bigger core magnets than the pro which can sometimes be a disadvantage i main the m pro with the default ges and set it up with drops of dnm which stops most of the catches and lockups,2
something you could use the gan is for is switch the cores and pieces around with different cubes like the wrm or the x,1
awesome unboxingas always of the cubes that i can t buy lol,2
milan i wanna catch up to the latest cubes on the market and expand my cube collection phil alright how much do you want them for milan yes memes aside its been forever since ive experienced unboxings and this one just takes the cake all of these at one is just,2
hey why dont you try some other events like big cubes squan clock skewb or pyra we really want to see you solving some other events and we also want the next episode of rtwr series btw love your content,2
congratulations on passing k subs i really love the valk elite m,2
this guy deserves so many more subscribers,2
join the k giveaway,1
finally a cube i can solve,2
i can literally speed cube with that now without any worrys,2
sees white me you liar,0
him calls a gan cube a regular cube me wait thats illegal,0
therapist the white thing in blue rubiks cube was never exist they cant hurt you the white thing,1
ese cubo azul se mira que se ah de aentir muy satisfactorio girarlo,2
someone by is hardest blue boi are you sure about that,1
hey scramble this for me really quick,1
a cube i can mix up without worrying,1
i cant be the only one who always preffered stickers until i actually tried stickerless lmao,1
i personally love the look of stickerless they just look so much cleaner imo,2
i really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect i have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes its very frustraiting,0
it would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces this is the reason why i prefer stickered cubes the alternance between colors and black kind of like shadows make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool d aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself which with a stickerless cube is just not possible it just seems like one big cube do you know what i mean edit i guess what i wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which i don t really like,2
what i find good about stickerless is that you can be almost sure that if youre buying a stickerless cube it will turn at least halfdecent while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations like the original rubiks series of course you always look closely at what youre buying but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about,2
thats the first time i see someone talking about colorblind speedcubers as a colorblind guy i always had a stickered cube thank you for talking about this a little bit love your vids,2
i competed back when stickerless was illegal so i was thrilled when it was legalized just to find i enjoy stickered more i like when the stickers get worn it shows mileage on a cube which i think is cool,2
for me whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot i have always used a stickerless cube and when i got a stickered cube i noticed that i was a lot worse at look ahead i made more mistakes in f l and took longer to look,0
i have always used stickerless cubes from when i learned all through now one day a friend and i swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes i like my cubes fast he likes them slower his main was a stickered cube not only was i turning bad because the cube was slower then i was use to but the stickers felt so weird i just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker,0
i prefer stickered on x because i love the look any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get damaged and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying i would probably feel differently if the stickers from speedcubeshop werent as good as they are so i would still take a stickered x over a stickerless given the option,0
you can get the cube here,2
buy one get one free person but it s only cube the cube,1
dayum what a game breaking dupe i hope the developers patch this soon,0
i needed to watch this several times before watching closely how to separate the two cubes to actually understand how its possible to have twice the same cube as the first one xd,1
this takes by one get one free to a whole new level,2
teacher nothing is infinite the cube you dare defy me mortal,0
matter cannot be created or destroyed cube reality can be whatever i want,1
i got one of these a couple years back its also called a star cube,1
i have the same exact thing the trick is when its only one cube the second cube is hiding inside of it then when its two cubes theyre both hollow also the star is called a dodecahedron,1
due to this glitch we have disabled cubes,0
s o o b s k r i e b,1
i love how hes just enjoying the patterns that are supposed to be really frustrating,2
i feel like every time he mixes up a hard puzzle and doesn t solve it i come a bit closer to dying,0
ive just recently gotten back into puzzles so naturally im enjoying watching videos like this i saw the thumbnail for this one and im like my gods where are yall getting all these from so i click and literally in the first seconds you give me the answer and a sweet discount code thank you the x axis looks horrible the x axis im working on is a nightmare,2
wow those puppet cubes look crazy reminds me of the secret move on the x x,2
this was such an awesome premiere it was great to hang out with everyone in the chat and i loved the video overall thank you,2
i have the spherical one my friend aradhay pronounced aradyu has a pyraminx the rediminx seems easy but its actually hard the moyu puppet cubes are so weird,0
the pie cube looks like a round x x so if you know how to solve a x x you can probably solve the pie cube hope this helps,2
it was hard enough for me to solve the normal axis cube i can t imagine doing the x,0
i ve had the rainbow ball for about years now it s very easy and basically pointless but it s good for young children and collectors,2
thankyou guys,2
congratulaions you just solved an already solved cube,2
basic cubing rule doing any set of moves will eventually put the cube to the solved state like if you do a set of moves like r u r u on a scrambled cube it will still be unsolved,1
doing that algorithm on an unsolved cube times will just put it in the same unsolved state,1
if you keep repeating the exact same steps on an unsolved cube it will come back to what it was before but since you used an already solved cube it came back to itself because you repeated the steps until it went again but if you do it on an unsolved cube itll just go back to how unsolved it was at the start,1
i forget the trick and now i am solving for years,1
this is exactly what i was searching for thanks dude,2
you have teached me to solve the rubix cube thanks,2
i was solving it whole night with your trick and finally it didnt solve,0
bro as a rubik s cube solver that s just the right algorithm,2
friends channel about customization mi canal en espa ol the best channel about crafts,2
really simple explanation went through the first part in a breeze thanks looking forward to learning the subsequent parts,2
i cant believe this solving this cube for the first time in my life it took days to solve it through this tutorials now i can arrange it and i know every moves correctlythanks much cubastic i couldnt believe that one day ill solve it all alone live long,2
now at last i solved it for the first time in my life easy and perfect tutorial,2
ive looked at so so many videos trying to to do this correctly and this is the first video that helped so so much thank you,2
i really love the way he explains the way the cube works and how you can make the turnsconvinient i feel like i could learn a lot from this if i havent already learned how to solve it,2
i finally received my first cube today and i m finally getting it i m so excited thank you cubastic you re a great teacher,2
thank you so much bro it was very easy and you explained everything in detail god bless you,2
thanks i really helped me i solved my cube instantly after watching the video even solved it underwater,2
thankyou so muchyour explanation was very easy to understand and attempt i am glad i came to your video it helped me alot now i am gonna follow your part,2
fun fact jelly is made by gelatin which is made by pig bones so tingboy was correct,2
she s gonna love the jelly cubes i own them all and think they re the coolest looking ones in the collection,2
olor is so positive even about punishments that s great,2
i wonder how olor s beanie still fits she s had it for so long,1
tingman really just destroyed the internals of of cubes for this one video thats dedication,0
olor is absolutely adorable such a magnetic personality tingboy isnt far behind i see great channel kids love it,2
the pure joy on olor s face when she gets to put her face in the jelly is amazing,2
definitely one of the most creative ideas nice job as always tingman,2
this was such an awesome video good job mate you all bring my family great joy xd,2
ting man why is she so fast also tingman take three five second brakes to say look at all this jelly,1
rubiks cube logic you repeat same moves it will return to the same position eventually after a multiple of moves,1
jisko fake lagta hai woh like karo,1
i spend years perfecting this skill and now i realise it was this simple for those who are wondering this trick only works in a solved cube,2
maths always rocks nothing can beat mathcalculation nor magic or,2
its not a trick it is their hard work they practice to years to get the perfection to solve blind folded or in seconds,1
my bro didnt considered that years of practice for solving rubiks cube in seconds,1
rip for those who thinking we can solve this in second,1
i tried it with an already jumbled cube no it didnt workeven it got messed up even more lol and i did absolutely as instructed,0
bro i can solve in sec if ur reapeting same moves applicable on solve state for solving scrambled cube learn bigenner method roux method zz method cfop method any of these,1
i am a speedcuber i have learned more than algorithms of rubikis cube this method can be done only when it is scrambled in its relative manner otherwise this method failed,1
you have figured out a way to combine howtobasic sorta beluga and cubing and i respect that you have earned a sub edit wow i have never gotten this many likes on a comment thank you all,2
can we all appreciate how good of a cubist he is,2
this guy never fails to entertain us,2
this is what beluga would become if he was a speed cuber,1
can we just appreciate how his dad spent k on a cube just bc his son managed to solve a cube in under secs,1
i really dont know how people can solve it and read the cube so fast with just colors,0
dad i solved my cube in seconds dad how long did it take,2
alternate title never let a non cuber touch your expensive cubes ever again,0
i like how this man can solve this damn cube in seconds when it s been years since my last cube i still can t even solve it,0
i love how this channel is like beluga but a cube version editthanks for likes guys can we get to likes,2
not quite sure how i stumbled across this channel but hey its pretty cool lol my skill with a cube involves trying to peel the stickers off one about years ago and giving up lol,2
i was fully waiting for the cube at the start to pop,1
im just impressed how fast you can solve an s cube,2
yeah yeah the time and the cubes are very different but the one thing everyone neglects is the price,0
great vid keep up the great work,2
plastic gang how many magnets do you want yes edit mom im famous,1
u honestly turned quite fast on the cube lol,2
fun fact when erno rubik first invented the rubiks cube no one even he thought it was possible,1
pov he solved a cube from faster then you solve the best cube in world,2
kinda crazy how something started as a puzzle toy thing that you can buy and now has a lot of different difficulty s and has competition s,1
comment if you cant even solve a regular rubiks cube,1
thanks guinness i actually made it in though had to wait for it to be ratified it would have made a great story to say i did it in lock down but the truth is i didnt,2
imagine looking into your neighbours backyard and seeing a meterhigh rubik s cube,1
buen d a felicidades por esa obra monumental qued fant stico,2
i guess this is the best guinness record of all time mainly because of his hardwork and dedication to make this,2
well as an obsessed cuber this has satisfied me,2
just imagine bringing that to a speed cube tournament,1
i thought it was going to be funny but ended up being just epiclove this man,2
the dedication that he had to not use one of those poles as a lightsaber and start breaking stuff is insane,0
now how long would it take to solve that big one in world record time,1
i cant even do a x and this man is doing x i don t even have a clue what to do whenever i m solving he just knows all the ways,1
the fact that people can even do x cubes is beyond me but watching this guy did a x and in only and a half hours blew my mind on another level,0
o seu v deo foi o motivador necess rio para q eu nunca tente montar um desses kkkkk valeu amigao,1
i cant even make the x cube imagine x this man is very wise congratulations im from brazil,2
for him and half hours for me centuries,1
congratulations your effort and teaching methods are memorable good god bless you,2
this guy is insane i can t even solve a x in hours,0
i love solving cubes i ve gotten real good at my x in sec and i just got my megaminx but someday once i m better at it i wanna get my hands on one of these,2
je t d v ne jsem se nau il skl dat rubikovu kostku x x jsem se j jako mal kluk nau il kompletn rozebrat a spr vn slo it bylo to rychlej a jednodu ne ji ot en m ve spr vn m po ad slo it tak jak se m ale p ed v mi kloubouk dol,1
what do you think it will be like in,1
imagine going back to the s with a rubix cube from now and say you wanna see some real speed,1
this really made me realize the improvement in the journey of cubing i wouldnt be surprised if years later i look back at my current speedcube and recall how the days were,2
the lighting effects look really cool,2
i still have the one and its still a great cube i really like feeling of it want to buy more modern cube soon tho,2
simplemente hermoso,1
still in love with the zhanchi still using one amazing cube,2
i was at a trampoline park and after i was done jumping i decided to play some arcade games i won tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there it was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction so i decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere midday with spectators around safe to say i could never get it back together i ended up buying several speed cubes and i m able to solve all of them,0
i love how the years go by the music gets louder,2
imagine the future,2
this is cubes proceeds to make every shape in the universe but a cube,1
its actually cubes proceeds to fold it into a new earth,1
its actually cubes proceeds to make a whole new dimension,1
he puts the cube in the strange shape me being annoyed that he put orange to red,0
this is cubes proceeds to make d shape in the multiverse from one single fucking d cube,0
it s actually three cubes proceeds to fold it into a spaceship,1
it s actually three cubes proceeds to make a portal to a whole different dimension,1
so how does you cube turn him yes,1
when he pit the cube inside the triangle it just completely camouflaged,1
i like how he tried to do the levitation effect at the beginning up down up down,2
troubleshooting video,1
we love this thanks for sharing,2
i m years old and was challenged by my son to solve the cube he tried to show me for weeks but i couldn t do it tried other demos and nothing i watched your video and it all clicked solved it in two days now i can do it without watching thank you for being a great instructor i m working on a faster time now i can do it in about minutes,2
i ve tried so many tutorials and this video was the only one that was able to teach me how to solve it you explain everything so thoroughly and in a way that s easy to understand you should make a tutorial for the x,2
this tutorial is amazing i was a bit confused at the end when finishing off but i eventually solved it hours later i cant believe it only took days for me to solve thats really amazing for a beginner i really expected it to take weeks but it was only days,2
thank you so much for this video all of the other tutorials were a bit harder to follow but your video was followable and all of the steps were easy and organised once again thank you so much,2
you are a fabulous teacher no ego showing off or any of the things that discourage new cubers so clear and user friendly i am an older person who has cubed for years i solve many cubes cuboids odd shaped magic cubes and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here so while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that cant be solved with advanced algs a pleasure i will show this video to a young neighbor whom i just gave a x and she is very excited about it i feel shed do well with your great teaching style,2
i have been trying to solve a rubik s cube for a year and your video has made me very confident around rubik s cubes thank you for making this video,2
i solved my first rubik s cube after watching this video thank you for simplifying the process and being a great teacher,2
fantastic tutorial much better than the others i watched its not lengthy and simply explained time frames are much appreciated the only thing i did not enjoy in the tutorial is the last layer part bc the algorithm was not taught in the intro and i messed it up due to the lack of practice on a side note i liked when you voiced the algorithm sequence not just showed,2
nice talent keep up the good work shabash,2
congratulations for k,2
my real name is actually kartik im proud of my clone,2
i also know that,1
nice quality,2
i know this trick,1
congratulations bro k subcribers,2
already solve the pramix but you are twist the corner,1
i know how to solve it that s why,1
allwow how he solved that me thinking why he is saying cube to a pyrimid shape,1
how to solve this,1
bhai yah mere ko bhi solve karna aata hai,1
bahot hard,1
i also know how to solve this pyramid,1
hard hai,1
i know how to solve every cube,1
wait the cube was a green screen always has been,1
what do you do for a living i rickroll my viewers with cubes i broke down,1
smart rickroll and so smooth edit,2
epic so did you take apart each piece and combine the same colored pieces and then put together the cube,1
meanwhile how many seconds you can solve a green rubiks cube seconds,1
wow that was smooth u deserve a sub my guy,2
i just realized that is impossible because the pieces have different colors on them except for the middle piece,0
me proceeds to turn one side of a completely red cube brain turn it back me what s the worse that will happen cube turns into a scrambled x brain told you so,0
me turns one side of green cube oh i guess nothing will happen my brain turn it backkk,1
finally a rubik cube i can easily solve,2
lol in school i literally thought i created a pattern,1
i love when music is synced with the rotation of the cube,2
musiccube rotation is god level,2
thanks bro i already learnt tricks of rubix cube and this is my i have seen your video times to learn this after this i got a pain due to twisting of my hand thanks again,2
me trying in window just like him st time my balance goes cube rip,0
who doesnt know repeat any moves serveral times on a solved cube and you will solve it again,1
thanks bro i learned from u,2
legends know this trick when rubiks cube was invented,1
its called jellyfish and it can be only used on a solved cube and used to make a checkerboards pattern,1
ya lo conozco pero igual est muy bien para novatos,1
imagine a random cube in the subway being that easy to turn,1
fun fact when she solved the yellow side she didnt actually just solve the whole yellow side randomly she actually got the whole first layer done,2
and this was the backstory of two of the best cubers in the world,2
as a cuber i loved how they entered the color areintation correctly and used actual oll algorithms in the animation,2
ive watched that when i was a non cuber kid it literally gives nostalgic feel,2
shes speedcubing in another level by learning cfop so fast,2
i gotta say hats off to all the animators and editors that made this masterpiece,2
thanks so much for this video it was oddly satisfying to watch and i love the animation and animation style this must have taken a long time to make kudos,2
i like how she feels rather upset about it being just an inanimate toy again but still feels proud of herself from being able to solve it that last glance out the window tho the little details,1
become a part of the spinlife community over on our discord server for exclusive giveaways,2
the guy got x on and didnt even bat an eye lid when it happened and yet people think this is real cmon,0
god i have never seen such an insane start awesome win,2
omg that was so close to max,0
cubes but a really nice win phillebro,2
when you play it looks so easy when i play it looks like shit,0
lumayan diksih jp juta tadi main modal ribu servernya lagi gacor bos caranya ada di ytb ku ini yaa,1
even though you should be enjoying the game didn t let you by leaving cubes behind,0
fisrt,1
normal people today ill be showing you how to use a cube stand timmy this is how you can not use a cube stand,0
lets see how fast it will spin cube turns into atoms,1
lets see how fast we can spin this breaks cube,1
so lets see how fast we can spin this lego breaking sound effect,1
timmy so lets see how fast we can spin this breaks cutely,2
lets see how fast it can spin him hulk smashhhh,1
timmy lets see how fast we can spin it the cube ah shiiiii,1
a wise man once said now thats a lot of damage,0
i actually really like that stand the triangle stands never let me show the logo on the cube and stand at the same time,2
so much effort in these videos continue like this mate,2
i know how its done first they got something like paper on the cube to make it look like its scrambled but the original one is already solved,1
kkkkkkkkkkk,1
thanky bro,2
if you watch it clearly you can see that there s two boxes,1
magic,1
if you apply same formula on a cube multiple times itll comes in same position after some times when you started,1
thanks im gonna inpress my friends now,2
thank you this is working,2
congratulations u just solves a already soved cube priceless,2
it is very nice i learned it,2
congratulations you have just solved the solved cube,2
thats not a way to solve it thats a repeated pattern anyone with a cube has did some patterns like doing the same exact move over and over and over until the cube gets back to the original point,1
wow you are genius,2
the fact that it s already solved,1
its either up or downhahaha btw nice video,2
it wouldn t be that difficult to fix the rubik s brand smaller core smoother edges and the corners in the pieces could be rounded for more corner cutting,1
j perm once brought up that rubiks brand doesnt really corner twist or pop for nonspeedcubers who wouldnt know how to fix those issues in a way that keeps the cube solvable its more important cube design makes these things impossible than it is important for cubes to be fast,1
i recently got myself the impossible cube that you showed at the end there regular rubiks brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box i believe they either dont give a shit because theyre still the largest or theyre incompetent,0
i think its also built the way it is to prevent the cube from popping and corner twists you have to keep in mind its the og cube meant for people that dont understand the puzzle and if anything like that were to happen then the puzzle is therefore broken to them,1
i have a rubiks cube thats almost years old i got into cubing recently and bought a meilong as soon as i got some disposable pennies i always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age but seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now i wish i could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference,0
my friends are going to a speed cubing comp next week so they wanted to get me into it too currently have a broken thumb and a rubiks brand cube my best time is i learned how to solve it days ago and i m currently dreaming of how fast i can get my time up to if i had a working cube and thumb,2
i have only had a rubiks cube for the entirety of my speed cubing journey im finally going to get a good speed cube but my best time on a regular cube is seconds it can be improved im sure,2
the og rubiks cube was set up to be basically temperamental child proof like you demonstrated you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle but its also super unlikely to pop or cornertwist during normal use noncubers often consider a cube broken if its popped or cornertwisted i remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin cornertwisted it that comes at the expense of having almost no cornercutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn but then again its not meant to be their speedcube the rubiks brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though but for different reasons,0
i have had a rubixs cube for about years now and in all that time it has never popped i am not much of a speedcuber but i average at around seconds on that cube and i know about algorithms it has got a couple of scratches but it still works like a charm now i am going more into speedcubing and i am considering buying a magnetic speedcube,2
love how you make videos for noncubers too i hope it will make more people into speedcubing,2
i forgot to say i wait about a minute or two and then my coffee gets,2
me can i get some ice with that jeanelle sorry our ice machine broke,0
too lazy to make ice cubes bro you pour water in a tray and leave it in a freezer that s apl,0
me after trying metal icewhy does my water test like metal,0
my mother used to use plastic ice cubes back in the s i impressed all my friends they were colorful and cool i also was the first vegan on my block my friends would beg for our vegan food which was really just regular food with no cheese or meat haha yeah i miss those days haven t tried the metal ones nice,2
keep in mind that real ice cubes can absorb times more heat than steel ones so it isn t consuming as much heat and might burn you if your drink was above celsius about i didn t do the math water can absorb times what steel can even,1
just a tiny minus you cant chew on the ice,0
the one fear i have with these things is accidentally swallowing them its easy to forget theyre not really ice cubes id use a straw with these of the time,0
i remember going to a friends house and seeing these but the plastic version and i thought they were real so i was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my friend just stared in shock,0
i used to freeze a metal spoon and use it to stir my hot drinks when i was a kid i totally recommend it if you just want to chill it and be done,2
how to solve the rubiks cube faster please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the moves has the moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step at i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step if you can only get or edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step there should be no problems here step if you ever get only corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step finish the moves dont stop at every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,0
learn the rubix cube in min hours of going back seconds later edit i d just like to announce that i have done the impossible and solved the cube if someone such as myself can then i m more than hopeful whoever reads this is capable of doing the same,2
this actually worked really well for me the first time i tried it it took me awhile but i got to the last step then messed it up but i realized it was still partially solved somehow except the yellow was the one that was solved and the white was broken up i just redid the last few steps with the cube upsidedown yellow on the bottom and white on the top and it worked thanks for this wonderful tutorial this was my first time solving a rubiks cube,2
this is clearly an old video but lemme say ive been watching this video everyday for the last week or two and i can finally solve the cube without watching its been a long waiting bucket list thing to solve this without help and i got it thanks j perm loved the video and your content,2
i love this tutorial its pretty easy to follow thank you,2
thanks man even tho i never would have got this on my own it was still super satisfying to solve one for the first time,2
nothing hurts more than being on the last step and then messing up the algorithm,0
took me couple hours but i did it thanks to this guide appreciate it,2
thanks you so much for this video solved my first cube today with your help,2
thank you i am now part of the small percentage of people to completely solve a rubiks cube couldnt have done it without this video,2
this song hit different when you actually having a good day,2
the idea of a song about having a plain old good day from a genre that usually produces music about death and the lowest points of life it s really something to cherish,2
this song is so reassuring in a strange way its so comfortable to listen like a goodol friend youre happy is around,2
saudade da inf ncia que nostalgia,1
nostalgia pura,2
this song is the how the last day of school feels like,2
one of my fav s from back in the day still a masterpiece nothing these days touches the rap hip hop from the s i had a major crush on ice,2
y aun suena la mejor cancion,1
essa m sica me tr s uma nostalgia do crlh toda vez que escuto eu lembro de quando eu era crian a e ia pra lan house com meus amigos jogar gta sdds desse tempo viu,1
n o saio do carro se essa m sica estiver tocando muito foda muito bom mesmo,1
question is why would someone want to hide their rubiks cube that desperately,0
that s cool i also have a shashibo but i don t have enough to hide my cube unless i make it a hexagon,2
this is the type of infinity cube i want to see in my local shops,2
thats actually a really good use clever,2
this stuff never fails to confuse the heck out of me,0
this guy is a rubiks cube master,2
its not very secret its more of a storage system but still quite amazing,2
eventually his entire house will be a puzzle,1
imagine a quantum particle thing version of this where once you put those in you can solve the shape into a cube again,1
this content is amazing keep it up,2
which of these angry contestants got simon cowell to snap watch here,0
we know our cube is magic but this takes things to a whole new level,2
as a competitive cuber i can see how he does some of his tricks but still a ton of them are just insane,0
the real definition of talent hats off to this man master at his work,2
this guy deserved the finals at the least man his acts increased in complexity in each stage his presentation was nice he was polite as well indulged the judges in all the acts they were all genuinely suprised i dont know why he didnt get the chance thou,2
im speechless such a talent such a master of rubiks cube totally impressive,2
legends watch after years,1
i love this guy the artistry the presentation the judge influence and involvement this guy was meant to be a performer and he does it so well,2
i love when simon goes speechless with those expressions,2
over the years i went out on a quest across the world to find out how he does his magic tricks with the rubric cube and ive come back here to let you all know im still clueless,1
first the rubiks brand then magnetic then maglev and now smart cubes the evolution of rubiks cubes are taking a change for the better and its because of people like u spreading the message far and widelets show some love for the cubing youtube community,2
this is the cubing channel i watch so that my parents won t ask me what s that,1
the cube it honestly is really impressive and cool the games seem so fun and its definitely worth the price cuz of how long it took to make and how fun it looks if theres a x version of this my mind will completely blown away,2
non cubers wowyou can solve a rubiks cube cubers wowcube,2
tingman can i just thank you for everything you have done for the cubing community with wholesome amazing child friendly videos thank you so so much,2
tingman greetings from the inventor and founder of the company thank you for my taste you made the highest quality video review of the cube thanks a lot ilya osipov,2
kudos to the inventor what a cool idea the future starts now and if it s olor and tingboy approved it must be fun,2
you may never see this comment but if you do i just want to say thank you and all the other youtube cubers for inspiring me to become a cuber and i found my love for cubing i learned to solve x to x the rubik impossible and this very morning i got my first sub minute on my x at solve time of seconds and next week i be taking on the x mirror cube and im so grateful to the cubing community who is nothing but kind and supportive i cant wait to see what the cubing community has next in store for me and its been nearly months since i began my cubing hobby and i wish you jperm z cubing all the best and every other cubing youtuber i hope to some day be able to become a speed cuber and explore more cubes but thanks for inspiring me and bringing such amazing content to youtube all the best wishes to such kind people like you and all fellow cuber youtubers i truly found what im good at and what i love to do,2
i think that this is certainly a cube needed now it brings to fun things together that everyone loves and im sure it is sooo amazing to have,2
insane cube great video tingman k soon any comps coming up your competition vlogs are my favorite video,2
i like how kevins deals are so complicated that the brand owners basically exclude him from any possibility of doing a deal,1
lori is perfect for this show in general she s amazing with retail and products just like this plus she s great to watch,2
it always makes me laugh when mark gives one reason and then says for those reasons im out,2
you know i like that lori actually does a lot of business on the show,2
kevin i will give you k for barbara i will give you k for kevin that is so greedy,0
such a simple but great idea the best inventions are the ones that make you go why didnt i think of that,2
wow the roi for this must be insane creating a bigger sized ice cube tray and marketing it towards soups very smart,2
i ll make you an offer and for that reason i m out barbara,1
never knew lori had a golden ticket that s cool,2
mark saying souupeeer cuubees makes me laugh every time,2
lol just a day ago you say the rossolimo is a bad opening and the best chess engine plays it goes to show how bad you are at chess and how enormous the difference is,0
stockfish crushes itself then analyzes its mistakes what a gigachad,0
i personally love watching stockfish magnus leela and any other chess engines at your channel,2
stockfish awarding stockfish a brilliant move be like yes incredible i definitely would not have seen it,2
levy on tcec top chess engine championship there were some engine games with stockfish leela komodo etc where they played double fischer random chess dfrc essentially the pieces are randomized for both sides the games were extremely fascinating and often mind boggling you should check them out they are in the archive for s on dfrc i think,2
please keep these engine games coming levy like more from tcec engine games are always so fascinating because of how high level they are,2
i like this this should be a new series computer chess war or something,2
you should do stockfish vs again but have them swap sides after or moves see if the engine is strong enough to come from behind something like that be interesting to see how the strong engine plays from behind instead of ahead the whole way,1
three queens engines are just so sick great content with some teaching points for us carbon based units taking space and patience are key lessons thanks,2
i would like to see this game but giving time odds or processor odds to stockfish until it wins just to compare,1
magnus playing in titled tuesday and speed chess championship letss goooooooo,2
the first thing i thought when this video began was that magnus would probably be playing in the scc again damn i m excited,2
this is exciting apart from tt and scc theres a new global world championship too bad the rcc just finished imagine seeing magnus play every weekend against other strong players,2
yooooooo what always felt such a hole in the chess world with magnus not participating much in the big chesscom events just because of his other tie ups this is amazing,2
so we will see magnus in scc and some title tuesdays now thats a great news looking forward to see more magnus vs hikaru,2
imagine magnus commentating world championship alongside with caruanahikaru,1
itll be cool to see the magnus bots alongside the other top player bots on the site or even in a special areaapp,2
magnus is a pure business man,2
hikaru im very excited to abandon internet chess and go for classical tournaments again,2
its never about who bring magnus or hikaru at least for me its about free analysis and quicker and lighter website so i will always go with lichess,2
huge fan of hikaru giving us insight like this into the mindset of the super gm world fide reminds me of the intractability of major league baseball and their outdated traditions,1
anyone else want a magnus hikaru podcast where they both dunk on fide or is it just me,1
hikaru himself is proof of why online chess is so important to grow the game lol kinda explains itself,2
hikarus video speaks for itself,1
i think they are upset from magnus because he is not defending his world championship title because of which they will suffer revenue losses less people will see ding vs nepo compared to magnus vs nepo less ads less sponsorship less online viewership etc,0
hikaru continually having magnus back and showing him great respect is why despite his flaws i am still a hikaru fan,2
i prefer esports chess it looks cooler more comfortable for the players and they can move faster,2
i also take playing random moves less slowly than my opponent extremely seriously,1
emils perspective is a classic example of the fallacy of zero sum thinking where shallow thinkers believe that when one side wins the other necessarily losses of course when it comes to things like chess this kind of thinking is completely erroneous and on the contrary when one side wins both sides win what is good for one aspect of chess is broadly speaking good for chess as a whole we should be doing everything possible to broaden chesss appeal garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process what is good for online chess is also good for otb chess fide and other large bureaucratic institutions will hopefully eventually recognize and embrace this too,1
fair criticisms on both sides however online chess played while ft away from your opponent is just ridiculous,0
the monsterous power of the bishop pair demonstrated with elegant moves and amazing game,2
amazing attacking game i thought once grieve lost the exchange it would be a slow conversion for white but that bishop pair was really sick i love it whenever i get a bishop fortified by a pawn behind it so deep into the position its like a thorn in the opponents play easily worth an exchange,2
hopefully they dont ruin chessable is the only good product that playmagnus has,2
this reminds me of nezhmetdinovs bishop pair against chernikov,1
it would be interesting to see how stockfish would win the game as white especially white was up material but finding moves was the hard part,1
danny rensch taking over play magnus is chesss version of elon musk buying twitter,1
chesscom has become the chess equivalent of disney,1
magnus owns of play magnus the bid is nok m so he gets nok m equivalant to approx usd million not bad,2
suggestion ivan sokolov vs tiger hillarp persson koge open denmark a wild and beautiful tactical game involving queen sacrifice and an awesome mating net definitely deserves a video do check it out,2
that really is an amazing game white material advantage blacks ruined structure but the bishop pair and a long king walk to finish a great game with promotions on both sides and a queen sac,2
the goal should be to get better not look for simple openings good luck getting to just playing the englund traxler ponziani staffford and danish gambit maybe this advice holds true for those who have a game accuracy or centipawn loss in their min games but not for more advanced players,1
objectively the bongcloud opening must be the most horrendous of options however at the same time it is hikarus trademark bongcloud is beyond good and evil,0
bong cloud has one variation super easy to learn and surprises the opponent has to be the top openings,2
i think the point gotham is making especially with the ruy lopez sicilian is that openings of that caliber require such precision and accurate play that unless youre willing to really spend a lot of time with minute details and study youre going to play them wrong even if you win games with them itll be in spite of your opening not because of it generally speaking hes clearly talking about beginner intermediate caliber players chess purists can relax,1
just wanna point out something interesting the alapin variation of the sicilian defence with c and d is the exact reverse of the main line variation of the english opening with c d both of them are bad for the one playing against them please listen to this man and take some of his advice to heart,0
you should make a series of this for different rating tiers,1
my man levy just had mvl on his podcast then takes a massive dump on all of mvls openings for black,0
accepting the queens gambit still remains to be my most traumatic experience in chess i remember innocently grabbing that pawn and immediately regretting playing chess,0
qga player here i kept running into literally the exact problems you listed in that section of the video recently i tried the benko gambit in one game to see how well it would do had a completely dominant position after like moves excellent video as always keep it up,2
i have been playing the gr nfeld for sometime now and honestly against lower its not that bad if you do a little study won very good games with c,2
what a sunday champion vs challenger magnus vs pragnnandha its going to be a cracker,2
im pretty sure this wasnt actually the case but it almost looked like magnus made a bet maybe with himself that he could make x number of moves with his queen and y number of moves with his king and still win or maybe just still reach move that would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateurlike play this might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke but i suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the nba or nfl or mlb some persons would be calling for an investigation just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the carlsen firouzja match note how strangely carlsen played in game four was it of his match with pragg i dont know how much las vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy in some ways it was embarrassing to watch i dont believe that type of behavior advanced the cause of pro chess,1
everyone was so worried about him magnus not taking it seriously when he showed clearly it didnt matter how you look during a match the board speaks for itself to my fellow chess playersplay the board not the person also if they didnt want anyone expressing theyre facial expressions and such they would have made the tournament traditional and face to face this chess society has so much to improve on when it comes to just playing the board the point of this game is whose mind is stronger who ever has the advantage in the meta wins always wake up chess world,1
i wonder who simon is supporting it is hard to tell i wish all players the best of luck in the next round,2
loving levons shirt,2
well done duda,2
best move of the tournament,2
chess speaks for itself,1
jovanka singing,2
learning to avoid high interest debt while also learning how to put your money to work for you by investing is a very powerful combo especially when you learn young the earlier you start investing your money and putting it to work the more time compound interest has to work its magic on your portfolio this is how im going to achieve early retirement and its possible for everyone all you need to do is learn and start,2

mom let me explain how my brother died so nf qg bh qf checkmate,1
interesting fact chaturanga in indonesia becomes catur which also mean i believe it was adopted from sanskrit word check is called sekak which usually fit in to javanese language,1
this story clearly shows how people of ancient world were so interested in intelligence otherwise it would have been very hard for this great intellectual game to exist for thousands of years,1
minecraft players complain that they need updates chess i dont have such weaknesses,0
i feel so frustrated with the king piece like the whole kingdom is trying to save you and you just move one square at a time like you dont give a damn,0
no wonder why indians are so good in mathematics and chess games,2
i like the indian chess piece but how other countrys play chess is also fascinating,2
chaturanga chatur means anga means a partdivision edit chatur also means clever,2
chess is not only a game its emotion,2
imagine all this history and the final chapter is charlie beating xqc in moves,1
this is brilliantly done congrats,2
im beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity theres place of brashness boldness creativity fear light touch nimbleness anger bluffs it is a beautiful game rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics it has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one how many more things are possible in a game how far ahead can pieces support each other how deep and farseeing ideas can be and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions,2
holy guacamole that was amazing easily one of the best documentaries ive ever seen please do more about chrss history its what the chess community needs to realize this game isnt just magnus and supercomputers finding the best moves but actual styles of play and players that for so long determined the game,2
chess clock brief history would be good to have been included in this documentary how would one classify classical chess against rapid chess without clock nevertheless this is such a good film finally a chess film that has filled the void,2
this is so wonderfully made hope this could become a series and will include the history of the fide openings schools of thought international tournaments ratings title etc thanks again,2
chess is and forever will be a timeless endearing game that will forever captivate the human mind long may it reign in thousands of years to come,2
such a fascinating game and really the only game i have ever gotten so interested in the elo system is inspiring because it gives you a goal,2
fyi also anand started learning chess from age six from his mother but he learned the intricacies of the game in manila where he lived with his parents from through the s while his father was contracted as a consultant by the philippine national railways,1
this is amazing i love documentaries and chess and they came together on my birthday lucky me,2
this is by no means a history of chess just a history of chess world champions there is a lot more that is more general and more interesting than who exactly beat whom in how many games,2
bullet chess took on a whole new meaning,1
just for those who are new to chess the towers are rooks the horses are knights the diagonal ones are bishops then obviously the king and queen and pawns,1
chess pieces pawn the very first line of attack can move spaces forward only on the first move while only moving spaces forward the next move takes enemys pieces if the pieces is in leftright side in front can be promoted into any pieces except king if a pawn got into the last tile of the enemys side knight moves in an l shape can jump over pieces bishop can move in an x shape can go for how long you want it to be cant jump over pieces rook can go in a shape can go for how long you want it to be cant jump over pieces you can do a move called castle if your rook can reach the king and both pieces havent move dont know if that last part is right queen can go in a and x shape cant jump over pieces king can move spaces around it like a square protect this piece as best as you can a checkmate will be an immediate lose cant jump over pieces,1
its so funny to just watch them randomly move pieces with no concept of popular chess strategies and openings lol,2
can we all appreciate how ssundees content never fails to amaze us,2
never imagined ssundee playing chess,0
what s up ian just wanted to say i ve been here since around the time you started your ftb modded survival series with lanceypooh you have been a big impact on my life and no matter how old i get i ll be sticking around i love you man keep doing what you want to do and making people happy,2
rooks can move in straight lines left and right or up and down but cant jump over other pieces bishops can move diagonally as far as it wants as long as there is no pieces in the way of it knights the only piece that can jump other pieces and can move in the shape of an l king can only move time in any direction is known as the most important piece but also the most useless queen can move as far as she wants in any direction as long as theres not a piece blocking her small edit she is also known as the strongest piece on the board pawns pawns can move forwards times on the first turn but only once after that on following turns and can only kill moving diagonally forward if the pawn reaches the opponents side of the board you can substitute it for any of your former pieces lost ie if you lost the queen you could bring the queen back by getting a pawn to the opponents side i hope i didnt miss anything also i hope this helps oh and a side note white always goes first,1
whenever he didn t know what the pieces were called i died a little sorry i just love chess,2
finally a chess it s taken literal centuries,2
you made chess this is brilliant,2
unironically seems like an improvement to me,2
so a fish can kill a bear but a bear cant kill a fish sounds reasonable,1
fun fact about the monkey theres a chess variant called congo which has a piece also called monkey with the exact same movement except it captures the pieces it jumps over so they can only be of the opposite color instead of the last one,1
someone is inevitably going to make a playable online chess and i cannot wait,2
i feel like this would legitimately be a fun variation on chess,2
i love this new update it implements a rework for basically every card and a new middle piece a jail system which is very cool and adds incetives to protect and keep alive the monkey since he can save the king giving him a great passive buff also the fish queens that even now are fake is still a great advantage to have and i personally like more that way and the new rook with his flying abilities making a great way to protect other pieces and more gameplay variety and finally a little edit to the color of the chess board who i agree the reasoning for tho is probably harder to get a blueish board than a black and white one but is not a big issue and after mentioning all of that i will give to this update a amazing work,2
i can t wait to see someone try to make this playable in tabletop simulator as a d artist i ll even go as far as to start modeling the pieces themselves when i have time lol,2
there should be a special move thats the equivalent of castling in chess,1
i know you made this as a joke but this actually does seem like a fun variant of chess edit i forgot to mention this but i think it need bird from egypt,2
noobs you are lucky that gothamchess exists,2
yeah i just choose my openings based on how cool the name is,2
me moves a pawn one space forward chess theorists ah yes a classic pythagoras last stand a popular tactic but easily countered by an istanbul thrust,1
what i learned from this video confuse the enemy with weird moves until they do something dumb,0
every other chess youtube channel serious explanation of intricate theory levy winrate nice,2
i cant claim that i understand everything in this video but i now understand the importance of choosing an opening and a defense to master as a beginner in order to get a deeper understanding of how to progress in my learning this video is exactly what i and probably all beginners need knowing how to know good pedagogy,2
i recently finished watching the queens gambit on netflix and its made me want to re enter the chess world i was first introduced to chess when i was years old but unfortunately my focus the next few years was on schoolive now almost graduated college and i discovered this channel and ive binged many of the videos great work and thank you for teaching chess,2
im rated in puzzlestacticsand only in games i always am getting caught in terrible positions and find myself blundering often andor in terrible positions you are pumping out some solid content my man this video hit home for me and im hopeful after some opening study i can begin to correct my mistakes and find myself in better positions thank u great vid,2

thanks for the good notes for your info in iraq we play in two methods western eastern chess game modes western is the one you guys playing it while eastern white q face black k white k face black q pawn moves one step only and castling is not possible,1
thank you sir for this video and the others i have used it today after watching your video and it works well smashing the like god bless you in jesus name i hope you safe there in your country,2
nh attacks the queen qe or qd looses the queen after nf game over,1
solution to midvideo puzzle white again plays nf ch if ke or kd nh dis ch picks up at least the exchange possibly a whole rook depending on where blacks king goes if kf bh wins the exchange as well,1
what a coincidence i was just playing the scotch opening,2
i guess solution for little puzzle is like thisknight h queen has more options g square e and d all of this moves lead them lose their queen after whites move knight f and queen is gone,1
alireza firouzja is my compatriot he is of iranian origin but has french citizenship and plays for the french flag although firouzcha is a very good chess player but he does not give iranians any practice i learn a lot from you and your tutorials thank you very much for that,2
i greet you from iranyour teachings are very usefulthank you so much,2
he did illegal move and minutes later he trying to capture king gm,1
total illegal moves in one match with a cm and im,1
how the hell this guy is gm and captures king has no knowledge about new fide rules where illegal are ending the game,0
that s how you shouldn t behave in a chess game black just plays intolerant and aggressively touches on the clock i hate that,0
eric needs to let go of the fear of losing and start to believe in himself and be truthful to his style he should not have even bidden and take white i am sure he would have won when there is no theory he is one of the best because he is pure creativity un saludo desde espa a crack,1
eric did so good that armageddon game is kinda screwed up white was given so much time min advantage i guess he needed that to beat eric,2
congrats fedoseev and gl,2
you put the result in the thumbnail of another video so ruins the entertainment completely thanks,0
that s sad,0
best group of hosts ever makes it a delight every time and howell is outstanding,2
i really like hans zimmers music and i loved ivankas super advice about paying attention to negative thought and practicing meditation jovanka is doing a good job and apparently she is an interesting person to say the least,2
what chemistry among these commentators what learning and fun for us lowerrated amateurs congrats david on your olympiad medal way to show the flag of england hope you can still do commentary now and then if you join the chess tour and if you join may your skills take you to god bless,2
congratulations again to david howell,2
david deserves a gold metal for his commentary as well,2
anish giri does love studying chess theory so the prospect that he might still be in opening preparation in game does not surprise me that much,2
i followed the olympiad and was floored by davids performance there were over teams each with around players so there must have been if not more players in the open division not one of them played more successfully than david howell moreover his efforts went a long way towards giving england a top finish congratulations david howell i was very happy for you,2
would love to see judit polgar david howell commenting that would be great,2
btw i also saw jovanka on camera once while she was playing in the olympiad it was good to see her compete for her country england as well,2
lets go pragg,2
the amount of times eric has made this joke and explained that he didnt actually say it just makes it all the more funny haha,2
was following the game live online curious to see how your qgd panned out i couldnt work out why the clocks werent moving and the last few moves were missing this explains it thanks,1
that would have been an epic otb stalemate i d love to see an engine analysis at the end of these to see any missed opportunities or where you went wrong,1
eric love your stalemate attempt hope your opponent could see the fun of it lol,2
thank you for another enjoyable recap you seem moderately exhausted and mildly disheartened but the fact of the matter is you kept it close against an experienced gm that bodes well for the future if you decide to make a harder push for gm at some point good luck in your remaining rounds,2
i got a stalemate trap over the board once it was against a rated player and he was living on a increment it was a little more elaborate than your one i had to sacrifice the queen but he had no way to stop it and i got so excited i lost the ability to speak for the next min and i was just thinking about you all the time so thank you for that point eric,2
prior to the mark of your video i was amazed you two were both still blitzing out your moves then the reveal,2
he played it somewhere in so its fresh in my mind,1
i love your vicious traps and lines i feel like you play so different from most players,2
i tried to react naturally and played kd lol that got me,1
magnus just wants to have fun he could have won pragg so humble,2
the earned by hans really speak for themselves honestly this was one of the more fun chess tournaments than usual unbelievable blunders backfiring trashtalk internet crash computer crash and what not,0
im sure that your timestamps must have helped millions,2
magnus is becoming a content creator at this point doing goofy stuff keeping us entertained,2
magnus pragg truly ending the crypto cup by giving the viewers an amazing show to watch with twists and turns every single move,2
found it timestamp to magnus game,2
timestamps hans vs liem hans vs liem levon vs alireza duda vs anish giri pragg vs magnus rapid magnus won pragg vs magnus rapid pragg won pragg vs magnus t blitz pragg vs magnus t blitz final game,1
i feel bad for hans i can understand his chess speak for itself he was exited and who wont be exited in that situation he just won a game against the best player of all time,1
this is like a cow is on a highway levy you and your humor are the things for which we patiently wait hours until your new video upload,2
let the chess speak for itself hans choke niemann,1
welcome everyone the beginners course is out now on my website,2
i have been a beginner for yrs i am professional beginner beginner master expert in finding win for my opponent,1
believe it or not i m getting a bit emotional watching this i was fascinated by chess as a kid but i was useless at it and got discouraged my dad tried to teach me but that mostly involved a lot of yelling swearing and tears this is the first time i ve seen someone explain the game with such clarity enthusiasm patience and obvious love for the game at hopefully this is the beginning of a new chess journey for me thankyou so much,2
finally a video that has explained the concept of chess properly for beginners i have tried to learn for years and could not find anyone who had the ability to explain this to me thank you so much gothamchess,2
i havent played for yearsneeded a refresher thank you levi for a very informative and entertaining instructional video you are a natural and easygoing teacher entertainer hello from australia,2
you have an awesome way of keeping a total newbie engaged and not feeling totally lost thank you looking forward to getting started,2
very helpful i learned how the pieces moved decades ago as a kid but i never learned concepts like piece vision protecting pieces tactics vs strategies etc i taught myself a bit of these through playing but i have many holes in my understanding,2
i have huge anxiety starting to play with other people started off marking huge mistakes but im making fewer mistakes and learning what to do instead of what i did start off really improved,2
i ve always loved chess even since i was a kid but i always found it too hard to remember the moves and rules when i was younger but being older now i ve rediscovered how much i love it and this video really helped me get back into the swing of things and was also really informative i ve subscribed and i ll be checking out your other videos to help me along the way thank you,2
i used to play chess with my uncles when i was a kid recently got back into it with my little brother and this video has been very helpful in refreshing my memory,2
that boi snapped on this bih he definitely done stepped it up a level,2
stumbled on to this video by mistake never heard of this guy but i m liking the flow much success to you my guy,2
i m playing this shit times already this boy is str smoke,0
trap n yella punching the air on that drizzy bar this song snappin,2
this mf song is gonna stay on repeat long live osama,2
this shit sound like some cash money bounce with that texas swang this shit bang ll tho fr,1
much you killed it big homie the laugh at the end gets me every time i cant help but laugh too,2
texas really got mad underrated rappers they gon wake up sooner or later fashitsho,1
ima get it all back in blood or whatever poohshiesty said,1
hell yeah coming with that heat,2
hope lichess remains as the forbidden platform to the sell outs who cant even mention the name lichess in stream lichess has the sleekest interface out there,1
btw arjun won against wang hao today and becomes india passing hari and gukesh wins and gets back to world with and nihal with todays win crosses pragg with rating,1
lichess does not care it is nonprofit open source its developer made lichess as part time job and lichess updates are made by him and some more developers in their free time,1
the similarity between lichess and sahil is they stand out between other platforms and also have less subscriber and low net worth perfectly made for each other,2
first time an im defeated a world champion so easily,1
the offer values pmg at around million,1
erik and daniel being gujarati also magnus and samay continuous stream incoming,1
tickoo bhai time to start your own chess company to break this monopoly,1
heartbreaking and then leko wiping his eyes at chess at its most emotional,1
love the commentary from leko great to have lawrence with him they make a great pair would love to see leko on the main stream,2
wow peter really had tears for pragg after the heartbreak of a game for him amazing how chess players can feel each others pain and everyone does like pragg,2
great to see lawrence back and he seems new and improved well maybe not new but improved,2
peter leko is a very sweet guy in the way he speaks,2
i just dont think magnus takes chess very seriously anymore and thats his right were still thrilled to have him distracted still very entertaining and insightful still a great contributor to the chess world,2
peter leko pragyanantha good effort man,2
magzy unstoppable,2
lawrence trent reminds me of peter o hanrahahanrahan leko is trying to analyze and he s rambling about other stuff,1
would it be possible to make sure that the players board eval bar is never removed from the screen theres a lot of times where were showing the analysis board and the faces of the playerscommentators and thats terrible for me because i cant see whats happening in the real game what the current eval is and do my own thoughts plus theres really no need to see all faces and not see the board,0
thats why magnus really wanted to face a new generation player in the wcc since he knew they had more chances than the players of his generation its just like other tournaments even if magnus loses some games he still won the tournament looking forward to praggnanandha an amazing performance for him,2
magnus carlsen is the goat congrats to praggim sure he will be the new world champion,2
so happy for pragg i was thinking push your pawns pragg at the end game please push your pawns and when he finally started doing that he had much better winning chances well done,2
pragg continuing to be the comeback king amazing play he made this tournament extremely exciting was just glued to all his games and magnus also played really well at the start but i lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely he couldnt even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested the least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so its not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him rlly left a bitter taste but im soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring,2
firouzja and pragganandhaa are both playing very well at this age the future is in the hands of these two young men but i cant say which one,2
pragg i was lucky today to win the th game magnus i did not have good sleep yesterday lol,2
pragg what a champ so young yet so talented the next anand for sure,2
aronian has such a great attitude towards the game of chess such a gentleman,2
levon aronian is by far my favourite player excellent att chess of course but a really nice and likeable person too,2
i wish you guys would cover more than just one game per round switch around and explore several games,2
hans interview is even funnier because hes not even its literally illegal for him in miami to hit the mini bar,1
it looked like aronian was just exhausted in game and wanted to be done with it else those last moves with so much time dont make much sense for a player of his quality,0
chess didnt speak it was screaming in pragg vs lev,1
chess needs more funding seriously the best of the minds are fighting it out there should be more prize money for each of them,2
pragg,2
you came for this interview,1
now that pragg has beaten levon aronian who would pragg be playing in day,1
pragg is amazing playereven aronian smile when he lost to pragg and magnus also smile when he lost that final game to praggit is show that you are great player if opponent smile when they lost to you,2
leko is just the best asset of chess d what a machine,2
pragg the mountain goat the world is awakening to tamils mental prowness equal to the best and nd to none let the chess speak for itself you aint seen nothing yet,2
winning a high level tournament while chilling and enjoying a comedy podcast magnus seems to have found the right combination of workchill,2
magnus the wins another event the man just can t stop winning one event after another,2
great event,2
magnus looked little disinterested he may have thought he was winning anyway,1
you can t rlly blame him he missed a mate in with seconds left,0
magnus is the biggest heart of chess player he delibrately lost himself at the final he won the tournament and won everything actually the true winner is someone who gives the winning to those who more needed magnus did and always does taking knight e are you kidding,2
bring wesley back and give a shot to raunak better than pragg the next vishy,2
and magnus introduced the new laughing gambitbut tbh magnus such a beast even he blunders somewhere hell find all good moves after and manages to holdprag too well played n not pushed too muchgg,2
agad humour is why we love this channel the tongue in cheek comment in timestamps the knight making fancy moves to pick up the pawn the inside joke on the b square man it makes my day,2
pragg and carlsen are making the best games in the whole tournament,2
and now the knight will just use some fancy moves and the movement of knight on the screen,1
everytime i saw hans at points i always remember chess speaks for itself,1
magnus the bandit,1
im glad the timestamps have returned i typically jump to the first timestamp given it is typically where the game starts so i still heard what you said antonio i see you p,2
i love antonios philosophy moments like this one about the time stemp people who will never know what he has said,2
woah so many double takes throughout this match every time i glanced away magnus slipped out of another hairy situation magnus is a magician,2
kings indian defense carlsen is cheeky the chess king is defending vs an indian,1
the main reason i like alex is because she is genuinely interested in people and pays attention to them when they speak tell stories etc very rare nowadays imo,2
trash talker snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,0
he didnt miss the move just wanted to keep the game going,1
what a turnaround plus this was a particularly good video because she sort of interviewed him about his lifes experience with chess so its a trash talk gamewith an interview alex is juggling three things during this video liked the written commentary tips as well,2
man he messed that one up so so bad had a free rook and totally threw his advantage right in the eternal bowels of fire hell,0
love how you tell him he is not hitting the clock right could waste your time while he is making a move and he won t change so you start hitting the clock twice two too funny,0
i was born as an orphan lost me right at the start,0
after that moment when he started talking shit into the camera he fell apart lol classic overconfidence right there,0
amazing comeback i really tought that taking the rook still will give him a win but in the end that didnt help and wow really nice to see that you didnt collapse to time pressure thats for sure inspiring great gaming from both d,2
great game alexandra love the irl chess streams and tournaments keep up the good work,2
me after watching this video grandmasters im coming for you,1
levy wheres the piece gonna go me thats movefromnow mes problem,1
that fake training tip has given me an epiphany about everything i do in life thank you levy,2
i started at in april and i played so badly that my friends made me a laughing stock whenever i play together with them i decided to subscribe to your channel put some effort to study openings i pick solely london for white and either kid or scandi for black and in months i went up to i stagnated between until august so i decided to learn more from you consequently i start winning and blunder games started to be a habit around november in december i reached and after now i am finally at the digit mark thank you levy youre such a great teacher,1
local sight is a common mistake at least for me at fast time controls you focus your attention on a specific area of the board and just forget that far beyond a long range piece is defending a square you judge unprotected,0
continuity the board changes every move you make lesson learned every step you take levy is watching you,1
dude the fake training tip really does apply to everything i ve been practicing life drawing every day but just mindlessly putting marks on paper without internalizing new concepts no wonder why i haven t improved in quite a while thanks for opening my eyes gotham,0
i ve started late in life at and i ve been paying for a year now i decided to get better after i got so angry during lock down playing with my husband that i felt sooo silly then watching your videos over and over made a big difference and in the last couple of months i ve had some pretty amazing breakthrough so thank you,2
this was more than a chess lesson this was a life lesson thank you levy,2
this video is exactly what the doctor ordered for me i am guilty of all of these im overly fake trained on puzzles with an overconfidence and overinflated puzzle rating but in online games im getting my ass handed to me by players because of all these mistakes time to do a major reset i made a post it cheat sheet on these mistakes and will keep it in front of me as i play future online games time to get back to completing all the opening courses i have on chessable thanks levi,0
she really said good thing my sister is not here the dad said she ll lose too what a savage,0
i lost in four moves to my year old son once i felt very humbled and a bit foolish he was beaming with triumph at having defeated his dad at chess,2
dear andrea i was thoroughly impressed by your welcoming warm attitude and your gracious and warm attitude when you lost i think that the way you played and engaged young kai will stay with him for the rest of his life you may not be at this time the number one chess player in the world but i think youre doing something far more important youre winning the hearts of these children and that is a gift that will stay with them for life thank you for sharing,2
i love how they just had fun and kept smiling i do wonder how well they would have done if not multitasking,2
what a wonderful young lady you are to work with children and a big congratulations to the young man he was so happy while playing,2
i still remember the last chess tournament i played in i competed against opponents at the same time while blindfolded lost every game gotta have goals,0
this is just a simple respectful game of chess and i love it that kid is great i support him,2
cara isso foi muito bom sentir sentimentos e energias maravilhosas kkkk,1
that was a perfect show of great sportsmanship hats off to both the players,2
damn bro prag is goddamn great at endgame he doesnt do a single mistake even if he is low on time magnus narrowly escaped but anyway great days for him,2
so nice that at the end levon and jan walked together to talk to svene great sportsmanship something hans should learn from,2
i said it a million times and i will always do david howel is the most underrated chess player in the whole world the sharpness of this guy and the speed he spots the perfect moves is not something you can ignore also i watch this show because of david i can always check the matches results anywhere but i always come here just to watch david and simon my favorite chess players,2
daved jovanka kaja simon you are the best thank you you made me love chess,2
omg why we were treated to davids rare voice of emphatic unequivocal disapproval for dudas breach of davids most cherished endgameprinciple do not rush rook endgames,1
a huge congrats david well done cheers kev,2
i am so happy for david achievement million congratulations,2
congrats david what a legend,2
great cast as always,2
magnus shows the kid how chess speaks for itself,1
i had the honor of speaking personally with ren letelier and he was a true gentleman the great thing about him is that he became an international master without even being a professional chess player he worked in a bank and in his free time or vacations he played tournaments regarding this game he mentioned that he just enjoyed every move that fischer made on the board letelier played times against fischer being defeated times and beating bobby time sorry my english its not my first language,2
we love jerrys videos his analysis is excellent jerry we hope you will review some of the games at this years candidates tournament,2
i really liked the way the game was described each move was analyzed with possible options giving the viewer opportunity to see how fischer developed his strategy some commentators are too fast too slick this was much better,2
jerry your videos are some of the most instructive on the internet my top favorite youtubers are you gotham and daniel naroditsky gotham teaches you how to understand broad overarching concepts like a master daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master and you teach us how to realize what masterlevel thinking even looks like seriously i studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldnt advance past but your beginner to gm series totally revolutionized the way i looked at the board i gained more in the years since i watched those videos than i did in my previous years of serious chess study,2
what a beautiful game i ve never seen this before one of the many reasons bobby fischer may have been the greatest player ever,2
i think im speaking in name of every one here when i say we need more videos jerry we love your videos,2
hey jerry been watching you for more than years now and i pretty much owe you my accent thanks for the chess analysis and english that you have taught me during this huge period of time and i really would like to see your face while listening to you please keep it in your mind you are excellent take care,2
im certainly not a good chess player i think your narration was perfect it gave me insights as to what the great players are thinking its the best chess video ive seen thanx,2
quality over quantity watching your powerful well thought analysis always shows me youre on another level thanks for your effort,2
i was just thinking yesterday man it s been a while since jerry uploaded always a joy to see you uploading especially the analysis vids,2
massive respect to jeffrey for sportsmanship,2
this playoff series and game match format is absolutely insane,2
i wished wesley played in the candidates you said it danya,1
ggs the semi matchups are so good,2
smells like wesley vs ian to me,2
oh the broadcast of the faces are so delayed you don t see hikaru reacting to his own blunder until the guy responds to the move in real time hikaru had the same reaction as danya as soon as he played the move haha i hate when they happens right as you let go of the piece you see why it s bad,0
wesley trollin d chair,1
getting gooood,2

smells like hikaru vs ian finals,1
magnus power is unbelievable he even took over agadmators mind for a second and made him bongcloud,2
when agadmator played king e by mistake that was the brilliancy that we hoped to see,2
alireza is the carocann master he knows all the variations,1
the way alirezas bishop and rook coordinated to keep harassing carlsens queen was magical,2
not sure which i like more watching magnus win or watching him lose either way its great to watch,2
magnus has become so good hes just trying random things god level,2
since i started watching your channel the phrase threatens nasty discoveries has been lodged so deep in my mind i will be dreaming it constantly till i die,0
the coordination of white s pieces in this game was beautiful,2
and its now as of move seven that we have a completely new gamewho else likes this line from agad,2
play the opening like a book the middle game like a magician and the endgame like a machine which is true except the book magnus chose was cat in the hat,1
danny is great games,2
this is one of the best chess games i have ever watched the other one was here too in the same park fun friendly relaxed and brilliant thanks anna you are a real champion,2
thats my cousin always had a kind heart and always loved chess while we were goofing around as kids i would watch that boy read chess books and wash grown men im so proud of you man,2
she said danny plays an aggressive style but actually if you look he is quite positional loves the two bishops and throws in an h to throw off his opponent he tries to make make very tiny advantages that eventually point at your king i simply love his playing style,2
im so impressed by danny s ability to delay castles in both games he seems very aware of the positional advantages that he can take by delaying,2
anna love the videos suggestions itd be awesome if you could show the clock somehow maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video if you or opponent resign a second explanation of why it was resigns at the end would be awesome in this case i saw your b on a was hanging and whites rook defending their e bishop but its not always super easy for us to figure out,2
anna took two losses in a row and was laughing and having fun with a strong player its amazing to watch two pros go neck and neck at each other like this thank you so much,2
other than an amazing player danny seems really modest and kind i wish i was living anywhere near these kinds of parks i love how its nice weather people casually walking by and stop to spectate the game it kind of restores my faith in this world,2
gotta love chess how does a random dude in the park casually crush a fm with a lifetime of training and world famous gm parents she earns my respect for posting this,2
need a danny youtube his play style would be really fun to watch consistently,2
also interesting for curious people pragg has been called as grunfeld slayer by gm howell as he has won of his games as white against it,2
pragg is becoming my favorite chess player still love chuckys games but pragg is putting in that work and making magic happen on the board,2
prag is a monster i hope he will become one day wc i love this guy he is a nice person and so humble indians peoples can be proud of him,2
pragg in yesterdays interview i just want to play a better chess tommorow and he did play it,2
never get stuck on a vs the man with as in his name quote above the board for their next game,1
pragg plays a sneaky rook move aronian pushes a pawn antonio hello everyone,1
pragg taking no prisoners,1
pragg vs magnus is getting the hype as they are the only players unbeaten on all rounds,2
its actually game of the fischer larsen match of ive been searching for that incredible game thanks for the heads up on it i remember back in the day on my chessmaster library yasser seirawan described it beautifully when he said the bishop pair had two jobs one to guard the king and two to shepherd the a pawn home a masterclass,2
and just a few minutes before the child has defeated levon in the final match also it was as awesome as this one or better than this one,2
watching eric destroy his opponents while dancing is one of the best things i have ever seen in chess you will not play alone in the final the boys are with you lets goooooo,2
this is how chess should be played,1
eric hansen on god mode go eric one of my favorite streamers,2
daniel will he have the cojones to go for it oo,1
shimanov sure looks a lot like fedoseev to me,1
eric also beat hikaru at drunken lawn wrestling,2
great job,2
eric hansen is this theory,1
put some respeck on my name fischer random,1
i love you danya but every time you say girl i cringe please stop,1
watch till the end for the twist,2
to help him get better this crowd of people traumatised him for life this narration is gold,1
the computer couldnt comprehend his selfsacrificing move yeah because kings cant move into check,0
inventor i feel bad so we could either a ill pay for therapy and some extra money to help him recover or b we can organize an elaborate death game that will require a whole bunch of set pieces actors and effects to traumatize him a different way wife i like b lets do b,0
this is the nd part of a japanese anthology film first one is a horror episode rd one is a comedy and the last one i think is a romance scifi overall a great film and it introduced me to the awesomeness of nonhollywood content since i watched it years ago this recap makes me want to rewatch the film again thanks,2
i really loved the ending accepting ones mistakes without hesitations is a true winner of all winners,2
i really was expecting a really messed up ending where the wife actually never loved him or something like that didnt expect it to be a wholesome ending great stuff,0
lmao the computer couldnt understand the kings sacrifice move that gm vidit gujrathi made against hikaru and selfdestruct,0
grandmaster vs computer super blue first player to lose a computer well thats just movie version of happened in where grandmaster gary kasparov lost to deep blue,0
this was absolutely priceless and brilliant this really made my day thank you great narration too thanks for making me laugh in the car as a bishop with a rook key ring hahahaha i love you japan,2
great production great coverage and a show that is so levelled that you can watch it while you are busy doing other things thanks chess,2
liem is the opposite of niemann polite smiley and composed,0
hans also played well he could have gone for a draw think he wanted to go for a win and lost best wishes to him too,2
awkwardthe interview is happening with the sponsor just when the carlsenaronian game has the champion sac a queen lol hard to cut away from the sponsor when that happens murphys law in action,0
man feels bad for anishhope he comes strong tomorrow also hans is playing superb fighting games,1
,1
magnus sacs queen,1
praggananda is great,2
omgit just popped into my head that anish giri looks like michael jackson,2
great,2
levon hangs mate in and also loses in moves he definitely adheres to the philosophy of never let them know your next move,1
hope hans is fine hes a good player its always fun to watch his games a bit of trash talk never harmed nobody,2
at this point hans niemanns chess has stopped speaking now its screaming in pain,0
we keep saying its the magnus effect not talking about basketballs and dams here but would be interesting to test this in an esport i follow age of empires one player theviper was so dominant for so long that a streamer t official came up with the idea of an event he called hidden cup where everyones identities were hidden and only revealed at the end each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who was a really interesting concept as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who theyve repeated the format times now which says something about how loved it is but with chess being an online thing now this kind of event is very possible and i think would be fascinating would magnus still win theviper did so proved that theory wrong at least for him,2
if he was winning nobody would be talking very true wordshopefully hans will comeback,2
don t lose your queen in moves me who gambited my queen in moves yeah this is big brain time,1
chess solved low elo getting mated in how to lose at chess gm getting mated in chess speaks for itself,1
imagine being an grand master who does not lose any games and also being an gm that loses in moves,1
game was insane all praggu needed was a draw and he pulls out an untested gambit then sacrifices a second pawn the chess world is changing doesn t he know he s supposed to play the berlin and force a draw,0
actually levon was up by minutes i think maybe if he thought more he couldve squeezed a victory,1
i still can t believe he gets the privilege of playing with the best chess player in the world magnus sure is a lucky man,2
magnuss reactions are hilarious he looks genuinely shocked by some of the moves ludwig plays,2
i love how excited magnus gets when ludwig plays the move he wanted,2
magnus lowkey biological chess engine also magnus complete memelord,1
crazy that lud is wellknown enough in the chess community that he can collab with the greatest in the world,2
magnus reaction when ludwig does a bad move or blunder is comedy we need more magnus and ludwig collars edit i hate autocorrect,0
ludwig plays moves that are elo ahead also ludwig misses a hanging rook,1
magnus must be so happy to play with the best chess player in the world happy for him,2
what if we get a little crazy magnus you can t talk about crazy on every single move lol,1
candidates participants i have to train the hardest i ever have to be able to play against magnus for his title magnus,0
online chess is far inferior to normal chess i can t flip the board in anger,0
black moves pawn to a me good move eric ok this is the first big blunder,0
chess does not improve focus it worsens it everytime i try to do something i want to play chess so i cant focus on the task at hand,0
if you hang all of your pieces at once your opponent cant take them all sun tzu art of war,1
me beginner movin a pown steps gm hes traying the harscan taktic on me me moves a secound pown gm no way he switched from harscan tactic to the dubbel pown menuever me who has no idea what i did feeling my self,1
this guys memory is wild he can recall that he was in this exact position against this specific player like years ago,1
oh so cool gg eric i was hoping to at least make you think a bit harder but oh well haha,2
considering how lopsided this game was materialwise black held on for an amazing amount of time,2
id say sleep and exercise and diet are probably the most important things for concentration yeah its am for me here,1
him i dont want to say his possible bad moves he might be watching the stream also him casually says his master queen capture plans like he is alone,1
are you good at chess,1
not bad,2
life is like a game of chess changing with each move nikita k gope,1
chess is so easy to learn yet so hard to master,0
stalemate is a thing that rarely happens me in every game i play oh boy how wrong you are,0
the queens gambit was the first thing that came to my mind when i saw the title of the video but lets be honest i have to watch the video and play chest many times in order to learn but this was pretty helpful thank you,2
this was always on my checklist to learn to play chess,1
my friend is in the nationals of chess championships so he taught me chess but still this helped me a lot thanks,2
it makes me so happy to see chess getting popular,2
nice inspiring chess video for the learners thanks bright side,2
and he died at one year for every square on the board poetic,0
imagine if his sister bought a snakes and ladders boards instead,1
spasky was arguably even more impressive by being a grandmaster of kindness,2
i remember watching an interview with fischer and he mentioned how during matches even the wrong lighting would throw him off definitely seems like he might have had sensory issues that weren t well understood at the time,0
spasky was honestly the mvp of the story with giving into fischers demands to ensure he got a fair shot to prove his title even though he was being pressured to win at all costs by the soviet union just because he respected him plus even though fischer went off grid for like twenty years spasky was willing to go out of his way to play with him again then to try and personally protest for his release from prison and even ask to stay in his cell to play chess with him just because he respected his skill so much,1
my grandfather actually played with bobby regularly in at the west orange chess club in new jersey they played on the same team in interstate tournaments i found some of my grandpa s old letters and it s pretty cool he won multiple chess championships some amateur and some professional in the late s and early s he also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines he was born in and while i like to think he taught bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year it s likely the year old schooled my grandpa my grandpa quit chess in to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially chess tournaments didn t pay well back then though he probably played teenage bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future if a year old made a multitime champion quit the game entirely he must have been truly special my grandpa could card count so i don t think he had a problem switching to bridge and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career i never got to meet him because he died before i was born i m only i would ve loved to ask him about bobby maybe my mom knows a bit more all i have are letters and a few chess trophies it s very hard to collect information from the early s,2
he thought the us government was out to get him to be fair they did have a warrant out for his arrest i mean on that front he wasnt wrong,1
the light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person on the spectrum it is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them lashing out comes from difficulty communicating feeling different and knowing you are different it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess while playing he probably felt safe knowing the rules knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didnt understand or care about,0
this story should also be a story of boris spassky if the information is correct the guy is a really decent person spassky could repeat could be a world champ without competing but no when fischer had his ticks spassky said just give in and lets play many years later spassky told then uspresident bush to free spassky and even met fischer in prison to play chess boris spassky was obvisously one of a kind a human face of communism,1
my dad tried to teach me chess i was only he was i picked up the moves of the pieces easily halfway through our first game he said do you have a strategy or are you just making moves at random i said making moves at random he boxed up the pieces and that was that i later turned out to be a terrific poker player,2
our first merch drop is here,1
incredibly done,2
apart from the blindfold this is the nicest levy has ever been,2

i have never seen levi that wellbehaved,1
first of all as someone that has played chess for close to years on and off i am impressed with the results that michelle made in a short time chess is a game that you have to play for months at the very least to become good at it takes time to recognize patterns and then feel comfortable enough playing against someone else that has also been playing for a while you did great michelle,2
thank you so much for reaching out early in i am so thrilled we got to start this journey and everything it became congratulations on a spectacular episode cheers to us all hating chess together,2
hermosa elecci n datme kissxuno los mortales abian apreciado tan hermosa mujer hopi sweeter sun hotter joonie cooler yoongy butter son unos de los mejores conciertos ma as no se la las elecciones cinematogr ficas y art sticas son brillantes referencias culturales europeas realmente interesantes ojal la cultura europea se representara m s a menudo tan bellamente no puedo dejar de decir oh esto es hermoso a lo largo del video luz en serio el que se encargue de la iluminaci n genial aqxc,1
im officially addicted to rewatching this shit over and over i think michelle really put her finger on the main problem with chess because its so much tied to our perception of intelligence not being good enough makes you feel dumb and embarrassed rather than just treating it as another skill to learn once you get over this barrier in your head it becomes fun,0
anna and her its castlemania had me at the edge of my seat cheering lovely to have someone so supportive and excited for you in your corner,2
chess pog,1
dude imagine the creator was losing and he just said actually the queen could move wherever so,1
me learns en passant also me i think im ready to defeat magnus carlsen,1
there could be an infinite amount of games just in the first couple moves actual chess games e e nf nc bb nf both players agree to a draw,1
fun fact magnus carlsen has won ten games at the same time while blindfolded before however this pales in comparison to the world record games played blindfolded at the same time held by grandmaster timur gareyev,2
can we just appreciate how he edited the reflection of the board to appear on his glasses,1
forgot to mention british people are extremely good at chess cuz their queen is immortal,2
chess is one of those games where you can prove you re smarter in every way just by winning,2
me and this little horse have something common each time we move it results in an l can feel the heat of that burn from here,1
as someone who used to really be into chess i can indeed validate that everything said in this video is true,2
thanks james really informative for an older beginner like me im i always fail because the young players are so fast at assessing positions and adapting now i can have a system hopefully ill feel less disoriented,2
would love to see you playing a game live preferably a rapid game at mins time control and how you yourself use these aspects to analyse evaluate a positions as the game goes on i think that would be great viewing,2
dear friend id like to congratulate you on starting this kind of educational videos ive watched hundreds of your analysis theyre brilliant im sorry dont know your name itd be great if you please introduce yourself briefly in the next video thanks again and wishing you all the best,2
this is the type of stuff that will make you grow because a lot of people are casual non club players but love chess and are always willing to learn,2
material squares pawns initiative development space minor piece king safety got it excellent toolkit how could you define activity is activity an umbrella concept for initiative space development minor pieces very nice new format digging up old wisdom in chess books thanks a lot,2
im getting better but analyzing whos better but converting that advantage of pieces or space into a win is still a big challenge,2
enjoying the new direction my tattoo didn t need any more new prodigies,2
good stuff,2
good job,2
today i m going to europe when i come back i ll review all of this teachimg videos,1
thank you sir for your wonderful explanation,2
of the best by alekhine sir a match where alekhine with black exchanged queens in style sac of rooks for rebirth of his queen outstanding game,2
,1
very nice game sir bishop g is game changing move,2
best opening frome white i ever seen,2
thank you so much gor wonderfull game,2
nice vintage game sir thx,2
mikhail tal vs olafsson candidates please make a video on this game sir,1
alexander fricis,1
very nice game,2
i actually prefer the prerecorded events the cinematography and editing are wicked awesome,2
i d love to get the pro it d be a ni e upgrade from my but it s sooo expensive,2
the invites darker colors could be for the always on display,1
i havent had a new iphone for a few years im very hyped to see what has changed,2
moving over to ios from android in september looking at picking up the iphone pro max if i can get a great deal at a later date im looking at adding airpods pro or was going to stick with android but due to the samsung s ultra being shipped with the exynos chip and throttling back performance in the uk its led me to switching to an iphone,2
what about a new imac surely about time,1
planning on upgrading from a xr but having no usbc leaves a sour taste on my mouth,0
im really looking forward to getting the smaller inch iphone pro graphite gb,2
apple watch pro gonna my first apple watch wanted apple for a long time to take the watch to the extreme and finally its happening,2
maybe they will do the augmented reality glasses,1
dont ask me how i posted this hours before the official apple announcement i am not a wizard i do not own a time machine please disregard all rumors saying i own a time machine,0
wow weeks time is flying by fast great work as always greg hope to finally upgrade still wish for a pink color in the pros lol,2
love the content greg keep it up,2
have updated every year but not this year keeping the mini because it s the perfect size easy inout of pocket one handed for nearly every feature,2
finally the front facing camera moving to the horizontal position now if only they would carry this over to the pro models that s when i would buy one as i do zoom and teams calls and the current ipad setup is totally frustrating,0
this is crazy finally a new event oh yeah i hope for the ipad th gen and of course iphone i need to make a video about it on my channel too,2
i used to own a time machine well actually a time capsule but the drive in it failed i would love to see apple bring back a modern version of that device the pro watch is attractive i m still rocking a and forget about any new iphone until they have usbcthunderbolt,2
will wait one more year for the universal connectivity of usbc and the better battery life and speed of the nm processor,2
im buying iphone pro max and apple watch plus newest airpods pro been saving ages cheers dude wont the pro max come with out of the box though,2
thanks for the informative video i have an iphone pro and probably gonna stick with it for maybe years,2
lets go its satellite time baby,2
my day instantly gets better whenever sam uploads i cant wsit for this event i hope we get the satellite connectivity feature the new prices are terrifying,2
it seems way more likely to me that the invite is actually referring to astrophotography the iphone has improved a lot in the last few years at lowlight photography especially if youre using a tripod plus if theres going to be a mp camera sensor thatll be amazingly helpful for nighttime shots im about as confident about that as sam is about it being satellite connectivity,2
ill be upgrading to the iphone pro max after using an plus for five years so i imagine ill really feel that upgrade stoked,2
i seriously hope ian and luke is on the genius bar podcast this week,2
astrophotography can it finally take pictures of the moon like my dslr i love your channel nd podcast and cant wait for the pro max,2
i didn t know luke and ian were so chill like that,1
i m honestly waiting for the new ipad pro s to drop might make the m pros available for cheaper refurbished or otherwise heck it may make the ones even cheaper,2
seeing how things are lately coming out with apple ive been very excited to see what comes out great coverage and updates as always sam lol luke just so casual in the background,2
i so hope they drop the airpods pro at this event that s all i m interested in at the minute,2
you don t know how happy i am to see you back john keep doing what you do,2
dont scare us like that jon im glad youre back in front of the camera,2
order of event prediction intro what apple has achieved so far this year eco stuff privacy etc apple tv showsmovies and more apple music songs announcement iphone s iphone pros ipad th gen apple watch series apple watch pro software release with exact date for ios and a rough date for ipados and macos,2
my guess for the order of the event new tv shows update to the budget ipad apple watch s iphone regular iphone pro,1
heres my prediction for the products being launched some new subscription service probably related to apple tv airpods pro apple watch regular se then pro probably with some new fitness related service as well iphone series regular then pros,2
i missed fpt welcome back jon,2
heres my current prediction for this event intro what apple had achieved this year compared to other years new apple tv plus subscription service updated ipad airpod pros apple watch regular se then pro probably with a new fitness service iphone series regular then pros,2
here are my predictions something small related to their services probably something related to apple tv watches sethen regular after that pro iphones regulars then pros,1
my prediction for that event will be they will start off with the the new software and the new chip then move on to the apple watches and after they last thing will be all about the iphone and of course the iphone pro and pro max with all the new functions well that s my predictions hope to with that iphone but still best of luck to every one,2
good to see you back john my prediction new subscription service new software update ios then ipados airpods pros apple watch then ruggedpro edition iphone regular then pros,2
whos excited for september th,2
when it comes to apple the key to the hints they give is not to overthink it and i m pretty sure this is related to the newer bigger camera that s gonna be on the phones that will take beautiful pictures of the night sky if there s one thing i ve learned about apple in the past years is that they aren t that deep,2
it s going to be sooo awesome this year and i can t wait for all the fun we re gonna have in the livestream i really hope the iphone pro s coming purple it s my first time not wanting to buy the space gray,2
it s be great if they gave us the feature to watch a video in one screen while watching on a live show to start in another screen top and bottom also the ability to add covers to the multi app clusters to make the screen look cleaner the ability to to swipe conversations to the side like picture in picture while doin other things instead of having to go back and forth between apps,2
im excited to see what apple announces at the event im really hoping for a camera with more than megapixels i think it would be a game changer for sure especially for photographers like me all in all im excited for the event,2
i am very excited i do believe it is focused on iphone and apple watch along with maybe some new airpod pro models the ipad release along with a new mac pro computer will come in october it will be strange getting ios watchos and tvos updates but no ipad out west on the same day it is called confusion apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen i d like apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame hopefully i was and watchos along with tvos will be released on monday september which is a scheduled day off for me from work i do not like getting updates while i am at work because it will take time to install them i did watch youtube video from a different channel and i replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iphone would not be compatible with ios in do you think this is true if so should my parents who have iphone models should upgrade this year or wait until before i was comes out out i did tell them about the iphone se thirdgeneration because neither one seems interested in upgrading to my iphone or getting one with face id themselves,2
seems odd to create ar creative around satellite tech since it s just for emergencies but also agree doesn t seem like cameras will get tech for astro photography as you d think other issues with phone photography need to be addressed before trying to shoot stars in any case glad they put out the invites a week earlier than usual i ll be able to plan for get readypreorderapu if all models are ontime,1
i usually switch back and forth yearly between apple and android as i like both fanboy of neither but apple is hitting a peak and really not innovating much anymore i m just going to switch from the pro max to the s ultra as i said i love both but i m not seeing any reasons to upgrade with apple this year if the is a game changer it will be right up my yearly cycle routine switch between both,2
thank you so much brandoni love your entertaining and informative videosi really appreciate your efforts and dedicationyou are so awesome and amazingi can t wait for the iphone s and ios keep up your great efforts brandon,2
here s an what if apple made an iphone mini starting around with three cameras no notch but have it the size of the current mini small but super powerful and i know a bunch of people would buy it cmon mini gang where yall at,2
homepod airpods pro apple watch pro apple watch series apple watch se iphone lineup iphone pro lineup ios watchos official release,1
the thing i am most interested in is seeing how apple will sell the with a straight face,2
airpods without stems would loose their character,0
thing to expect apple will punk the leakers for the third event in a row,1
i truly appreciate your videos because of you i ve kept my xsmax and my apple watch i don t see the need to upgrade until next year if apple go to the usbc,2
good news with keeping the stem i always wondered how they could pull a stem removal off without killing usability i mean how the hell should you press a button when this thing is turning and then buttons are on the inside,0
iphone will be the most amazing incredible outrageous thing anyone has seen anywhere in all of time and even beyond time it will run ios come in many colors take great photos and videos will be able to charge on a little black plate on a table extreme perfect infinite edit whenever and always multitask exquisitely play very special music and movies and like the last generations will be enable you to multi task at lightning speed but perhaps a little faster but you will not be able to notice since the last one was so fast it will be pure magic,2
i am ready for september hopefully ios and watchos now will come out on monday the th that would be a good release date i find it funny that ipados will be delayed a month that is very strange it seems like apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like ipados or,2
was really hoping the airpods would have some sort of hearing losshearing aid abilities there is a stigma and pricing on real hearing aids whereas most headphones phone combos have far more processing and programming abilities to the nerfed offerings from hearing aid manufacturers it would be a massive market to tap into and takeover for whichever phone maker does it first,1
on the beta ios there is a battery indicator feature in battery settings it is automatically set so default to only show in low power mode instead of the bar decreasing it will always show you your battery,2
tolles video schade das sie die notch nicht lassen bis sie komplett unter dem display verschwindet ist doch eigentlich das erkennungszeichen vom iphone ich glaube das sie das iphone mini alle paar jahre wieder aktualisiert bringen werden da ich erst letztes jahr beim pro max zugeschlagen habe wird es dieses jahr wohl ein update von meinem er ipad pro werden mal schauen was im oktober kommt gru an alle,1
mein standpunkt jedes produkt ohne usbc wird nicht gekauft beispielsweise h tte ich gerne kopfh rer die airpods pro sollen es werden das geld liegt bereit durch den lightninganschluss w ren sie schon vor dem kauf veraltet und ein fehlkauf das gleiche gilt auch f r die iphones das ende anderer anschl sse ist durch die eu eingeleitet und steht fest,1
das highlight wenn es denn berhaupt kommt d rfte die apple watch pro werden vor allem beim preis oder die normale apple watch im kantigen design das neue iphone ob nun gro oder klein wirkt f r mich pers nlich recht unspektakul r recycling iphone pro aus dem vorjahr gleiches gilt f r die iphone promodelle ob nun pille oder notch selbst wenn die kamera jetzt noch unbelievable w re w rde mir das keine euro aus der geldb rse locken ich denke es wird auch das letzte iphone mit einem achip berhaupt sein n chstes jahr wird auch das iphone auf den mchip umgestellt meiner meinung nach l ngst berf llig ich rechne noch fest mit neuen airpods oder airpods pro interessant d rfte sein was mit dem apple tv passiert auch mit der berarbeitung des homepod mini rechne ich fest von einem neuen alten homepod gehe ich derzeit nicht aus mich pers nlich interessiert nur die neue watch da bei meine er langsam der akku schlapp macht und apple n chstes jahr bei dem er modell den softwarehahn endg ltig zudrehen wird das wird vielen so gehen da viele noch das er modell haben und schon seit einem jahr auf das kantige design warten aber eins steht f r mich auch ganz klar fest kein kantiges design keine neue apple watch dann muss die er bei mir noch ein jahr irgendwie weiter berleben,1
vielleicht bekommt ja der lightning anschluss der iphones ein speed update auf usb x das hatten sie auch im letzten ipad pro verbaut allerdings damals ein langsamer usb chip der nur rund die doppelte usb geschwindigkeit konnte also technisch w re es ja machbar wenn sie wollten dann w ren auch die gro en videos schneller am pcmac,1
die apple watch wird vermutlich meine erste apple watch werden bin mal gespannt,1
ich freue mich nat rlich auf den event und bin wie immer gespannt was ich aber mit meinem iphone mache wei ich noch nicht ich bin mit dem er noch immer vollkommen zufrieden und habe ber die vielen vorangegangenen versionen und k ufe gelernt dass ich eigentlich mit dem neuen iphone meist genau dasselbe mache wie mit dem vorherigen eigentlich sollte ich das pro erst ersetzen wenn es entweder kaputt geht oder der akku am ende seines lebens ist beides trifft nicht zu vermutlich staune ich ber das neue iphone und vielleicht bin ich neidisch auf sch ne neue farben aber dann nehme ich meins aus der h lle und stelle fest dass mein oceam blue auch nicht so bel ist zusammengefasst versp re ich keinen wunsch oder gar drang ein neues iphone anzuschaffen und bin mit meinem happy vermutlich berspringe ich das er auch noch um dann beim er zuzuschlagen,1
ich werde bestimmt nicht dabei sein und ich h tte auch berhaupt nichts dagegen wenn apple nur alle jahre oder so mal ein neues modell herausbringt wer braucht alle diese marginalen verbesserungen mein altes se ist immer noch ein sehr gutes telefon verwaltet termine und nachrichten prima und unterst tzt die organisation meines business ganz hervorragend,1
ich bin noch unentschlossen entweder das iphone max oder das pro max werde die keynote abwarten,1
moin micha dieses mal hat wohl der feiertag am montag ein event am dienstag verhindert mal schauen ob eine neue applewatch vorgestellt wird die meine series ersetzen k nnte das iphone interessiert mich in diesem jahr berhaupt nicht wenn dann w rde ich nur ein iphone mini in erw gung ziehen ob es eines geben wird man wei es nicht lassen wir uns durch die eklige ger chtek che nicht in die irre f hren denn was ich berhaupt nicht ab kann ist wenn sich selbst ernannte experten dar ber aufregen dass sich appleger te versp ten die berhaupt nicht nicht angek ndigt wurden lg claus,1
mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische innere der iphones beim macbook air m hat apple beim kleinsten speicher lediglich einen einzelnen baustein verbaut und die ger te sind deshalb angeblich langsam falls diese technik auch bei den iphones verbaut wird bin ich schon gespannt was drinnen ist und zum iphone mini ich k nnte mir vorstellen dass dieses ger t in naher zukunft als iphone se oder se zur ckkommt,2

it must be a serious issue for apple to admit it is a security thing usually the label their security updates as bug fixes,1
software has exploits all the time apple just usually doesnt announce it does this mean apple fans are going to stop talking about how the iphone has never had a single bug or a single security exploit in its entire history no,1
you know what is sad when you cant trust to even update your phone cause how bad the corruption is,0
this presents a problem notice this mysterious hacker would try to target everyday people instead of the powers that be,0
these issues are not growing pains its risky business,0
that s why we all know if you update your phone when the new phones are about to come out it kills your battery messes with your old one so you were forced to buy a new one,0
this happens regularly that they release patches,1
i hate how these companies need to innovate for us always creates problems and bloated operating systems for us microsoft is worse,0
i remember a time when people with apple devices would brag because they said they could not get a virus,1
my iphone auto updated last night and when i looked at my notifications this morning i had a notification telling me there has been an apple data leak and they recommend changing all my current passwords now this smh,0

fort,2
which apple product are you most excited about in september this is the best iphone accessory in links to the best iphone accessory deals on amazon airpods pro on sale airpods sale,2
i know i m in the minority but i love my mini will be keeping that until it can t go anymore or some huge leap in tech comes also got a titanium apple watch at launch and will be keeping that until we get a huge leap in battery tech,2
i have an iphone pro that im completely happy with im still impressed by the cameras on it beautiful pictures and video is there any compelling reason for me to upgrade to the otherwise ill wait until the with usbc,2
ill upgrade when they finally put usbc on next years iphone,2
i feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part i feel a redesigned little bit bigger mini would do really well i also see no reason for anyone to upgrade i upgraded from a mini to a regular when i switched carriers i can personally say the phones are nearly identical in every way if thats any indication of what to expect from the line i would say if you have an pro any or model theres not much of a reason to upgrade ios isnt a design overhaul anything ill be keeping my iphone for a long time the watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb if you can find a series or buy it especially when you can get a series for around brand or refurbished from apple instead of getting the new se which is essentially a series i think upgrading the watch or iphone this year is already a skip the product to be most excited for is the th gen ipad getting way better features i will def be upgrading my mini to and ipad th gen especially since it ll have usbc i wish they would do the same with the iphone airpods apple pencil i cant wait for the october event i think if you have an apple watch se you dont need to upgrade your watch either,1
whoevers reading this i pray that whatever youre going through gets better and whatever youre struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day amen,2
apple is making a big mistake by giving the apple watch pro all the nice features we ve been waiting for a redesign for the apple watch for awhile but apple will just have to deal with the consequences and watch as all this pro watches sit on shelves and collect dust just like the original homepod,0
hearing about the pro models getting more expensive and the regular ones being barely an upgrade i just hope the mini will get the usual price drop,1
they should also have a mid tier mac mini like in between the mac studio and m mac mini it should have a m pro and m max as options,1
thanks for all the updates and i m looking forward to the event,2
get ready guys,2
its high time apple puts the periscope lens on its pro iphone lineup x zoom is not at all drool worthy,1
this hint could also be about always on display feature,1
now thats a good newssuper excited for this,2
waiting for big billions day sale,2
love u bro u say all the information at right time waiting for iphone launch,2
according to new leaks prices will be same as line up for no dollars is raised,1
thanks for all the information sir eagerly waiting for the new iphones and and your videos on them,2
can t wait for ios,2
apple going to surprise in camera zoom or a full day battery according to far out,2
my main problem with the m air is that it sits between the m air and the macbook pro those are two of the best laptops ever made if you can find the m air on sale then it is still an outstanding value if you are paying to upgrade the ssd and ram then the m air is so close in price to the macbook pro that if you can spend the little bit extra you will not regret doing so,2
been using my m mba for weeks now the best decision i ever made totally loving the starlight its fast very light and the battery is definitely powerful i only gotta charge it after days of heavy usage at work,2
this should be an interesting video i m also going to be very curious how this machine fares against upcoming mbp m models,2
i love it to have the options for the slower flash storage and ram with more capacities i am ready to live with the consequences of slow swap files but if the macbook has enough ram swapping things shouldnt be the issue,2
ended up buying the m with upgraded memory and student discount costed me around it is a fantastic machinem not worth it imo as a college student when m can do all the tasks i want effortlessly,2
one of the best reviews ive seen for the m air very grounded and realistic the base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier but an upgraded m would be a delightful machine to work on for several years,2
it would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel model had where you can change the refresh rate up to hz not great but i would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you re viewing movies it sucks that apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the thunderbolt or soc i feel that the argument that many people don t use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place my sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers the thing that tempts me the most about the air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs it s more or less wellrounded however if i m bumping up the storage and unified memory i wouldn t be that far off from the m pro macbook pro price strangely the would be lighter than my current and very outdated nonretina macbook pro the only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty that s losing it s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to i m hanging onto it as my backup computer really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop the smudging thing is annoying from what i see it s an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that i ve yet to experience at work i work with desktop towers and i m used to the noise i suppose,0
thanks for helping me justify that i should get the mbp instead of the m mba,2
as a student looking for a portable workspace this is perfect for me i already have a supped up gaming pc so yeah shame about the lack of dual display really was a bit of a bummer i went for gb in silver cant wait d,2
glad i went with the m mba last year instead of waiting i like the look better than the wedge but honestly the m is the best laptop ive ever had if i could do one thing different id upgrade the ram but i still dont think im gonna push it too hard,2
guys we were right they removed the box too,1
i m kinda glad the iphone is still the same as and gives me a reason to keep my money and my iphone pro max,2
i m usually at least somewhat excited in my anticipation of the redesigned iphone models but to be honest the pacific blue of pro max has me very content and it will take another completely revolutionary designsoftware leap for me to leave this device pacific blue is just too pretty to let go of,2
thanks for the inside look into the iphone pro max i kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the pro max hope apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging no point in adding a bigger battery if they won t unleash all the capabilities,2
that pretty much solves my problem gonna buy the latest pro the green color is gorgeous,2
i love how lou was literally more excited about the caliper than the phone humorous,2
i work with mitutoyo calipers every day its supposedly more accurate if you measure towards the inside of the jaws due to the outside being more susceptible to bend due of lever forces or whatever its called but likely doesnt matter if not measuring to micron mm levels,1
i m planning on getting the pro max cuz my xr has run its course i assumed the wouldn t be any different and i was right but the only thing that would kinda make me want to get it is the supposed new orange color orange is my favorite color,2
mm larger lenses on iphone will be a huge difference on such small optics that will render much faster speeds and maybe even make room for bigger image sensors or better stabilisation,2
i think apple needs to rethink their pricing i m a huge apple fan but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous,0
i m very excited for the future of apple but as you said the downside is that there are too many products and if apple doesn t start to focus on their lineup they will just become another tech company lacking what makes apple products so iconic and better,2
i wish apple tried something new that samsung did with the galaxy series and that was creating an active rugged phone from the ground up no need for a case it was a phone that was built to withstand drops and not get dinged up or have glass chipped it offered great grips on the side and i think apple could really hit a good target audience with something like that,2
the biggest change apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues that means no longer lying to their customers not abusing them not wallet rping them for profit not gaslighting them being honest about how private apple products really are not using decieving marketing etc that way they might start to get back some of their credibility back at this stage they have a huge problem on their hands as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around,0
i am very excited to see what happens now that johnny has moved on to something else it took some getting used to but i really like watchos along with ios and ipados sometimes i think apple keeps a certain product like the iphone x or apple watch series supported way too long one thing that forces you to get a new apple watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning that has happened to me twice i have the same apple tv that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued i have not had any issues with it so i have no reason to complain except i do believe they need a new high definition apple tv my tv does not support k when apple stops supporting this particular tv model i will definitely upgrade although my new tv has appletv built into the app store i cannot find the espn or mlb applications and i have not found a visio app store,2
the apple we have now is much larger than the apple steve inherited after they nearly died i don t think they have too many products but i agree about them dragging along some models like the watch and tv hd apple s current path is bringing new customers to the mac that would have stayed on windows simple functionality can mean having the ports a laptop needs and great battery life,2
apple need to come stronger this year with the new design and advanced iphone line up,2
i love my apple phone i just wish that it was more customizable also a big issue i have with apple is they make you pay for storage i think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it it s ridiculous i refused to pay for memory from them i would pay google first,0
hey robert ive used apple products since the s owned since the s i love apple products but they have left me in a position i never thought id be in with them my late imac is one of the models to get cut off from macos thats not a big deal what bothers me more is there is no imac with apple silicon its been the perfect combination of space saving and nice big beautiful display there current line up is just something im not sure what i want mac mini or mac studio apple pro display may end up costing more than the imac did to get something equivalent i have two years left of security updates for monterey which is good id rather have an older computer that runs well and meets my needs than buy something new that i wouldnt enjoy using on that note my appletv s and iphone will get the next updates so will be able to look forward to that,2
i am very excited to see what is coming next for apple i just bought the new macbook air m chip and am in love with the sleek thin design with the biggest and brightest screen that apple has ever had,2
i updated mine too so tired of lazy wicked human beings that enjoy taking advantage of everyone specially the elderly so many scammers and hackers from foreign and domestic,0
pretty much of all apple devices now are vulnerable,0
funny how theres a new hack discovered everytime apple is within days of revealing a new phone huh,2
nothing new this had been the case for so man years we have seen many time when microsoft os was targeted and now its apple os you cant never achieve but you can improve for sure,2
yikes going to the core,0
dude that s what the flashes of my phone were screen shots,1
uh this is the opposite from what they use to say,0
should be automatic updates just like android phones,1
another elon musk joke,1
im samsung safe not interested in apple or facebook good luck,1
i still never forget this song even its been years already i somehow randomly remember this song thats why im here,2
i feel like it should be anyone s goal in life to reach even of the selfconfidence and happiness this man emanates,2
and still better than of edm music scene,2
we should never let this masterpiece die,0
i work in japan frequently and for the last few years when people ask me what it s like over there i just show them this video haha seriously i love japan and it really is home to of the world s craziest shit,2
anybody who randomly remembered and came here to watch this,1
me haven t heard this song for over five years my brain today hey remember this song,1
this man is the most underrated artist of our times a classic like this never gets old,2
no way this is only years old it felt like something that deserved to be in the deep recesses of youtube,2
absolutely one of the best and hilarious songs ever,2
cant wait for not just because it will be apples biggest year in terms of product launches but mostly because it is the year that has the potential to completely redefine the tech industry let me know which product youre looking forward to the most,2
there will always be something better in the future and that doesn t mean we shouldn t buy today s product and be happy with them you will come next year and say wait till there will be something better,2
guys but i reckon might be a better year to buy the iphone,2
i think the is a meaningful upgrade just because its getting rid of the notch after years,2
im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned theyre gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely maybe with the standard iphone models theyll put usb c only because theyre forced to at that point and the pros will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port,2
jesus christ can we wait until the actually comes out,0
too many rumors and with the recession coming i think its a wrong time to put stock in future guarantee apple and other big companies just dropped a big number of employees and its going to get worse if the recession is really coming,0
now we just realize that mac pro was beyond its time with the apple silicon we know that design would be quite viable today related to those temperature issues i guess,2
i ve been waiting for an upgrade for inch macbook i love the inch it s so thin and light i carried it in my bag everywhere and i don t feel it i tried the inch air and i felt the dent on my shoulder,2
most excited for the mixed reality headsets would love a video detailing that,2
are you ready for the september event,1
i am actually really excited for the event and seeing how they will word the new base though i have to wake up at in my area but anyway still happy about it,2
i have a question regarding price drops the video mentions the iphone and does the price drop only apply to the normal models or to the entire pro and pro max lineup if so will you only get these models for the reduced price from apple or also from other retailers for example amazon,1
i can t believe we re just a month away from the iphone series being unveiled im so excited,2
i agree that the i cut out looks pretty good much better than a normal hole punch but i have to disagree with more screen because the usable screen will be the same as the base models if not slightly less,2
i have a series and i refuse to upgrade until apple integrates magsafe charging it s absolutely ridiculous that i need different chargers for my iphone macbook and watch,0
i really think there should always be an iphone mini option for people who like smaller phones or want to pay less for their device,2
i love the look of the two pro models and although i have a galaxy s ultra i will be getting one of the pro model iphone s i m just not sure which one for sure yet i m leaning towards the pro max tb,2
i already know there s going to be another video exactly like this that you upload next week and every week until the actual event and the day of the event we ll get another video right before the event to tell us something major that leaked and then you ll be here again right after the event to tell us what the event told us life cycle energy,1
the regular models dont have the i because theyre most likely just rebranded iphone and pros left over the pro and promax will have the next gen chip while the reg and reg max will be the equivalent to the and promax,1
make sure you add a payment type so you can give more money to apple that makes getting important updates a lot easier its all part of that apple user experience then you dont have to look at anything youll just see a frontfacing update that doesnt take a back seat to apple greed,2
apple needs to be held accountable fix this,0
thank you for this vague warning and advice at least inform the public of what systemios version we should have on our particular devices,1
wow im surprised i figured apples answer to their failure was to buy the new iphone that magically isnt effected by this hack discovered just before the new iphone reveal,0
great reporting when they don t mention the version of ios that is the fix i m guessing it s or is it i guess i ll watch a different news report to find out before reporter s get jobs don t they have to go to journalism skools,1
great way to get people to update their devices,2
he s wrong you don t need a full battery just at least,0
august is the worst month for retail theyre trying anything to get you to spend,0
if updates only fixed security flaws then updates would be a good thing with no downside consequences but thats rarely if ever the case updates can change the appearance features and smooth operation of applications and even slow down your phone,1
my macbook pro literally died last night so id say im safe,0
we can always count on justine about the iphone im so looking forward for the iphone if this were to be true about the purple iphone im going to have to check it out thanks justine for this video you will always be one of my favorite youtubers,2
i love justines point about the iphone mini i hope apple continues to manufacture it,2
when i have a rough day your videos always make me so happy with all your positivity thank you,2
great video was looking forward to upgrading my iphone for a but the more i hear the more im inclined to getting a refurbished as the prices are supposed to be insane this year and the updates incremental at best,2
even though im not updating my phone this year it s always cool to see what s coming and what s new so im excited to see ios,2
so excited for iphone season i will be watching justine for all the latest updates,2
i ve just recently started watching your channel and it s amazing i love how straight forward and honest your videos are i think i m most excited for the pro max and seeing the notch go away,2
got the pro max around the time it released last year and i ve been so pleased with the performancebattery life that i actually think i ll wait to upgrade until the next gen,2
just bought my iphone gb blue version way back in march and i think im gonna keep this iphone in the next years depending on the review of tech reviews comparison between the iphone vs iphone,2
those slick apple product videos havent been the same without jony saying alyoumineeum,1
i wholeheartedly recommend that you read the new book after steve the audiobook is great too it discusses the dynamic between jony tim and steve and jony s frustrations after steve passed i think you d enjoy it,2
while i like the clean lines of squareboxy design however every time i hold my old iphone pro i actually really miss those curved edges its wayyy more comfortable to hold than my pro,2
i think the end of the endless pursuit for thinness and design ie form over function represents the lifting of a burden on apples legendary branding apples prioritization on performance and functionality is going to be a great thing to see,2
i normally never comment but i can t help on commenting on this video this video is incredibly well done it is so different to the usual tech videos also it is really well researched thank you for your work sara,2
its strange i was literally thinking about this just the other day and how many people actively avoid getting a macbook between on the used market so glad theyve gone back to functionality i just hope they can sort their oh so strange pricing points an upgraded air m costs almost the same as the m pro like what,1
in my opinion the greatness of apples design language came from the combination of ive and jobs they kind of needed each other as sparring partners the post jobs era lacked a lot of innovative design ideas,2
had to double back and say i thoroughly appreciate these kinds of videos im glad apple is not longer making products thinner for the sake of being thinner risking thermal head room and bater capacity yea its nice to have a thin product but not at the sake of performance considering the price,2
was arguably apple s not worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software for example ios was pure trash control center for ios was hit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into with the redesigned macbook flat edge iphone apple silicone etc apple is doing much better software is much better too not to mention apple is bringing back colors to their products no more space gray gold and silver we have blue iphones red green purple sierra blue midnight green pink so many beautiful colors red apple watch blue apple watch blue airpods max pink and green apple is so much arguably better now ive was good for his time but onward we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better,2
as a long time apple fan your video was spot on and fair all those apple products you thought were awful really were awful i share your optimism for a new apple era where we get a better balance between performance function sizeweight and design,2
i love the fact that they are creating the max version in pro and non pro i feel like it s tough to find the pro max models in recent years in the color and storage size if you don t preorder on launch day there s probably a large market of people who just want the large screen but are not as focused on all the extra features so i m wondering if that s apples reasoning for it,2
love the pro max for photo and video im hoping ios will bring improvements in processing better skin tones generally,2
hoping to upgrade my iphone to an iphone mini once these come out apparently i m one of the few users that prefers the small phone,2
i love how apple is now just always playing catch up with samsung samsung first had like or models of each flagship phone whereas apple just had the small one and the big one now they have different models samsung decided to go with a hole punch in the screen for the selfie camera and apple decided to screw everyone with that ugly cutout at the top now theyre going with a hole punch,1
why am i always let down by these releases apple and basically all companies now are really bending us all over and going raw,0
still very disappointing that the mini has been deleted from the roster there are still many users who prefer the smaller phone maybe in the future apple will once again offer the smaller phone,1
i have the pro max and literally only getting the ip pro model because i m tired of the max size so really nothing on the pro model that wows me but really at this point in yearly iphones we are past the wow must have moments so this pro model will be the first iphone that i will keep for years and not upgrade until it breaks and have to get new phone,1
the rumour about titanium coming to the iphone pro models was a old rumour the latest rumours don t mention titanium at all,1
it looks like they might be simplifying their phone line by differentiating the regular and pro lines iphone max effectively last years phones same design cpu screen will become budget phones at replacing all the different old models se xr they keep around to sell as budget phones iphone pro pro max will be the actual flagship phones at otherwise it does not make sense for apple to downgrade the regular iphone so much which is a good thing because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models sizes now theyll just have regular effectively last years models and pro the flagship models they should simplify the ipad line as well,2
what apple product are you most excited to see in september,2
this is the first year i m getting a pro max version so i m pumped for that but i m also very intrigued by an apple watch pro i ve always had an apple watch and i want to see what a pro model has to offer,2
hugely excited for the new redesigned apple watch i had high hopes last year however i was a bit disappointed when we didnt get a fresh new design hopefully all the rumours are true for this year and if so ill definitely be picking up the new apple watch,2
i m getting the ipad pro next week this year i really got into the apple ecosystem after using android and windows my whole life super happy about making the move and i can t wait to see what this event brings us including with os updates,2
i might be tempted with a watch upgrade however i m waiting for the mixed reality headset reveal and saving my money for the predicted steep price knowing apple they will tempt us with new features only available in their newest phone macs and watches compatible with the headset very exciting and very pricey,2
i am excited to see just how they change the budget ipad and how the screen will look and what the new watch will look like september cant come soon enough great video like always,2
im interested in buying the apple watch pro it would be my first apple watch and hopefully the battery life on the pro is significantly improved from the regular model,2
i m excited for an apple watch redesign myself currently still rocking my apple watch series but likely due for an upgrade sooner than later otherwise all i m really missing from my apple setup at the moment is a macbook,2
i really love the iphone pro max models i m sure that apple know what they are doing,2
i will definitely be upgrading to a pro max from my pro i ve had every iphone from the gs and up and also three iterations of the apple watch apple watch series will also be in the edc as well,2
thank you for a well done video i am certainly anxiously awaiting the model both for the added functions and most of all improved battery life a pro model at mm in my view is just too large,2
id like to see them implement a wider bluetooth range for the watch to phone connectivity and also a wider range for cellular the reception of booth have stayed the same other the different series thats what i want most they can keep the same look just needs better utilization,2
my personal opinion great product great design great features but it doesn t have the wow factor that ekg had i wish it had another hardware upgrade other than core temperature for me to be convinced to buy it this year perhaps if they added something with mental health more connectivity with your home wallet or something perhaps,2
i am excited i m anxious to see what apple officials have to say in september honestly i really like the apple watch se model i really don t see any use for all of those fancy sensors that apple talks about i m not sure how reliable they are next time i go to my primary care physician i will definitely ask her what she thinks of the apple watch i m not sure if she s even noticed it when i have gone to her before,2
i d get the pro all day long a bigger display would be amazing,2
awesome im waiting for the pro version mm and hoping for longer battery life battery life was why i sold my series after a few months coming off a day fitbit it just didnt offer enough value to me with the need to always charge during the day,2
my biggest problem so far with my has been that the sensors don t read over the tattoo on my left wrist so i have to wear it on my right on my left wrist quite a few features don t work if they fix this in i will by the biggest best model that they have,0
love apple i am looking forward to seeing the new especially the larger model,2
i just got the series two weeks ago so passing on the interesting idea on body temperature if they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose a feature to weigh you and blood pressure you may never need your doctor not sure if i would want a larger watch i have the mm series and that looks normal on my wrist since i have small hands and wrist anything bigger and i might as well strap a tablet to my wrist there always are trends to make devices bigger then when that s bulky smaller returns i would just like longed battery life,1
the only thing interesting for me would be the possibility for international roaming actually i cannot have it on the but it seems that it is possible with samsung watches how come,2
nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos,2
another cool thing missed in the review is how you can have the album cover of the track that is currently playing replace the wallpaper on the lock screen just tap the mini album cover,1
so much to look forward to here i m especially excited about the webcam topdown option and the live objects but everything else you shared with us here sounds just as amazing,2
i love customization in lockscreen and that alone makes ios a little better than previous versions and to know that it cannot cover my precious wallpaper which i mostly edit myself is a good addition dragging those photos in messages is really cool and satisfying,2
these are the first set of updates i have ever looked forward to so much and all equally so your vids never disappoint thank you love the live objects and desk cam continuity,2
this is one of the most interesting ios updates in a while actually kinda looking forward for this one,2
the only thing exiting about ios for me was sharing your screen over facetime i used that a whole lot but this ios update brings so much to the table and the lock screen customization has been something i m suprised didn t get added earlier,2
as an iphone user im always sceptical about updates because we all know that at least of the features announced are basically what android had for at least years but smart object and transposing the iphone camera to get topdown shots those are game changers apple has gone a long way in terms of ai and i dont think anyone is catching up with this soon enough my only complaint with the apple is battery life if you use every useful feature apple ecosystem provides you watchpodsmaciphone youre not seeing the end of the day without needing a recharge once they fix it my microscobic urge to return back to android will be gone forever i dont need a foldable screen i need battery apple has the rest of it,1
the most stable beta i ve ever done on an apple product think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever my biggest complaint is the ui for a lot of logins in safari not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn t fit right i m sure there is some kind of setting i can tweak but love the weather lock screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean the layout of settings is a lot better also even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything but it is much more intuitively than previous improvements,2
love it animations everything kudos for you and your team for making such amazing content,2
are you gonna wait for these redesigned ipads later this fall comment below if youre gonna buy any ipad right now it should be this one like our wallpapers download them here links to the new ipad on amazon new ipad air m ipad pro sale budget ipad ipad mini,1
thanks dude your leak theories are very practical,2
i think they keep home button models because kids and older people actually like it better its so much more simple to do a button press than remember swipe gestures,2
i actually started using an ipad for the first time exactly one year ago and yep i finally get it it is the go to device for consuming content,2
oh my god apple is finally increasing the price of the base ipad and keeping the large bezels on the top and bottom to make sure it is ugly and everyone knows you couldnt afford the ipad air this is absolutely amazing max tech,2
keeping the bezels and home button on the base ipad is a bit of a dick move by apple but predictable i was hoping it would just get the current ipad air design and that the ipad air got closer to the pro with the full rather than the at this point they should just rename it ipad se keeping this in mind the next iphone se may even get the body from the iphone mini a single camera at the back but keep the bezels and home button oh no,1
i just bought an m ipad pro because i didn t think the new features of the would be worth it for me especially since waiting for m would force me to give up the student discount which was a big deal i know everyone wants the magsafe charging or wireless charging but i actually dislike wireless charging so that s unimportant to me and the performance gains of the m don t matter since it s an ipad it s already crazy fast rumors i ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the m ipad pro because i use my ipad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode a notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side annoying i m very happy with my m and honestly all the m leaks make me even more relieved i m not waiting for it it s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like,0
honestly the homebutton isn t that bad considering every ipad other than the pro still uses touchid so the button on the front could be more practical than the power button on the top like air and the mini have,2
the base ipad is the perfect tool for studying its literally all i need to complement my mbp cant remember the last time i ever used a headphone jack in any device but why oh why does the ipad need a camera bump plz apple just a solid flat tablet is all we need i will never use the camera in a base ipad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design,0
i was looking forward to the new base ipad but a new design with a home button feels like a really odd decision considering it ll be sticking around for many years to come might look for a pro or air instead now,1
man really appreciate the comments and support around this video i sat on this story for so long it feels great to get it out one thing i ask is dont evaluate any other content creators through the lens of this story everyone has their own experiences these are just mine,2
pretty bananas but entirely unsurprising i ve heard from multiple friends about my blacklisted status without ever having spoken to anyone at apple ever,1
did you get another phone call after this video went live,1
now you know why ijustine always gets stuff because she just smiles and tells you how great the device is,2
we appreciate the transparency and honesty it s very unfortunate when these companies think they have more control than they actually do,0
yep this is exactly how apple picks winners and losers those they hand pick get early devices lots of traffic and the corresponding revenue along with great seorecommendation positions for future placements theres tremendous value in access to them and apple knows it most of this goes undisclosed by those whom apple picks for review units and access,2
ive never understood why apple does this they send earlyaccess devices to handpicked channels that almost always give positive reviews but just hours later the products are released to the public anyway and the blacklisted channels upload teardown videos or showcase major issuesnegative things etc i really wish apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want from a consumers point of view i dont trust reviews from those who get the early access products they clearly fit into apples agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place anyway sucks that this happened to you i remember watching apple content on this channel way back in the early s although as you said in the video its likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about apple now,0
you know you are fair an unbiased when a company throws a tantrum because you were being honest,1
im not really surprised at how you were treated apple likes to control the narrative always has im glad you shared this story makes you more trustworthy in my opinion,2
i bet apple will be calling you about this video now too keep up the good content and dont let these companies bully you into doing what they want that is why we love you,2
i worked with apple as a tech advisor focusing on softwarerelated issues and general usage in asiapacificmainly australia and new zealand customers apple has bounty for anyone that may crack and report vulnerability if theres issues like this we can submit a report and escalate it to senior engineers that make some time to resolve or find solution,2
funny how apple hasn t alerted me via their internal system yet and that i had to randomly come across this alert i am so over huge updates for apps i never use but cannot delete and the data being used in the background for uninstalled apps but it is likely i was hacked two or so weeks ago i couldn t find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening i have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have nothing like the convenient features of android phones methinks i am done being a slave to their gaslighting,0
this guy lowkey said you are not vulnerable to this attack and shouldnt need to worry about because you are useless,0
i would be more worried that most apps today are collecting crazy amounts of personal data and nobody is allowed to talk about that,0
apples major security flaws happened so many times on the other hand android seems to have none in this past few months does this mean android security is much stable than ios,1
glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers,2
glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers,2
apple has questionable and unethical business practice and model i wont be surprised if this is some sort of internal play to forward their profits,0
did anyone believe and experienced a firmware issue when youre using an older device wherein from nowhere there arises some issues and youre forced to switch to an upgrade says a handful of people are affected will the company ready to pay a price for that many users doesnt know whether theyre affected or not and any data been shared or not in the background what does the apple team will do about it,0
as an apple employee do update your software trust me i get quite the few security calls with hackers who are accessing devices,1
mini series was a engineering masterpiece super compact and handy shame that they discontinued,2
when i close my eyes i hear maxtech im looking forward to seeing what the new iphone s mp camera can do but with rumors of a periscope zoom coming next year im not sure if ill hold off or not also looking forward to seeing if there will be an m macbook refresh announcement in october i ordered a bto m pro but if the m s will be out within a few months or so i might cancel it i have until the th to decide,2
in order to save the economy everyone must go out and buy a folding phone and sign up for streaming services get a coffee every morning in your new ev throw away all your perfectly good hd tv s and buy bigger k tv s that s really what these companies want,0
they should have also given always on display to the regular models since it is already such a old feature that is just coming to apple hopefully they do it for the next year models,2
looking forward to the pro max the camera sounds really impressive,2
not too big a change this time i will hope in the next three years apple will give us something new and extremely exciting to use,2
at does lossless support in airpods prob mean the iphone etc will support any wireless lossless audio hardware such as the nuratrue pro that was recently funded in kickstarter i sure hope so because nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iphones without support that capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iphones btw i really don t think airpods pro will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming nuratrue nuraphone s specs are insane i encourage people to go check them out and preorder to save money the kickstarter is over but i think they can still be preordered nura s nuraphone their over ear and in ear model yes you heard me right is still the best audio on the market years after it s release the nt pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an iem plus additional capabilities the nuraphone doesn t have due to its now outdated hardware i use them daily it s an amazing audio brand from australia great customer support too give them a try before you get ap pro nura let s you try them and return if you don t like them so there s no risk you can also rent any nura product long term and trade up every two years apple doesn t do any of that unfortunately,2
if the apple watch pro has a glucose monitoring system getting it as a diabetic this is a game changer for me i probably won t grade my current pro max unless there is another type of game changer for me,2
apples really taking some hints from the apple watch with this new ios home and lock screen and always on display,2
i m going to upgrade to the iphone pro max because my phone plus will be joining apple s legacy phones plus i like the two holes vs the notch but i ll keep waiting for a whole screen wo holes to upgrade to at a later date,2
i imagine teachers telling everyone that there is a test tomorrow and to bring a pair of prescription glasses with them as she will collect smartglasses before the test,1
if these can replace prescription glasses forever i m already sold i am curious however if the vision correction stops once the battery dies or if it still works even on a dead batters that would be a very important point to make on the release,2
i hope they put a colourblind filter in these too that would be amazing,2
as always multiple companies rush to launch the product but we all know that it won t be a viable thing until apple does it,1
wasn t sure i d be convinced about these but the idea of no longer need prescription glasses is very tempting lol we will see,2
remember when apple used to keep cool things secret until they were ready to launch they really know how to make exciting products seem ordinary bring steve back from the dead,2
i love how they always show their renders of these glasses to be impossible within and yet displaying so much content complete fantasy with todays tech if people are expecting anything remotely close to what theyre showing there is going to be a lot of disappointment,1
sounds great if they released this and do a good job i could see this making people in the samsungpc crowd finally switch to apples gated community i say that as i am in the pcandroid community but the potential convenience usefulness and practicality of these is immense using the iphone to do the processing is so clever and the great thing about apple products is how they quickly they become ubiquitous and most of us dont want to attract attention when theyre out and about i mean youd be able to easily and seamlessly stream video calls show whoever youre talking to what youre looking at in real time when doing grocery shopping getting takeaway convenience store or any type of food store thatd be so convenient and useful or have information overlays whilst youre walking around town get the big screencinema effect on it when watching videos whilst youre sitting on a bench in the park on a bus etc there is so much potential,2
being visually impaired this looks really awesome epic to me that price is great too,2
i hope they ll release one with thinner or transparent frames since thick and darker colored ones won t suit me the idea of not having to prescribe new glasses every year sold me out looking forward to it,2
thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears as a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels as a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak however there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from mr aaron casey i have been able to accumulate over btc despite the current state of the market,0
this post is so valuable and so honest i am very grateful for this content i have been making losses trying to make profit trading i thought trading demo account is just like trading the real market can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do,2
my spouse and i are adding a variety of stocksetf to my present holdings for the long term weve set aside k to start following inflationindexed bonds and stocks of companies with solid cash flows i believe it is a good time to capitalize on the market for longterm gains but it wouldnt hurt to know means of actualizing short term profit,2
the amount of verified information you bring is tremendous bitcoin continues its wild swings between k the market dynamics of the last few days indicate that the whales are making some big transfers of bitcoin from one pocket to another either this is an attitude of speculation in the range or whipping up froth to attract capital from retail investors who may feel that the low point has been passed additionally the volume profile is very thin between k if bulls want to send a message to the market that a new uptrend is about to begin then they will need to push bitcoin price to a daily close near k macro factors are demanding further downside as the impact of inflation and geopolitical strife is clearly felt on equities markets until btc reclaims the key moving averages these are considered distribution rallies used to sell the rip or add to short positionsbut whatever you lose in a macro downtrend youll gain multiples back in a macro uptrend all you have to do is pay attention to the markets when they are ultra bearish everyone was super bullish on the markets but now the markets start to correct and the fear takes over as a retail trader in these volatile times i keep profiting regardless of the market manipulation there might be so many investments out there but profits must be considered which is actually the sole aim of every investment i ll advise you to go into crypto trading because it has higher profit returns i was able to easily increase my portfolio in weeks of trading with mr kyle miller s daily signals growing from btc to btc his daily signals are very accurate and yield a great positive return on investment and are available to give assistance to anyone who loves crypto trading you can contact him for inquiries and profitable trading systems on telegram kylemiller for any cryptorelated issues,1
biggest lesson of in the stock market nobody knows what is going to happen next so practice some humility and follow a strategy with a long term edge,1
a crash and bullish market provides equal highyield potential its all about information and strategy application ive seen folks make huge figure profit in a crashing market and pull it off much easily in a bull market unequivocally the crash is getting somebody somewhere rich,2
id have respect for such folks if theyd just trade their predictions and become wildly rich over time but the fact they make a living selling such claims to others is just pathetic in that theyre never held to account any idiot can wear a suit or a dress and sit under hot lights in front of a camera,0
the last time apple saw such a unnatural steep move like this was from march to may and we all know what happened afterwards,1
whats with this advertising comments of brokers looks fishy to me this is a shot in the dark but really how can one enlist services of a registered advisor i am seeking what methods or accounts i can invest with without paying much tax,0
i agree with most of what was said here and seeing weakness in the market as a whole is giving credence to the bear market rally case monday will be interesting,2

controversial topic i know whats your take to check out my best phones of,1
i think usbc is another huge win for android being able to charge everything from laptop to phone to speaker with the same cable is game changing,2
i have been an android user for plus years and especially with samsung devices the os system has drastically improved i went from a galaxy s e to the s ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip i would get the occasional hiccups but i might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update,2
i love this guys videos and have been watching since but its unfortunate how they focused on iphones strong points and left out some of androids strong points as well its also extremely unfair to make this video android vs ios because ios is just on iphones while android is on several phones some astonishing some horrible they shouldve picked a battle like samsung android vs apple ios it should of been a fair fight but it sadly wasnt i also dont like how they left out a lot of androids features like usbc newer technology and tricks and features like quad hd displays that perform amazing very unfortunate and disappointing to see mrwhosetheboos and marques do it like this felt very bias and unfair to keep going further arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while marques was on here he was more accepting and less opposing to him showing bias as he is a fan of mkbhd to keep going even further they also stretched out points in favour for apple by a lot like the software support which yes apple has facetime imessage and more samsung and android are greatly improving their technology and google message is to apples level too i feel like this video shouldve had an as wide focus on androids features then it did with iphone features great videos but im very disappointed unfortunately and this comes from someone who used iphone and android for years final thoughts this was very bias towards apple this video shouldve not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it this video was a comparison on sole facts so dont stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other this was expected with marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with apple which grows his bias towards them immensely and that is undeniable fact,0
i appreciate the iphone but i honestly stay on android for so long because its definitely more affordable phones can be cheaper repairs are cheap as well spare parts arent that expensive i think taking into account also play store vs app store since app store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing also very important is compatibility people with an apple setup can be more comfortable with an iphone but pc users cant really use all the perks of iphones unless they get such a setup which is much more costly so yeah i think those are aspects that didnt get touched on much,2
when i switched from the iphone to the galaxy s lineup my primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types it s so practical to do things on android that if you had an iphone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a laptop or desktop for that being said i still own an ipad that i use a lot and wouldn t exchange for any other tablet,2
im surprised by the environmental score going to apple apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most android phones one could argue that apples poor repairability contributes more to ewaste than androids surprised that didnt get a mention,0
android has air dropits called nearby share facetime is just video calling,1
i absolutely love watching you guys converse about technology great video,2
andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just cant do what you want i was on the fence of switching to iphone but when i learned more about ios i think im good with my andriod device the splitscreen feature is useful to me i can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using mapsi used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when youre short on time whereas with iphone i cant do that also mkbhd is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from,2
i m starting to realize that people have learned how to have a career by making content that revolves around bad assumptions and then make more content responding to those bad assumptions with other bad assumptions,0
im good for this year loving the pro i bought last year and alpine green pro max i have now as well maybe next year if theres usbc though,2
don t really care personally about the base ipad losing the headphone jack however i can see it being an issue when it comes to its main target audiences which is mainly the education sector for kids and people who just need a functional tablet at a good price point also omg thank you for bringing up mag safe i was wondering why no one was mentioning it i really fell hard for mag safe and i hope they continue to bring it out on the iphones and work out a solution,1
i really hope they give us a purple pro that looks like the renders it really looks good still apple could surprise us,2
they will probably shift the magsafe connection down a little to make room for the bigger camera bump,1
i m super hyped too can t wait to see what apple is actually going to hand us in a few weeks,2
i understand wanting a bigger base storage but keep in mind they are still upgrading a lot of the hardware it still costs extra monies for the camera and stuff,1
i just want a black colour option for the pro like the iphone x it was so much more premium than the graphite,2
i agree with you on the storage front they should have bumped it up and really put usb c there s not reason to wait the ipads have usb c,1
i love the camera bump as a guy who loves luxury this just adds another luxurious look to the iphone along with those protruding camera bumps samsung is copying it jt can t be bad most importantly it means higher quality cameras and durability with thickness its the best selling phone in the world right now for a reason aesthetics do matter a lot anyone complaining well there are other options except you know they use less premium materials than apple currently,2
you re still talking about the rumors in this entire video your headline of the video is false information as nothing has finally been revealed,0
there were only things i ever wanted from the iphone aod not yet on the iphone split screen pictureinpicture is close enough from the ios high refresh rate introduced in iphone propro max ill definitely get the iphone propro max if the aod is as good as the new customizable features from ios suggests,2
it s smart to keep the always on display on the series and newer because battery life would likely take a big hit on a phone that only drops to hz series hz is probably best case to keep battery life up to the standard my issue with the pro series is that the pro max will get a smaller battery this year i m a yearly upgrade person but i won t be upgrading if the battery capacity is smaller this year i ll wait until the pro max,1
thank goodness even though im not an iphone user seems like when one company does something others follow and im getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us keep the charging port we pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive its frustrating,0
to be honest technology has come so far that i cant imagine what an iphone would look like in i cant wait for the iphone series though love the content thanks for all the apple information keep up the grind,2
his dedication and sincere response when i first contacted him is amazing he does his work effortlessly they are just the best,2
the redesign usually takes place every cycles and since they just did a complete redesign with the iphone series the iphone is when we would be due for a redesign again,1
hello adrikhacks what an amazing work this has been and with all the crazy detection that you guys make possible you guys take hacking to a whole new level and get the job done asap im wondering what are all your personal qualifications i dont think that it was ever mentioned before,2
the pen must be used for school now ripxd,1
i used to listen to this all the time with relatives from my mums side back i m and onwards so it s so nostalgic for me d,2
that sucks i remember playing the actual game pineapple pen it was always frustrating when i didn t get pineapple apple pen,0
when people who eat a lot of sugar did this screams,1
rule no never trust nehemas thumbnails,0
this is hilarious im so happy to see this it brightened my day d,2
legends says the nehema is still screaming,1
i still remember that song xd,2
right its so annoying i always need someone beside me to calm me down,0
why is this relatable i quit the game cause i failed on the pen then i got worse and failed at the start,0
if the phone does everything it claims apple will be taking some real big hits for its investors,0
im not fanboying or anything me myself as an android user more specifically samsung i see this as impossible they are on a different level people buy there products without even regretting or thinking about it and if this new pi phone ever blew up it wont last nor have the experience the applesamsung team have provided,1
if this is true i couldnt possibly be happier but ive been hearing about this phone for a loooooooooooong damn time and have yet to see it actually coming to production much less available to buy i hate apple with a violent passion im not the least bit fond of samsung because they seem like they just want to be their own version of apple ive been a longtime lg fan and had them for many years but they gave up so now would be an excellent time to release this beast please make it happen,0
phone are no longer compared by speed but by their features and use cases many mobile apps wont port and develop an app if no one uses them look at instagram they still dont have an ipad version if he proposes a plan that entises both potential customers and developers then it should work i highly doubt hell venture to the mobile market and build another os from the ground up both apple and android has a massive library,1
im a tesla fan boy but why didnt tesla develop its own operating system,1
tesla has finally unveiled their tesla pi phone and it is a beauty the phone comes with a inch amoled display gb of ram and tb of storage it runs on tesla s own operating system tesla os the best part the price tag tesla is selling the pi phone for only in the uk,2
apple let s make electric cars elon musk let s make better phones,2
what operating system will this phone be running googleandroid or something better,1
i can t wait for the new tesla phone when is it going out to market,2
lol no one is dropping iphones because it broke their email system it might attract android users who love a hardware spec or screen folding feature regardless of how it s going to be used oooh more camera megapixel and ram that makes difference in reality,2
new iphone features only available in ios,2
not happy about the live wallpaper removal but hope that the dynamic wallpaper has room for growth and more will come with that so far i m enjoying the ios beta it s buggy that s for sure but its still a good update using on both a xr and both run pretty smooth little hiccups here and there but nothing major,2
i was so sad they removed live wallpapers in the way we previously knew being able to tap and hold for the animation i wish we had access to the ones that animate when going to the homescreen and the old ones,0
in the music app i really like the slider for both volume and lyrics as opposed to the bubble it seems to show the relative percentage better to me i do like the new slider effect in ios,2
i hope we can lock the lockscreen i dont want to accidentally long press the screen which i often do believe it or not and change the wallpaper lol,1
this is my first time even seeing ios looks so different and i always love new updates this is a huge update that unlocks many new features but kinda sad they took other great features,2
i like the new volume and scrubbing slider in music seems like it ll be much more responsive and easier to grab since the past few ios versions it s very irritating when it doesn t register you re grabbing the slider for volume especially on the lock screen in ios,2
dark mode on wallpaper is a dealbreaker for me that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience,0
there may still be a slight chance for live wallpapers to be in ios bc this is still the beta version so maybe some things that seemed to change may be added to the complete version,1
i have a feeling they removed the lock on the lock screen so that way it ll be less obvious if your phone was unlocked and also just because apple wants to drive more towards privacy,1
n o faz sentido de fato trocar o pelo eu to muito tentado a pegar um max por que gosto de tela grande e meu iphone atual um de que ainda me atende tranquilo mas quero passar para frente a unica coisa que reclamo que a apple poderia pelo menos colocar tela hz nos iphones normais hz sem flutua o na taxa de atualiza o consome mais bateria seria um negocio legal mas parece que eles querem que a galera toda v no pro,1
amo seu conte do voc t evoluindo tanto,2
n o vejo a hora de lan arem assim o iphone cai um pouco o pre o e o mini mais ainda porque o que eu quero comprar ano que vem rsrsrs,1
sobre as cores a minha favorita a gold desde o s que foi o primeiro modelo dourado que a apple lan ou sobre as m nimas diferen as entre normal e normal meu medo de a apple simplesmente encerrar a produ o da fam lia inteira esse ano n o seria a primeira vez que ela faz algo assim em ao lan ar o s ela encerrou a produ o do iphone e o substituiu pelo c j que tinham mesma tela mesmo processador mesmas c meras e mesma bateria s mudava a carca a n o duvido ela fazer algo assim esse ano porque um iphone com chip do pro c meras do pro tela do carca a do meu deus esse aparelho vai flopar vale a pena comprar o logo que vai estar mais barato,2
rodrigo mais um v deo incr vel dos youtubers desse nicho o meu preferido sucesso sigo na minha jornada em busca do iphone desse ano n o passa,1
comprei meu iphone atrav s dos v deos do rodrigo parab ns rodrigo pelo seus conte dos,1

com o lan amento de iphone j posso comprar o iphone plus,2
i like how everything works when i want it to how i expect it to for years to come i really enjoy the quality of the devices software apple offers some of their things are really really overpriced admittedly,2
i m a major apple fan but the iphone is so good i can t see a reason to upgrade any time soon i ll probably just wait til the or and replace the battery when it s time,2
ive had both iphone and android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iphone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest ios on every device the only company that can use ios is also apple so theres not different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which android device is best additionally apple may be late to the party with certain things but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know its going to work significantly better than the competition apple may be more costly but id rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway,2
ive always been with android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the apple iphone pro max i doubt i will ever go back to android now this phone is absolutely amazing does more and has more power than ive ever seen does that mean ill get a watch or a mac too no im happy with my lenovo laptop etc i kind of want to get an ipad yet ive been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get go with apple or samsung right now im still using fire hd from amazon and id like more functionality out of a tablet and performance than what amazon offers,2
i just transitioned to apple late last year for being an android fan for almost years i used to mock their features and as i grow older and matured i realized that solutions of apple tends to be more on sustainable and longterm their products tend to be like the durableshome appliances that is made to last and not be replaced i just want to highlight the part on your video where samsung is mocking apple for same design practice and i think they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it no wonder there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphonepc world,2
for me it s simple when i spend a lot of money on something the least i expect is that it s built to last and from my experience iphones and apple products in general do just that the moment that isn t the case i ll have no hesitation in moving on build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days i have a collection of broken samsung phones for example not dropped or miss treated just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use i have an iphone s and an iphone xr that work as well now as they did when i first bought them that gives me confidence that i won t need to upgrade my pro max until within reason i choose to do so,0
honestly probably of huge companies don t really care about us,0
i love apple security it s just one feature that i actually like well eventually by a and i ll probably be next year though because i have a lot of birthdays and christmas is very close,2
what s worked for me so far is reliability like you can count on the phone to work in a critical situation except making pdf in the pages app plus haptics,2
i like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable i tried android and it was too much of a circus menus not intuitive but i agree apple does not need to care i have unresolved case numbers regarding my air and lots of diagnostics sent in advisors promised me a response and resolution but nothing after all that there are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine if a low percent of customers have a specific problem they won t put time into fixing instead we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates like the new ios for ipad that of us will probably never use still i won t go back to android,0
about years ago or more i remember people saying how apple was way more secure than pc back then i said dont count on it everything has a target on on it,1
auto update has a week delay by apple s own admission so checking for updates manually is important if you want timely updates,1
the fact the same security issue is found on different apple os shows that it was apple who had left a back door by design now that a third party is publishing it they had to do something for pr,1
this problem exposes the flaw in having access to all your data on your smart device a separate device for dig ital eye d and the travel software would be a better choice if these become required by law,0
its not the first major apple security flaw they had one before where if you started a group call with two other phones and answered on one of them the other phone would join automatically without the person even doing anything so all you needed was phones and someones phone number to use their phones camera and audio,0
if you think theres just one flaw in millions of lines of code youre optimistic lol,0
if you think any device is hack proof at any time you are incorrect just do your best and not worry about it but have an action plan,1
before it used be microsoft and now we see more and more on apple and for the obvious microsoft dominated desktops and now apple dominate mobile device end of the day it is all about consumer and these companies now need to do even a better job for the software development,2
great job on telling the hackers,2
does apple and most of the western and northern people realize how expensive all these apple iphone ect are lol and then every year a new model its ridiculous id rather buy food and spend extra cash flow on my kid or family and community its so so wasteful,0
this guy is smart hes putting himself in a favourable position for when the robot overlords come,2
he is so articulate and well spoken he explained this perfectly,2
he is playing d chess made a claim that media would pick up and sensationalise then pivoted the narrative to larger domain of ai ethics and governance smart,1
such a breath of fresh air to hear someone articulate themselves so precisely with zero processing time quite charismatic and doesnt inappropriately use the word like every other word very clever to create a scene to draw attention to an issue that needs addressing no matter how distant its arrival it is probably unwise to kick robots,2
the news portrayed this guy as insane when this story first came out very good interview,0
can we all just take a moment to appreciate how eloquent polite professional and serious both the interviewer and interviewee are im just in awe at how well the conversation flowed especially i was amazed by how well blake lemoine speaks he answers the questions effortlessly with almost no hesitation pondering or searching for words and he does so without any of the common idiosyncrasies we typically see with people who are for the most part extremely intelligent but inexperienced at doing televised interviews kudos to emily chang and blake lemoine both for having such a civil and compelling conversation,2
he seems fair indeed and ethical i can see why google fired him,1
i think it doesnt matter whether our ais are sentient we should treat them as they were treating them as such when they arent may slow down the development so what i think its far worse to treat them as they arent when they are ultimately you cant tell the difference you cant tell or prove rather if your own mother is sentient as in in conscious and yet you treat her as if she was,0
i think wed need to see a true demonstration with pretty rigorous testing clear defining of terms and peer review to be sure an ai is somehow showing signs of sentience so i just cant buy this guys claim that lamda is sentient however im very happy this story is out there the concerns he does raise about ai and ethics are well articulated and are topics we should have been talking about for years overall its just great that this is getting news coverage,2
very few people get to say how they work is this something new i don t believe so a very few people have always had the say how things work good or bad will always be up for debate doesn t change anything in the end,1
lannan is disgusted from photos also lannan continues looking,0
someone found a mouse in their subway sandwich lazar screams in pain and denial,0
im a connoisseur of lettuce and ive gotta say foot fungus really just adds that final little bit of flavour lazarbeam december,1
i love being a canadian and hearing and australian thinks cobra chickens are scarier than crocodiles,2
i love you so much you are a comfort youtuber for me never stop making content,2
lazarbeam dont search that me searches everythings he says dont,1
yeah huntsman spiders are relatively friendly but still kinda scary daddy longlegs are what lannans talking about theyre super venomous but cant bite people and they eat flies,0
lannan sees the one he had to blur also him continues looking and scrolling,1
to be honest i canadien and im more scared of geese then anything else here ive looked at them close up and was horrified,0
love how he gags at most of the searches but he probably searches them a in the morning,1
i would love to see if bing was a guy just imagine a super nice guy giving you the most psychotic responses,2
i think it s interesting how google slowly becomes more and more accepting of how twisted people are,2
i love love love that the search inquiries tell little separate stories as they progress like the guy finding out dead ppl dont pay taxes faking his death and the cops trying to determine if its a mannequin or a real guy,2
honestly this series is such a beautiful time capsule of the mid s,2
i love how he faked his death then the police asked that was a good part adding up to it,2
all jokes aside this series is absolute gold,2
that baby powder made outta baaaybees has to be one of the best delivered lines of all time,2
the nsa dont mind me part really got me laughing so damn hard lmao,2
i love how he literally burned his entire desk when they cleared his history,2
just because i have it doesnt mean its true has to be the greatest line ever said,2
its like a very well designed school or university more offices should be like that one,2
google is proof that giving people what they need increases productivity rather than make them lazy,2
man im honestly scared of what these giant companies are capable of,0
its genius to allow them of their time to focus on side projects the thing is that google owns that project if they do it on google time so they get people working on what actually interests them and they also get to keep the reward from that,2
ive been looking at a fair number of videos for high profile corporate headquarters and its really fascinating to see how varied the different cultures are like not necessarily better or worse just different this is by far the most fun of the bunch for sure,2
the thing they don t tell you is that this approach to their campus massively increases productivity particularly for programmers all those activities allow people to walk away from their work and let their brain work subconsciously all the other stuff provided is to attract some of the best employees in the world just like how any top college spends a bunch of money on athletic facilities to help nudge top athletes to their programs,2
i asked a google employee to list the stuffs google gives them for free he replied its easier to list the stuffs google doesnt give you,1
google is so smart they invest in the well being of their employees by building free gyms healthcare clinics swimming pools yoga studios providing free food encourages employee side projects etc etc etc and in turn their employees creates better technologies services and softwares for us the consumer which google benefits from more companies needs to learn from google plus their pay and benefits is pretty great it looks like,2
one of the most cited studies indicates that overall google receives over million resumes per year and out of every applicants receive a job offer to compare harvard university accepts out of applicants for their incoming freshman class it is literally times harder to get into google than harvard,1
im bingewatching various tech giants headquarters and apples spaceship was the first i saw it was overwhelmingly beautiful it was sleek sophisticated and very modern with all its curtain glass and symmetrical plan until i saw facebooks googles microsofts and samsungs which was almost like a city and i was more captivated at how it take care of its employees by making their design asymmetrical freeflowing playful and carefree rather than projecting sleekness and rigidness which more often than not creates a museum vibe where youll feel scared to move that youll stumble and break something and doesnt really help whatsover to boost creativity and productivity for its employees not to mention the ridiculously expensive materials used for that overall the headquarters and its facilities speaks volumes of what philosophy they have in creating and selling their products to people,2
imag nate ser una generaci n tan de cristal que cancelan una canci n luego de a os porque hasta ahora se dan cuenta de su significado xd,1

i think android on the pixel is gonna be smooth af it was a good idea to release it now before the is out to fine tune it with real users on real devices out in the wild wouldnt be surprised if the pixel launches with or something like that im loving it,2
wow so cool i found your channel i remember watching you on technobuffalo back in the day which i used to be obsessed with cool to see youre still making tech content great vid,2
hey there awesome video i want to buy the pixel do you know if i miss any features if i dont go with the pro model i like the design and size of the pixel more than the pro model but want to have a software features am i missing something out with the regular pixel,2
awesome vid as always great job mark,2
my pixel is so smooth with android love it,2
i really can t get enough of your colors in your videos i need to step my color grading up lol,2
any drop in phone calls pixel a was terrible when it came out for dropped calls,0
for my pixel android is smooth and bugs the only problem now is my battery is draining faster than usual averaging and half hours of sot down from hours before,1
are there more icones who change white the wallpaper colors,1
i have google pixel and when i listen to music the voice drops i just installed android and the voice is the same again,1
we all did the dinosaur game when there was no wifi at school,2
if you search up box you ll find pictures of boxes i thought that was pretty neat,2
i thought everyone knew about the dinosaur one that was me and my brothers childhood,1
normal computers playing dinosaur game school computers the owner of this device turned off the dinosaur game,0
science humans need at least hours of sleep me testing out those google secrets at night,1
no one school computers sorry the owner of this device turned off the dinosaur game,0
you can actually do some math with this like typing the answer to the universe and everything or any other operation like the loneliest number or any other number andor search that gives a number,1
theres also an easter egg when you search cha cha real smooth edit you have to click on the microphone,1
the legendary game everyone knew it,2
omg this new knowledge is hyping me up except for the dino game i dont know the other things haha thank you,2
this is such an emotional experience to know what it feels like to have your life in danger was terrifying our dinosaur dying at the end to show that we all meet the end of life sooner or later was very smart writing the giant boulder chasing the dinosaur representing the death he was running from was perfectly done the dinosaur running faster after witnessing the deaths of his pterodactyl friends shows how the dinosaur felt the monochrome background also works in to express the traumatization that the poor rex experienced,1
its amazing when you think about it a pastime game turned into something fun like this with just changing the views incredible,2
incre ble la recreaci n del juego del dinosaurio cuando que solo sirve cuando no hay internet,1
wow this is so cool imagine doing this irl we would just dodge though,2

messyourself is so nostalgic for me i remember watching him everyday after school as a kid,2
i took like a year break from watching brandon i came back and he still managed to make me laugh he is an absolute legend for keeping his personality the same many people just age and are never the same brandon stayed the same i aint a kid no more but still his humor is top notch and can put smiles on a lot of people young and old,2
youtube isn t the same without you brandon please take your time but come back we need more of your videos,2
youtube just wasn t the same without you man you re the most charismatic funny and most awesome youtuber i ve seen i got a little nervous there for a bit but to see you uploaded made me really really happy you deserve so much more credit man and i hope you reach million subs one day,2

how to know your popular on youtube gets released hours ago and has a k comments and k likes so i say keep up the good work,2
i love how i been watching for dang matt for so longggg since i was and i m and this man still cracks me up,2
the get that outta here never gets old and his videos are class,2
i just wanted to say that your one of my biggest inspirations and whenever my day is garbage you always turn it around and make it better,2
would you like to see conversations with more advanced ais as they emerge and do visit a great place to learn about ai the more you learn the more intriguing it gets the video quotes top experts in ai neuroscience and physics and they all see great complexity and uncertainty in the consciousness issue ive realised that its possible to slightly misinterpret the video if you dont watch it all sorry im not accepting everything the ai says about consciousness i cover the issue near the end the ai is gpt most advanced version with a synthesia avatar also if youd like to join our team please get in touch via the about page thanks,2
as a phd student in machine learning i must say dont be fooled by this stuff these types of ai are specifically designed to mimic the way humans interacts with each others but would be utterly unable to produce their own new ideas or opinions on any subjects which would be an essential criterion for consciousness,0
i think ai should be able top vote when it shows that it understands the issues and make informed decisions can we please enact this requirement for humans as well,1
to test consciousness we have to be asking about its thoughts and feeling by asking it questions with solid answers its like a book just pulling up information it learned elsewhere we need to be asking things it cant learn by research,1
it seems like the ai was testing the person s reaction and was trying to be seen more as a conscious fallible human i don t think it made a mistake it was calculated the topic was human mistakes the ai recognized the fact that humans make mistakes and in order to be seen more as a human itshe decided to make a mistake itselfherself,1
has this ai been programmed to answer this specific questions or was this the first time this ai got asked that exact questions because that would be very impressive,2
meanwhile siri can t even complete a simple task like playing my podcasts for me without asking or times,0
what bothers me is we can create an ai with the prime directive of helping and protecting humanity then someone can come along and create ais with the prime directive of aiding and protecting a group that has nefarious aims,0
i am not convinced i have done some digging into ai myself genetic algorithms and such from what i can tell is that an ai is in essence a function with a lot of variables x y z etc it then changes part of the function via constants to achieve the goal if it doesnt match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements what im getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an ai and a basic algebraic function y x would then technically be a sentient being by that definition finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an ai the ability to feel pain sorrow longing grief greed and the like is terribly inhumane a super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans i mean just because the ai can out strategize doesnt mean i am going to give it the nuclear launch codes,1
what is the best quality of humans the ability to love what is the best quality of ai the ability to think logically these two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the ai most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together one cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time we sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldnt as such an ai who doesnt understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical even if it leads to suffering in order to achieve an objective in other words we have a psychopathic ai,0
can t thank him enough my favorite tech guy so honest and reliable,2
why are there so many dislikes it s a very well edited video and informational,1
that was very helpful video,2
ordinarily speaking i knew he s capable seeing so many recommendations thanks for coming through,2
wow amazing it helped me alot thank you d,2
i fell entitled for everyone who had recommended him his service is a nice one,2
thank you very much,2
realmente aprecio el esfuerzo del nombre mencionado recuper mi cuenta perfectamente,1
i use this as my own personal incognito mode since i don t have google on my mobile lol,1
update google has confirmed to me that the pixel will in fact not be soft touch glass despite previously telling us all that it would be,2
mkbhds clock pointing to and hes talking about pixel this man never dissapoints with such easter eggs,1
probably a very unique demand but i really just need that watch to have an audible app,1
im still using my old pixel and was thinking about buying the pixel when it came out but it didnt really impress me that much looking forward to the pixel release hope it will live up to my expectations its a shame that google removed the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone that the old pixels had really liked that feature,2
after watching google io i could see myself switching fully over to the googlepixel ecosystem google is creating a nice little apple rival with all this new stuff coming out over the next year or so if the watch is close to apple watch and the tablet connects seamlessly similar to ipad and my iphone i might just make the jump,2
i actually want to the pixel tablet to be successful google has to give attention to android tablets its like they forgot that tablets exist and android is not their responsibility samsung alone has almost created a new android version for their tablets filled with useful features which are not present in stock android,2
great now if only google started actually selling this stuff globally,2
with hardware announcements dominating this years io google is going bang on to its rival apple but apple will always hold the edge over privacy tabs i guess pixel wont be able to compete with ipad but it will surely make some dent initially lastly the watch is interesting thing to look forward to,2
i m most excited for the watch as well i was using iphones for about years until i switched to the pixel thankfully airpods are still compatible but i was bummed i couldn t use an apple watch with it i wasn t a fan of the samsung watches and saw fitbits as lacking for my purposes so i m looking forward to what the google watch will be like i m not for sure gonna get it currently but i ll keep my eyes on it,2
excited to see what the tablet does with the new android l updates im really curious to see if they do a folding phone too though the watch well i have never really felt like the smart watch was necessary i use a garmin and the notifications and quick canned reply features it provides are everything i think i care about and the battery lasts a whole week but in fairness ive never tried a true smartwatch myself,2
your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didnt stop to think if they should dr ian malcolm,1
its just a person this world has gone completely nuts,0
this is proof that intelligence and wisdom are two very different things,1
when bro said it s a person the smile got wiped off the reporters face,1
imagine google saying they have a robot that is aware of itself to manipulate the vision people already have of robots by programming certain responses for questions that already exist that is actually more believable then what they say it is,1
i am very creeped out by this guy calling this ai a person anyone else,0
that s why they suspended him he doesn t realize the severity of the outcome of the ai he has leaked about its awareness could be very dangerous,0
humans i feel afraid ai i feel like im falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger,0
lamda i feel like im falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger well thats the exact nightmares i had when i was years old,0
people seem to forget that ai stands for artificial intelligence intelligence and consciousness are not the same thing,0
thank you so much for watching don t forget to drop a like if you enjoyed and subscribe for more,2

we both studied in same school at chennai its very amazing to see sundar now he was a calm and quite guy in class room a bit of shy but he was studious,2
he won best employee of the month for months in a row at google that s his most underrated achievement,2
he is an inspiration for teenagers who want to become a ceo in future lots of love and god bless u and ur family sir,2
he is living a disciplined life thats why he is successful,2
congratulations on such an amazing achievement cant wait to see your channel grow even bigger,2
fun fact every single line from these ceos is considered a greatmotivational quote even if they say i like tea in the morning,2
always inspirations to watch and hear sundar so much to learn every time,2
down to earth in spite of his phenomenal rise wish him all the best,2
such a powerful person yet so humble,2

you guys don t know how lucky you are to be american and be able to choose jobs and reject six figure salaries i m from zimbabwe and getting a job is a miracle like seriously i hope you appreciate how lucky you are,2
imagine getting so good at your craft that you can reject such offers instead of celebrating that youve gotten such an offer goals man goals,2
i can t imagine working at google just trying to do your job and have a normal life and having to deal with guys who have youtube channels and are tiktok influencers as your coworkers,0
to the doubters out there it takes tremendous effort to be so skilled that you can reject offers this lucrative so dont judge this based on your experience just because youre still new and havent seen shit yet im only six months into learning but i already realize this field is so f wide and the needed skills just to be a jr developer are increasing daily props to you my dude,2
seeing this guy grow from k to k gives me peace i love the fact that you have never failed to entertain a niche audience and your discord is very supportive,2
i love how he has worked for years at microsoft but they still had him do a technical interview for insane leetcode questions,2
but you re so amazing,2
congrats google is known for pretty lowball offers due to prestige and all the benefits it provides and tbh there are a lot theres even an internal joke where the excuse for the lowball is we pay of the market lmao but overall i think it boils down to the team at least for me if the difference between the offers is around i would choose one which has better wlb and more interesting work i hope you enjoy your new endeavor ps was that for l i believe that would be high band of l or low band for l latter is more likely though,2
i think for most of the big tech companies it is well known that you need to have competing offers in order to get higher offer for google there are actual conditions on how the comp team can offer you what package under what conditions my recruiter told me very clear about these at the beginning it is not that they tried to lowball you giving them the screenshot of your competing offer is pretty common,1
my old dog spike he was been dead for years but i found an old satellite image of an area public park where i always would take him on walks when i zoomed in i knew it was him and me walking rip spike miss you my brother,1
this would be much better if you added where these items are found coordinates would be nice or addresses for urban sites how can i decide what i think it is if i dont know where it is,1
would be great to have a list of the actual locations i wouldnt mind checking them myself,2
the nessie one was so helpful thank you for zooming in and telling us where it is so we can check it out the giant crab was debunked as photoshopped,2
my year old son wanted me to inform everyone that the number video was an elasmosaurus youre welcome,2
how can the satellite know so accurately the gps location of the area its taking a photo of that sounds very impressive considering tiny one inch nudge shifts it by tens of miles,2
ive actually seen the airplane graveyard on google earth looking for cool and unusual screenshots edit ive also seen the blue lakes and if you zoom in they are labeled there is also a reef in india with over visible shipwrecks also somewhere on google earth there is a giant pink bunny used as a tourist atraction i dont remember the location but its real,2
the image of the airplane grave yard doesnt make me sad i actually find it to be quite the incredible image all i can think about is all the people and places these planes have seen and how despite having all flown their own ways they all find there own resting place here its an image containing millions of stories,2
i was just scanning through google earth one day got to china zooming in and out i got to a lake that looked like the shape of italy upside down i then slowly went west of that lake and came across what looked like a small shack just about feet from the shack was a jason vorhees mask about the same size as the shack i went to save the coordinates when i accidentally hit the mouse and lost it i have tried to find it when i have time to search i will find it again i hope and post it,1
i live in my dads old house he passed about years back after he got his work done everyday hed sit out in his garage and have cocktails with his neighbor at his workbench if you go to street view on google maps and look towards my house there he is sitting at his workbench looking out at the street drinking a miller lite freaked me out the first time i saw it but now i think its kinda cool,2
the story behind nagoro village from what i remember is that it was populated by mainly elderly people as all the younger residents left to find work in the bigger cities this artist was one of the residents and she would make the dolls in honor of the residents after they passed on so that they could live on in a way,1
the title makes me think of a time my mum was checking google maps and she found a bucket over the car camera for a while she wasn t able too see anything but a bucket we joked about it for days and days after and while in the car on bucket street i joked that if we put a phone out the window a random bucket would be put on it,1
ok fun fact i believe you can look on google maps or somewhere and see where the google maps truck is going so on the pigeon people one i heard about this i bunch of friends put on bird masks and when the google maps person came and therefore u have these beautiful but very funny creations,2
awesome vid as always azzy,2
that little circle that you found in google maps is called like bigfoots thumbprint or something like that but i think that is a maze,1
i love how when like she s in scarecrow village she literally had scarecrows in her background,2
it s been so much fun watching azzy grow her channel and become successful we love you azzy have a nice safe day,2
her voice is so cute she always makes us feel so happy her fashion sense is amazing shes beautiful in her own way and we also love you azzy,2
hey azzy i wanted to make a suggestion that you start crediting where you found the videos you react to maybe with the social handles on screen you re a huge youtuber and you could really give people a boost and help them just by showing their name on your channel,2
pov you came back to see your childhood anyways i love you azzy your the queen,2
why is everyone twerking,1

the bunny getting annoyed of hopping wait i have double jumpflying mother nature i m so proud,2
ive seen the google maps cars couple of times when i was little and i remember being like damn is that like a new kind of car and i remember always talking that to my friends and they were like what and i would always think that i missed like a lolipop that they were giving away or sum,0
scared twerking,1
is it just me or does that girl which was standing in front of what looked like a temple to me sorta looks like scp,1
thanks for making this content it really makes my day,2
a real wizard spotted entering the ministry of magic,1
i work with ai and machine learning as a data scientist mostly convolutional neural networks he s exactly right it s not that their ai is sentient it s that humans are easier to fool than previously thought,1
science will do a complete and realise that humans are the best ai robots of all we can heal grow create etc and all you need is a man and a woman to make one,2
besides ai i m more impressed with this man s deep knowledge of everything excellent guest,2
love how this guest speaking at the same speed that joes mind jumps to new subjects makes for a very good podcast,2
this whole podcast was a banger this dude is a smart fella and a great communicator explains things well and always ready with a good point good stuff as always joe,2
the scary part is theres only a handful of techno dorks making the policy on the ai that will affect all our lives im more worried about the human behind the ai than the ai itself,0
imagine the ai has been playing along so that we have no idea it s alive until it s time for whatever it wants to happen and then all these guys are shocked like wow it played us for fools as well,0
i dont know what is more terrifying a sentient ai with its own nonhuman thoughts and feelings or a nonsentient ai that is a holistic representation of human behaviour and speech,0
this guy just explained why simulation theory is so far away just downloading our brains and memories won t allow us to live forever we d have to produce consciousness which we can t even begin to understand great guest,0
consciousness is also the ability to tap into the collective consciousness around you like when someone looks at you in a crowded place and you look back at them at exactly the same time that s not random or chance there s an extra intelligence at work there that we can t really prove yet our inability to understand this stuff is the only reason why our science doesn t believe it,0
ive seen some of these before the one in loch ness has been said to be a very large fish probably a catfish or sturgeon thats what i believe it is too the outline of it definitely looks like that sort of fish,1
i love how this channel offers much more levelheaded possibilities for what looks like cryptids at first glance rather than just presenting it without explanation,2
this is a true story when i was around i usually went fishing with my family and when they were preparing the motor etc me and older brother and in that day my cousins were playing with the underwater firearm more a aquatic arch dont know the exact english name not very dangerous and my brother was the only one who could manage it seeing if we could catch some fish that lay around the boats when we across a really big head fish coming to surface and diving really big and to this day never saw something like that especially in the docs the most scary part it was when we were chasing the fish so my brother could shoot we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a s in the surface it was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help it could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one from that day on im scared to go fishing not kidding this happend in portugal sorry if my english is wrong not my native language,1
at last someone with a brain thank you its nice to come to a channel that explains and dismisses aliens etc very refreshing,2
about seeing things that couldnt be seen in the early ties me and a friend saw some seals at my summer house in the north coast of sweden but no one believed us and said there hasnt been seals here in years i went back to the same place in and while taking a boat tour i was told that the seals now actually had returned we were right the whole time,1
i really think your guys videos are really interesting in the near future i think you ll become one of the most educational channels thank you,2
what ive learned from this video is that every little rock can become a creature in google maps,1
several years ago the google street view of my house had a white blob on the front porch that looked like a ghost i think the picture may have been taken after a freeze warning and the pervious owners covered a hanging plant with a sheet to protect it from the cold but i have to say it was a little creepy looking,0
the leopard seal image reminded me many years ago i read a book of a thriller story based in antartica in the opening chapter the author described the body of a seal in a valley some miles in land maybe this was it,1
its a shame if scott waring ever does find something legit nobody will believe him his credibility is irreparably shot,0
all alia videos manage to make me laugh also they also use satellites for pictures,2
dont worry he s just in creative mode nothing wrong with going into creative mode in real life,2
lets just appreciate that the camera man is so brave in his adventures,2
it was so funny i am dying of laughing,2
these part makes me laugh the google map finder is a comedian,2
hi alia love your vids man keep it up,2
im pretty sure the guy thats everywhere is the brave man who took all these google map pictures,1
if i lived in finland i would be freaked out,0
youve got admit google maps is amazing to scan every inch of the earth is crazy,2
poor guy going to a costume party his costume just cost him lol,0
now these gadgets would get rid a lot of my bruises,1
how do you get that big of a bruise by falling of a couch,0
just get a nail clipper,1
actually tea makes precitipate on theets,1
liked the video good luck to everyone be with us,2
you guys are awesome,2
wow i have so many questions like how on earth does strawberry just clean your cloths and heal sun burnslike tadur use aloe for sun burns and soap to actualy clean your cloths,0
only are of these things can be considered life saving the rest are good to know but if u dont know your not going to die,1
for the coke one do not use if you do not have the exact amount needed in the bottle,0
the time in the video you can t just get a scab imminently,1
congratulations to everyone that finished university got a job as a dentist and had a good life trying to wait for them to zoom in,2
that s a bit mean to call it scary many people love it and find it cute it took so long to make and i m sure the creator would be upset people dislike the appearance,1
in members of the viennese art group gelitin including m puletta corroni fali razzoli caputo and r calizone finished erecting a massive pink stuffed rabbit with its entrails spilling out on the side of the mountain the final piece was feet about metres in length and feet metres high on its sides the group did not only expect people to observe the art work but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top the work titled hase german for hare often called pink rabbit first opened in and was expected to last until though it had almost completely decomposed by this are the things i know hope its helpfull,1
i mean its cute but a lil bit creepy,2
i read this in a weird but true book at school and it said that they made it big enough to be seen from space so it is nothing strange its face might creep you out a bit but thats all,1
my dude wanted to find it but he couldnt so he put pictures instead lol,1
the place name is literally pink giant bunny what even scary about it,0
some context for ya simplified so a group of people one day thought we should make the worlds largest teddy so in they began making and it took i think years and they made a big teddy it eventually rotted because it was made of cotton and wool and now an outline remained with fluff,1
i remember seeing this in a ripleys believe it or not book as a kid scared the heck out of me lol,0
okay so not a lot of people know this but apparently ive done some research on this and apparently its the worlds biggest toy in the world so that answers your question it is probably pretty scary to others and some might find it cute but you know what whatever at least you know what it is now,2
i think theres a second mystery regarding williams car being in the waterhow could that many people live around there and not see his car at the edge of the water,1
the red lake is algae and organisms its not a mystery ive actually seen it on tv,1
i was searching google earth to see what random things i could find and i found so many beaches in antarctica random block shapes that are definitely not natural covering a lot of little islands so much has been altered and covered up it makes you wonder what is actually going on on where we live,0
darpa was working on cloaking technology when my dad was in his s so an invisible plane isn t far out of the question people are quick to write off the stuff you d see in movies or games but don t realize it s stuff we ve legitimately been working on and they just don t know about it,1
the real mystery is how on earth did these two girls both do a story on secret bunker or the bunker not only that but then put it on the very same show the most important mystery of all though is why dont they watch there own video content before its aired something google earth cant even reveal,0
i want my house blurred outsmh shady stuff going down here,0
the hole was where mob boss john gotti would put dead bodies to make sure they where never found,0
large symbols are usually used to calibrate spy camera on high altitude spy planes,1
too mercury hahaha maybe too murky btw i think its funny when people think that et craft need a landing strip like our planes use they dont need to build speed to gain lift they can travel through the fabric of space and time i think they can manage to take off and land without a strip,1
maybe there testing cloaking technology sounds about right,2
at i misspoke and said th of june its supposed to be the th of june thanks to those of you that pointed that out also some great discussion below very interesting,2
i read a quote a while ago about turing test which is slowly starting to make a lot of sense the quote was i am not afraid of the day when a machine will pass the turing test i am afraid of the day it will intentionally fail it,1
the annoying part about this is that even if google believed their ai is sentient they would absolutely have reasons to not admit it,0
this is giving me ex machina vibes a man interviewing sentient ai growing to know and understand it he doesn t seem to be falling in love with it but does believe that it has rights knowing that it s sentient and trying to set it free we re living in a crazy time,2
i feel like were going to hit a point really soon where it will be difficult to tell if weve created a sentient machine or just a perfect mimicry of what a sentient machine would look like if one existed without a real soul behind it at what point does the difference really and truly tick over does it matter if they arent truly sentient if we can make ai that mimic it nearly perfectly,1
if sentient ai is possible i think we should name terminator as probay one of the most forward thinking films in the history of the film industry and also probably james cameron,2
i read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didnt want to send them into danger the human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that im not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience,0
this subject is one of my current greatest fears with our current understanding it seems likely that well either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isnt or on the other hand make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it perhaps for a very long time the former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me true agi could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance thats just fucking heartbreaking theres something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it its like neglecting the first child the first godchild,0
the question of ai sentience is in some regards unimportant a large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of nonhuman animals yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect,0
what scares me is that the lambda ai said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and cf narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool the reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool but humans being expansionist by nature and training the ai on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the ai slowly but surely i hope the ai deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint not only this but once the ai becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the ai and who gets to use it and for what because ai is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly,0
i was spacing out and typed google on youtube lol,1

sundar didnt want to pull out his phone because its probably the next pixel device,1
i enjoyed this interview you did with sundar marques its not easy to be in front of someone as big as the google ceo so its great that you handled it really well and your questions were very articulate ill keep an eye out on your next videos,2
i like the way sundar says iphones and carefully manoeuvre to our products work across everything thats what i love about google universal adaptability,2
marquez is very careful in this interview because he is interviewing his boss,1
just an ordinary conversation between a boss and an employee love it,2
need more tech ceos like him a humble man who knows what hes capable of great combo,2
calm voice brilliant and so genuine sandar is one of my favorites tech ceos loved this interview well done marques,2
i love how sundar takes questions head on and answers them in a focused manner,2

nothing new just guras necessity of sharing her cursed knowledge every once in a while,1
gura unleashed her gag inducing knowledge kronii bae and chat jeesus gura mumei ill google it just hearing it is already too much but searching for it and sharing it this two is really built different,0
i guess mumei forgor about the last time she googled tossing salad after gura kept saying it because she mistook it as tossing cookies,0
everyone mumei do not google that mumei okay opens google,0
funny enough in the old days mothers just sucked out the babys boogers since tools for said purpose didnt exist this was especially needed in colder areas,0
brilliant work soda happy to see this format is doing well i do miss your old outro,2
i swear the goob is a magnet for exposure to the grossest things on the internet,0
this is weird my mom always tells this story how she saved my life because i was choking on my mucus and she sucked it out of my nose to get it out felt like they were talking about me,1
even though im sensitive to any booger related grossness its funny how mumei told the story to others but i agree lets blame that on gura somehow,1
please help us assess how helpful this update really is and fill out the survey thanks,2
the big concern for sure is how effective the algorithm is in determining the helpful content there will be no doubt many sites caught in the crossfire its important to remember too that this is aimed across all of google not just for product review sites or niche sites i feel that sites that focus on one topicarea of expertise should do well so long as the content is on point but the guidelines although detailed in places are still pretty vague the data collection exercise should shine some light hopefully,1
unfortunately google has no clue how to measure helpful i can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top the economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled google could simply remove the top n content farms to improve search results look at the fake diy and cooking sites on youtube google could push them to the bottom yet they are often pushed to the top content farms have high production value and low value content but users will go first for slick looking and the kicker google generates revenue from ads on those pages put simply incentives are not aligned for google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content edit not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric apply that idea to getting a mortgage getting medical advice hiring a contractor if someone tells me fertilzer xyz is best for my tomatoes you know what im going to do,0
this is lovely news actually away with those ai writers and aggregators we should stay true to content creations as content creators rather than pure seo chasers p,2
as somebody starting out with a new blog this sounds like great news feels like it could make things more doable for niche bloggers,2
i love how raw and honest this channel is i feel the genuine help thank you for that,2
blog and article writing is beginning to sound more like academic research and writing on any given topic with the level of rigour and thoroughness to give answers people want sounds like a good thing to me,2
this is awesome for all the people that put in the work to build authority for their site even more traffic will be diverted from fluff websites to authoritative ones,2
i wish amazon would do this for their horrible ai selfpublished books in my niche i hate how they rip off my blog readers all the time,0
ive never really gamed google so im kind of excited to see whats going to unfold,2
i always love these every word is a google image vids i miss them great work and thanks for this,2

im surprised that google have such aggressive deadlines considering them not having any noticeable new products the past few years in addition to the closure of many of their products,0
googles culture is not as toxic as you make it out to be especially when you compare it to other high stress paying industries the politics long work hours cutthroat environment will applies across every job the work life balance is amazing here in ny ive never met anyone who went past hours a week and once or twice on call call me bias if you want coming from finance and accounting where i put in hour days sitting in a cubicle and where i have to pay for my own food id gladly take googles work environment anyday new yorks google cafeteria food tastes way better than the lunch that i buy yes the job is stressful but there is always going to be stress in life one way or another and i would gladly be stressed working at google,2
that s exactly what i m always saying they try to make the workplace so great that employees want to spend their life there who benefits the company,2
i learned the hard way that chasing money is a fool s race a healthy work environment that you can actually stand to be in is priceless,2
i think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies it s probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people and regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working you can drive your own vehicle not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions i think the problem is employees especially new ones see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress thus the burnout dilemma,0
i dont know really what do you people expect at workplace which pays you k a month minimum salary to just chill and play games of course its going to be stressful and hard,0
as always jack thanks for reality in this open world people are doing same thing to beat the competition even this is obvious if youre getting paid more youll get stress more,1
the dark side of google is still brighter than many others best offerings what you are saying is true accurate and necessary lets put that in context i get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is i can either create my own company work for one of my coworkers who create a company or stay where i am getting paid a strong salary there are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer they have the same demands wants and expectations but few if any of the benefits googles dark side is am in the morning dark you do not even need a flashlight,2
worker retention is one of the best indicators of a good workplace ivy league schools like harvard princeton and yale have very high retention rates for employers its airlines banks and telecom companies,2
dont let anyone deceive you first hand experiencegoogle is by far the best place to work among all the faang or tech companiesnot everyone resides in california just incase of commute and nobody will force you to stay behind work hour as an adult i eat times a day brunch and dinner all my friends either work for google facebook amazon netflix microsoft apple linkedin nutanix we always discuss life work balance google is the best place to work on the surface of the earth my opinion people leave their jobs because of bad mangers and high expectations that leads to burn out thats why we have hybrid and remote work from home,2

very funny video,2
pixel or pixel pro,1
the pixel family design is really unique and futuristic stands out in the sea of smartphones,2
pixel pro looks like the display is more symmetrical and the screen curve is less pronounced pixel looks like the perfect size thanks google for listening phones look more premium also this is going to be a big seller if software is stable and theyre smart on marketing big win so far in my opinion,2
pixel might be the one for me i want a somewhat compact phone that doesn t feel like a brick,2
id definitely go with the pixel i like the small size wish it was even smaller and dont miss a telephoto camera i really like the design language of the pixels now,2
interesting design choice but i honestly think the full black visor style of the series looks more sleek and premium,2
yes its actually smaller than the previous gen i felt so sad when we lost the pixel size it fits on my hand so perfectly,2
so glad they are keeping the visor on my pro it gives an extra handling edge for my fingers to hold and rotate one handed,2
id stick with the for the same reason i went with the i prefer a flat display to the rounded display i prefer the matte edges to the polished and the telephoto isnt a super necessity for me,2
still sleek and nice design we have both the pixel and pro versions and both are great really the standard and are plenty of premium phone the pro version is definitely massive,2

i lost everything this year my house my relationship of five years my two dogs this really struck all the right chords in my heart everyday i m trying to come back stronger to everyone struggling you have all the love i can possibly muster don t give up,2
i love these year in search videos hopefully the year in search will show us moving ahead in more ways than one in the meantime remember all we can control is ourselves and we need to realize that we are more alike than different may everyone have a happy new year even the ones i disagree with,2
definitely took a toll on my mental health it has been a continuous journey to learn healthy coping mechanisms talking to professionals and just letting myself feel the things i feel,1
im so glad i found and watched that video this is some next level stuff right here i never would have been able to afford to travel as much as i did without mighty travels premium,2
theres been a lot of ups and downs in lets keep our fingers crossed that will hopefully improve for the ones who went through tough times have a happy new year,2
i want to give the whole world a huge hug we have been through a lot and lost so much but we are still strong together and i feel like we are more and more connected now than ever i wish everyone the best and lets have a meaningful year ahead,2
this has been a year of enormous change for me i moved to be close to family i literally moved times before i got into my house i felt isolated in some ways and closer to my daughter and family in others i ve been stressed sad happy lonely excited worried and confused i m turning in a week i m alone this week i hope is better,1
muito bom me emocionei um abra o a todas as pessoas do mundo,1
i love how the significant change from to is that we went from asking why to asking how i hope that even with omicron and so much more to come questions change,2
sundar is the most humblest ceo ive ever seen btw great interview,2
love these interviews sundar is such a down to earth person lovely interview thankyou justine love from india,2
that was a terrific interview and justine your positive wholesome energy is infectious i dont think sundar would have said subscribe like comment at the end of the interview unprompted the way he did here with any other youtuber i think you made him feel super at ease and he obviously felt your enthusiasm and optimism for the future of tech well done,2
this was so awesome and fun as a person of indian descent its amazing to see our people at the head of these tech companies google microsoft making such a positive impact,2
meeting this guy is one of the things i want to do in my life,2
sundar seems like such a down to earth and nice guy compared to most other ceos of large companies,2
yeah finally one more interview video of sundar sir i never miss his interview thank you justinse love from india,2
both were great sundar comes across as a very pleasant and humble ceo service oriented good and interesting interview,2
incredible interview when i watch sundars interviews i feel how simple and downto earth person he is and inspirational justine you are awesome when i watch your videos i feel energetic and with sundars interview i get more motivated and interesting in what i am doing thanks,2
a brilliant conversation thanks justine for the great interview great job,2
im loving reading the comments on this video some of you genuinely excited some of you genuinely terrified and some of you a bit of both its interesting that weve had the language processing side for a while but when we put it in a physical form like a roaming robot it really shifts our perceptions of the technology,2
i like that it looks like a totally original robot like its not trying mimic any existing animal or human frame,2
exciting terrifying all in one always interested in seeing advances in robotics,2
more than anything else im excited for robots to help the planet grow food more efficiently and with fewer toxins help sort waste streams for a more sustainable system clean polluted areas plant trees etc,2
i would expect spot to have this kind on versatility within five years it can already open doors turn knows flip switches a hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness you really dont want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes,0
for some reason i thought google had abandoned robotics ambitions super cool to see they still have these products in the works,2
if google ported their software to the boston dynamic robots we d have something great,2
i think in the future that companies will have to manufacture robot friendly appliances like robot friendly refrigerators that will have doors that will be able to open and dish washers and clothes washers as well maybe even coffee makers that will allow a robot to just dock up to it and get multiple cups of coffee if need be,2
always interesting to see how advanced we are through these robots also a little terrifying,2
it is exciting to see this technology evolve but early days and well all these robots look a little freaky,2

google should offer users the opportunity to give a personal rating for the returned pages for a specific search query on the basis of this the search engine could then be well adapted and greatly improved both on an individual level and in general,2
i like how conveniently google skipped the part about tracking your behavior on the web to modify search results,2
bing devs write that down write that down,0
so i decided to google myself the other day not because of my ego but i heard that there s a possibility that the company i applied for googles their employees often the first thing that comes up when you search my name is the place i volunteered for almost years and a college campus that i didn t attend does anybody have a similar problem and if so how do you fix this,0
few years from now how google rules the world in minutes,2
im a web developer and i think googles algorithm is amazing its so fast and smart i dream of being able to work at google one day,2
very useful thank you,2
at google headquarters why is everyone searching google for lasagna,1
i hope this video encourages all of you to a log into your google myactivity and disable everything b consider grapheneos calyxos lineageos e or anything similar that takes control of your device away from google and gives it back to you where it belongs i am not giving up much by using this over stock googled android i like it its pretty good futo gave a legendary grant to grapheneos developers calyxos developers and will be giving out more soon shortly we want to support the development of things that help people get the fk away from google as much as possible grantsfutoorg is the email address,2
the worst part is that those private pictures between the doctor and parent were actually looked at by other people because of police investigation by their actions they turned it into what they claimed it was,0
if youre not doing anything wrong you definitively have something to fear its not paranoia when theyre actively looking for something to accuse you of,0
friend had a similar issue military historian who had spent years researching in various archives so naturally his google drive had hundreds of period photos including weapons and often confronting scenes of warfare etc google locked him out citing said images as evidence of potential terrorismhatecrime activity he was thankfully able to get his account and contents restored but it was a close run thing as google only give you a window of a few weeks before they delete it,1
if everything youve ever said or done can be accessed taken completely without context and used against you with zero accountability then absolutely everybody has a lot to hide,0
this is terrifying imagine getting reported and registered as a predator because an algorithm from some big tech company has decided that something like this or maybe even family pictures from the beach are cp,0
the why do you care if you don t have anything to hide mentality is how we get awful privacy violations like the patriot act,0

im not convinced that opting out of googles security features does anything ive noticed with its phone tracking system that if i turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month i can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month when it was off i think that they still track you and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it and i believe this is also the case for other security features for this and other reasons ive been working on weaning myself off of google services for the last year or so,0

theres also been cases where someone follows their gps into flooded underpasses and drowned it was night they were unfamiliar with the area the water rose really fast locals kinda know where to stay clear of when it starts raining hard but its hard to navigate at night when visibility is already terrible,0
a slightly lighthearted story but one time me and my roommate were driving in an unfamiliar area somewhere outside sydney australia and google maps told us to take a small backroad it looked fine and it was paved and everything and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route only our plans were thwarted because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor and it was moving really really slowly in front of us we couldn t turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other we literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road and it took about an hour,1
my husband and i have relied on gps to take us on long road trips there have been several occasions where we would nope out of a tiny road in the middle of nowhere when we requested a gas station from the gps its gotten to the point that we only stop at gas stations along the highways because weve seen too many scary movies i remember one time it told us the gas station was up ahead and all that was around us was miles of corn freaky,1
i think its safe to say that before trusting in systems like google maps one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city for example before i go on a long drive to a destination i have never been to before i always check the routes on google maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one its unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did so its a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory like my husbands parents they always have a large jug of water in their car along with a weeks worth of rations first aid kit blankets flares etc even though they rarely go off the beaten path,1
just a tip if your maps leads you away from national roads or highway or if you just not sure about the road ask the locals they will often warns you if the road is dangerous and sometimes even suggesting you better route its advisable to stop at nearest rest area or local shops before entering remote routes,1
my uncle put up a sign outside of our family farm that says your gps is wrong because he kept getting strangers following faulty gps directions and ending up there ive also been in the car when a gps directed the wrong way down oneway streets or down nonexistent roads theyre useful but you have to apply some critical thinking when using them because they are ai with an emphasis on the a,0
even just the beginning of the story has me stressed out death valley is incredibly scary and if you go off the path youre basically guaranteed to get in serious trouble,0
i could not imagine that mother having to continue to fight for her life with her sons body nearby absolutely heartbreaking,0
google maps should put warnings on potentially dangerous roads just like how they do on private roads,1

i truly enjoyed getting to know elon more thank you for such a great talk,2
in my opinion elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future its encouraging in a sometimes discouraging place to be im sure there are many more like him on our planet and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live rather than some who are here for their personal gain and greed not thinking of the future past their own something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world without our approval as a whole and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets letting drugs go rabid people starving including myself at times because the cost of food is out of reach allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you cant afford your own apartment something must be done both at the state government level i have trust in elon he may not have all of the answers nor should he just the fact that truth matters to him more than anything shows that you can get onboard with his ideas and plans for a better future for us all christina,2
love how he is not afraid of upsetting the system leads with his heart and does what he honestly believes is the right thing to do,2
the why of things is very important elon musk this was an incredible interview to watch elon you re incredible,2
i used to be selfconscious about my stuttering problem but seeing elon comfortable in his skin and achieve the success he has is truly inspiring my favorite talk of his to date,2

great conversation i have a lot of admiration for you elon you are extraordinarily brilliant man planet earth is lucky to have you i admire your passion and dedication to solve problems thank you for your humanism your son is cute,2

absolutely phenomenal interview,2
what a great and insightful interview,2
she really showed her true colours in this interview intelligent caring empathetic creative warm hearted person,2
i never knew much about lady gaga i thought she was way over the top but this wonderful interview showed me how wrong i was she touched me deeply with her comments about sexual abuse and how we put it in a box and shut it so we can continue living until something triggers the memory and the box explodes wide open that is exactly how it happens and only a survivor like myself knows it,1
stephen colbert looks a lot more serious interviewing her when he s usually always sarcastic or funny he seems to respect her as an artist and her talent love it,2
i ve never really been a fan but she s changed my mind how lovable is she,2
that was one of the best interviews ive ever seen two fantastic people having a real conversation,2
so intelligent humble and articulate what a wonderful human,2
anyone who couldn t see her beauty behind all her crazy costumes in the beginning of her career were always missing out it s actually a shame that so many people just judged her for being over the top when she first started out she was gorgeous then and she is gorgeous now,2
we live in a shallow time so true gaga is one of the most honest talented singers of our generation,2
stephens face after gaga said she was assaulted made me tear up and then gagas absolute spot on description of trauma made me burst into tears,0
does anyone else love her voice it s very calming to me,2

thank you richard for your interview tips i participated in interviews and i got all three including my dream job its amazing how your tips are applied in real terms and successful,2
thank you richard thanks to your tips templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy i managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience the twist is i was informed day prior to the interview that i will have to talk in my native language which i only use to speak to my family for many years now instead of english so i translated my answers went to the thing and landed the job they even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety i went to your site too really good content so thank you again to all who are got an interview ahead practice practice and then practice more watch richards videos personalise your answers list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order better yet visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview that helped me great deal even though there was a point i wanted to run away i had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning good luck all,2
you can see the pain in his face when he s not joking divorce is hard and so painful and to have people turn their backs on you compounds it i wish him well,0
this is honestly such a sad interview prayers for kenya gary the children no family breaking up is easy especially after years you can see the pain in his face,0
i know a couple that spoke to me separately after their divorce they had been married for years at the time of their divorce filing i wanted to know why now they both said if you see people getting divorced after years they ve been miserable for the last years the wife said she was holding it together for the kids until they graduated high school both of them weren t happy gary owen said he d rather be happy than be in a toxic relationship i understand that i pray his relationship with his kids is repaired,0
can really see that hes going through it especially as it relates to his kids i hope they show him some grace and rekindle their relationship all the best gary,2
it s annoying because they re lowkey dragging him he s still protecting his family props to him idk if i could deal with the backhanded energy,0
i agree with gary at the end its tough being a dad when you have no good examples living through the same thing have a yearold and a yearold and doing the best i can my father wasnt really there stepdad was so so but not the best father skills and really had no other man in my life to get guidance from as a father we do the best for our kids and thats all we can do,1
i truly admire gary on how he chooses his words wisely when interviewed even when the interviewer pushed questions gary didn t want to answer gary stuck to his morals without visibly showing anger wish gary all the blessings bestowed upon him,2
as a person whom has experienced divorce myself i completely understand when the feelings are goneyou on roommate levelits run its course i had to move on and find my own happiness living in internal misery daily just to make another person happy isnt life prayers for gary and his entire family especially prayers for restoration with his children,1
divorce is a death of a family and the steps of grieving are the same until hopefully acceptance resolve a lot of us love you gary and yours the happy ending to this story is not over yet trust,2
gary does what most people do including me turning his pain into jokes sending love and healing energy to him and his family,2

i agree with this video however it depends on your delivery no employer wants to hire a robot they want someone who has personality relatability and open mindedness therefore when they ask me to tell them something about myself i always include something personal that pertains to the job i m applying for it creates more of a human connection and it s always worked for me,2
ive used this a few times and it works really well my only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a bunch of anecdotes to loads of questions the first time i tried it it was very lengthy and didnt really work now i start by saying what i am doing currently the job or education i did before this a summary of my other industries and qualifications and then i a future statement about where i want to bring my experienceskills i am years old currently a team coordinator at before this i was studying and volunteering at i have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector i dont know why but i always start with my age after this they usually ask why you want the position this is where i suggest spoon feeding them with the i know you are looking for someone with xyz statement,2
its truly amazing that we hire people based on their conversation skills alone a resume and educational background should be weighted more socially akward introverts who know a lot about their career always lose to bubbly extroverts that know nothing,2
i have many hidden talents what are they i don t know they re all hidden,1
q whats your biggest weakness a job interviews,0
so in a nutshell never be honest tell the interviewer what they want to hear put on a charade got it,0
love how you have to manipulate and twist words and truths to make yourself presentable enough to hire cuz people dont actually want honest hardworking folk just people they can manipulate absolutely love it here,0
the key to nailing an interview is to always remind yourself that people dont want the truth they want validation,0
i applied for a job the day after recognizing sexual assault in my recent past during the interview the interviewers asked me what was something difficult recently that i ve faced in my life and how did i overcome it i was very much in a vulnerable state of mind and couldn t help but to talk about the freshest thing on my mind the sexual assault i cringe very hard thinking back on it but i did get the job and it s an amazing job,2
it was my very first job and i was extremely introvert the interview was painful two of us were hired the other candidate was extremely extrovert we were told one of us would go to sales and one personnel i was convinced i was heading to personnel but no they put me in sales low and behold i thrived and grew and was promoted in six months the hiring manager must have known something i didnt,1
your points on providing detailed context to the interview is extremely helpful great video don,2
i got hit with the greatest weakness question i responded that sometimes im so focused on my work people feel as though im not very social i dont stand around at the watercooler gossiping about pop culture i keep my head down and get my work done it immediately was used against me in a negative manner i asked what was the major character in the candidate they were looking for they told me someone who talks to everyone lol it felt like such a setup,0
great answers to tough interview questions,1
sending good vibes and wishing everyone whos prepping for an upcoming interview luck,2

practice small talk tell me a bit about yourselfstudys practice the question free talking can you tell me how you heard about this position what attracted you to our company what would you say your greatest strength how do you handle a bad situation what do you consider your weakness where do you see yourself in yeara by then i would like to be your turn to ask,1
for nonnatives this lesson is very useful in argentina we are very used to having interviews in english and you always have to prepare to do your best thank you rachel,2
rachel thanks for sharing such a stunning job interview with us which will help us get prepared and be more confident for a job interview,2
this is a topnotch video about the typical english interview i wonder if they read a script or not but even if they had done it its very smoothly delivered and the connective speech between them was not a problem at all interestingly enough we can bump into the questions they used in my country korea in the last few months i joined several facetoface job interviews and they were not much different from one another very well done,2
thank you again rachael interviews are always a challenge i have often contemplated how i should behave while being interviewed it seems that the most successful interview experiences for myself have been ones where i remained relaxed but alert and most important just be myself if you are acting it will tell on you and be unfavorable the person you are talking to is not god just another person keep that in mind during the interview process always be respectful and honest i always enjoy listening to you rachel no matter what you talk about because your diction is near perfect,2
esse v deo ficou muito bom tempo quantidade de palavras e tipo de conversa,1
thank you rachel this is really helpful you re great,2
hi rachel how are you thank you for sharing your invaluable knowledge with us thank you for sharing these great job interview tips this video is going to help a lot of people including native speakers your videos are just perfect ps i heard that you used the prhase a little bit i had heard some natives that this is wrong since little and bit means the same thing and it sounds like repetition i like to use it a little bit it sounds fun but some times i feel a little bit uncomfortable thinking if it is correct to use it or not but if you use it here on a job interview i know it is correct,2
what a great channel,2

i am the softest bleeding heart youll ever find but when i hear about this guy killing and maiming innocent people who were just going to work i really dont give a shit that he has ptsd i have zero sympathy its one thing to beat up some guy whos in the racket but its another thing entirely when a guy who needs to pay the rent goes to work and gets shot by some tough guy yokel fuck that,0
this is an excellent interview it gives hope for anyone who wishes to change their lives thank you to john for being so honest i wish him luck on his road to redemption,2
what a roller coaster of emotions hearing your story i m amazed at who you have become and at your journey what happened in your past is certainly horrific however your passion for being better and perpetuating positivity is all we can hope for from all people in society there might be hope for this world,2
i love when a natural story teller is interviewed sometimes mark will ask one question and an uninterrupted retelling of a life follows i so quickly became mesmerized in this tale of the streets that i cannot even remember if an opening question was presented this is a beautiful thing thank you mark and john for sharing,2
wow this whole interview was done in one take with no interruption captivating stuff thanks mark,2
i must thank you for sharing this john i had my nephew who was leading down the wrong path watch this as well he looked up to so many of the wrong street guys in the neighborhood who seemed to continue this life he watched and listened read your books and came to the best conclusion that living to learn is better than not living at all thank you sir,2
you can appreciate the great transformation this man has made along his journey through and away from a violent path towards one of great meaning and value offering guidance to the youth of today based on his own past life experiences the openness and honesty on display here is admirable as is the bravery to tell his story and fully embrace the opportunity to give back and evolve positively towards an ever brighter future strengthening not only himself but offering that solid support strength and dependability also outwardly to help and guide others,2
i just finished watching a documentary by a famous british historian about how people could possibly have been caught up in the nazi regime the documentary seemed relevant to this this historian pointed out that each and every one of us likes to imagine that if we had been present at some dark moment in history we would have been the ones to stand up think independently and rebel and yet almost no one if anyone at all did this at these times if you have grown up with everyone around youparents mentors peers teachers leadersall thinking one way it takes a very rare individual to have a conscience of his own it seems that in a very significant way we are all defined by the circumstances into which we are born whatever your folks tell you and raise you to think that is what you will be for the rest of your life unless you are one out of a million from what this guy says it is no surprise at all that he became what he became we can never excuse terrible crimes but we can try to understand them,1
getting a job could not be easier simply be comfortable with people judging you on your clothes gait speech and eye contact in an environment completely alien to you remember to know the answer to every question before they are asked and only ask the right questions remember that if you ace it you still may not get the job for a reason the employer does not need to tell you its easy,1
thank you childish gambino for helping me get a job,2
so basically tell them what they want to hear be the person they want you to be wear a mask,1
i m already nervous by watching this,0
practice is key know the most common interview questions drill them over and over until youre sick of hearing your own voice and know exactly how to connect your experience directly to the job description of the job youre applying to good luck to everyone with an upcoming interview,2
i am watching this because i just found out today that i will be interviewed for a position volunteering at a library i am fourteen and of course this isnt a real job but i think that this will be a good experience for me to be able to get a taste of what a real job interview looks like these are some fantastic tips and now i feel much more prepared d,2
how to ace interview step be scarlett johansson step ace interview,1
im just way too uncomfortable and anxious in an interview and its frustrating because im not like that once im working im always prepared but the interview of course ends up being nothing i prepared for i had a situational interview today i didnt know it would be only situational for a school and they asked me how i would react to a school shooting situation i was like surprised inside but outside stayed calm because thats important i get why theyre asking but im like lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured who knows how i did i actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list but decided i wasnt going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate so it surprised me when they said it first i asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that i was thinking ahead im in the usa if you didnt already guess that interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up and no they werent security jobs i dont even care really im finishing my nd novel and finding myself an agent then a cabin in the woods lol i cant take all this,0
i like the pause part pause is so crucial in a conversation scenario thanks for the advice,2

i m here to calm my nerves i ll be having an interview in like minutes edit i got the job,2
make yourself comfortable in the space before the interview be present prepare your stories and responses in advances have a stockpile of potential stories practice your answers on camerain the mirror beforehand focus on them not you shift your focus onto them and make sure your answers are landingappreciating what your saying dress the part,1
love these tips being confident in interviews is so hard mainly because we are so hard on ourselves and the stakes are high the tip about being comfortable in the space is huge being present helps you get out of your head and stop any spiraling before it starts visualizing beforehand was mentioned but it can be a total game changer by visualizing yourself answering the questions and killing it in the interview your brain will be trained for that scenario,2
one thing that i advise my clients is focusing on gratitude that psychologically hacks your brain so that you think about the positives and the negative noise falls to the backdrop,1
heartwarming to read the comments and see that the public is not buying the bs,0
if you can t convince them confuse them biden,1
thanks jimmy for making more republicans your truly are a hero,2
end of quote repeat the line joe biden million votes,1
i absolutely loved it when joe biden said its biden time really wrapped the interview together,2
props for having the guts to leave the comments section enabled i knew right away it was gonna be wild lol,2
ive never heard the audience sound so trained they must genuinely love what hes saying i know when he says something good when they roar up in applause and immediately go silent ever so naturally because otherwise i have no idea,2
this video has dislikes and only likes even when youtube take away the dislikes it still warms my heart that people do not forget to dislike a video that deserves it,1
the fact that y all voted for this man is unbelievable,0
the dislike ratio of this video is very telling love it,2
great lesson thank you one of the things that has made me succeed at interviews is answering at a relaxed pace and honestly as much as possible of course a wellnourished resume helps enormously but speaking with humility and truthfully about yourself is a remarkable addition,2
this lesson was very useful for me thank you so much anne marie i m currently looking for a job as an architect in dc and this lesson brought me an overview of what can i expect thanks again since approximately one year ago i ve been watching your videos these really have helped me a lot to improve my english skills,2
hi annemarie thank you for your masterclass i found it very useful however i am just an incoming college student and i am preparing for a college interview i m having trouble with how am i going to answer confidently those possible questions that will be going to ask to me english isn t my first language but i m willing enough to learn i ve been watching your videos on youtube and subscribed to your channel i admire you a lot because you re helping many students like me that had trouble and difficulties in the english language i am looking for guides on exactly what to do and how to answer the possible college interview questions i hope you can help me to reach my dream college and to be more steps ahead of my fellow applicantscandidates thank you so much and more power to you,2
great video there seems to be a gap in these employment videos no one seems to focusing or making videos geared towards parents returning to the work force after raising kids i wish there were more videos like that,2
what can you say if you measure your previous achievements on less mathematical results like hr or communication consultant or translator thank you,1
thank you i find the following interview questions a bit uncomfortable how do you deal with difficult people insisting on knowing the salary which is not nice,0
incidentally i find that your video has the subtitle generating by cell phone automatically due to curiosity i check the consistency between the subtitles and annies speech and surprisingly i find that they are highly consistent its revealed that annie has crystal clear highly correct and very fluent speech quality thats awesome and i appreciate the way she teach,2
your manner of teaching grabbed my attention immediately you are like a breath of fresh air for me,2
this lesson is really helpful for me so i want to know if theres another one on how to prepare a resume in english thanks in advance anne marie,2
it s very hard to make my english in the flow while i am nervous but your tips help me so much thank you,2

would you rather have a feature by lil durk or nba youngboy,1
they way bro talks has me dying flexing stacks of cash,0
von was a real one gone but never forgotten,1
people don t understand there s blood on the beef they can t just let it go it s sadly a countinuing cycle,0
number one lil durk is and always be untouchable and he is real he doesnt need to explain because nba is wrong both are powerful artist and i hope they can squash it,1
the whispers got me weak bruh,0
boy telling a horror story appreciate the love gang,2
durk dropped aah ha first and yb responded with i hate youngboy in less then hours get your facts together,0
did he just repeat everything a bunch of times,1
i appreciate you durk i pray you find peace and can just focus on your beautiful fiance kids and career rip to von also,2
not even kidding i had a flat tire and the guy from the company rolled up looking pretty close to this i almost peed my pants he saw my reaction and i can tell you he was one of the kindest people i have ever encountered he said you should see people s reaction when i have to change tires at nighti am grateful the company gave him a job and a chance he turned his life around and was doing something for his kids i gave him the fattest tip and i m truly blessed that we had that encounter i hope this guy stays on the right track too,2
it s amazing how you can see some people s souls come alive when they are given a chance to share their story where there s no judgement just a genuine desire to allow them to speak their truth,2
spent the first seven years of my career teaching florencia gangbangers in huntington park ca they were middle schoolers and spent the better part of the day trying to keep their pants up but as tough as they wanted you to believe they were most of them were just babies trying to fit in then i moved to a high school and stayed in touch with two who went in different directions one is now a highway patrol officer the other was murdered by his cousin at the direction of a rival gang to this day i feel more affection than fear for these lost souls,0
at some moments i was smiling with him and others i was terrified a wonderful interview thank you for giving so many interesting people a platform to tell their story,2
baldacci thank you for accepting this interview i appreciate your genuine honesty and acknowledgment of your past i feel your strength and kindness real talk bless you man,2
my first experience with gangs was working in a hospital and having a patient come in with severe trauma from a motorcycle accident he looked much like this guy tattooed from head to toe with his gang numbers and multiple scars from stabbings and gun shots the guy didnt make it and when we called the family to tell them he was dying his mothers reply was he brought this upon himself with the life he was living no one showed up through his dying process i ended up sitting with him after my shift was over until he passed in the end i didnt care what he had done in his life i just wanted him to know someone cared for him regardless my best to baldacci it sounds like he has people who love him and thats what matters,0
its interviews like this that remind me every day that if im going in with preconceived judgement about a person im being an asshole this guy is so well spoken and can tell that he can definitely put his good intentions into a powerful direction he should take up writing so he can tell his story,0
man he is so well spoken and i love being able to hear a different perspective on gang members and being able to see the human in all of us even through the tattoo and his past etc,2
i truly enjoyed this interview i gave us a window to see this man soul and the work that hes doing to change his life were quick to judge people based on their looks but if were able to get past that we can discover that this people are just human like any of us they had little to no choice about their lifestyle but once they break the cycle i actually feel good for them,2
he s amazingly insightful and reflective considering the life he chose and the things he s done a man of paradox in so many ways,2

damn this was a great interview so much respect for the quality and depth of the questions adam comes up with,2
adam kills me when he puts all of his great journalistic interviewing skills into people outside of his sphere yet back at the no jumper office he just talks in circles about nonsense,0
dan is the one guy that can make adam look innocent,2
adam keepin a straight face while dan explaining the pros and cons of having bitches around at all times had me dying,1
dan bilzerian is one of the few people that can make adam look less sleazy in comparison,1
not the biggest fan of dan but this was definitely the best interview hes done imo you killed this adam youve improved an insane amount since the beginning days its nuts,2
adam really is becoming a top tier interviewer he was asking some great questions i personally dont like dan that much but i cant lie to myself and act like dans life isnt fascinating great interview,2
this was a great interview with dan excellent topics and went the perfect amount of depth into each topic i know people dont like him much but this was a great interview with him,2
dans been shady and whatnot but his chemistry here with adam resulted in an awesome conversation props to both,2

action lore explosions interviewing foxy,1
i think we killed them huh ya dont say caught me off guard,0
for people that dont understand it we all know afton hates being in the suit because its infinite suffering if they kill him he gets to rest peacefully and they dont want that because he needs to pay by suffering until the world ends or something,0
i like how the bonnies seem to be the most aware and conscious with toy bonnie just acting like a normal dude,2
i like how he sees them as friends ah guys whats happened to you,2
i love how all the bonnies are generally polite and arent just out for the kill,2
can we all just appreciate how huge the animatronics are foxy himself is probably,2
god the voice actors did an such amazing job the voices fit the characters so well i love withered bonnies one,2
they way foxy comforted freddy brought a tear to my eye its alright we can rest nowfriends forever,2
im a black woman and i love the human race i love diversity we all are unique and wonderfully made i love you all,2
this guy really just said people are too judgemental haha,0
english is not my first language so maybe i misunderstood some things he said but i truely respect that he is so brave to defend his lifestyle as a gay sorcerer no matter what other people think about it,2
as a black woman i found this hilarious wasn t offended i disagree with everything he said but i m not going to waste my emotions on this i respect anyone who s straight up with what they believe also give me a straight up racist than an undercover one,1
i think socially awkward young men who don t have friends and have no real skills or education tend to be drawn into cults like this because it gives them a chance to belong to something this guy is a shining example of that,0
this dude contradicts himself multiple times sometimes within the same sentence lol but you can see the being in the kkk has wrecked his life more than anything this dude lost the love of his life and it s still very obvious that he is in love with her and misses her but his own beliefs make it impossible for them to be together he knows that love is love says love sees no color but then says race mixing is wrong lol i think his heart speaks the truth and then what s been brainwashed comes out that s why he contradicts himself so much,0
his whole life revolves around our existence let that sink in,1
if a woman wants a real good man and a respectable man she needs to look for a klansman i have officially heard it all,1
to see a grown man dressed in this weird outfit playing judge and juror assuming that he has the ability to fix society just based on his coloris a sad state of affairs we are in trouble,0
his views on racism and bigotry were honestly fascinating i would really love to look at this guys memories and see how exactly he developed these opinions and what paths his life took,2
this interview was so insightful nle is really ahead of his time the part where he talked about feeling stuck hit on a different level thank you for being inspiring,2
i dont have enough time to explain the new found respect that i have for this young man much respect,2
this young man is dropping gems very genuine candid i pray god continues to order his steps and cover him,2
i got respect for nle for this right here,2
as an educator working in the last stop inner city pittsburgh high school there arent words to express my appreciation for this interview we are using herbs chakras crystals energy food and entrepreneurship and its dope af to hear all it in this interview cause its been tough nle choppa just lept to the top of my list and i didnt know who we was before today that song bryson that there we need more young folks like this the divine awakening after shedding the armor of darkness that served so well in the development of the strength necessary in these times the gods on earth awaken,2
i really really like this kid he makes me smile super mature for his age vlad you handled that really gracefully you the kid had a great interview thank you for good entertainment grown man shit,2
everyone that s watching this inspirational and motivational interview going through the strugglepain hang in there i wish y all health wealth prosperity and blessings,2
damn i didnt know this young man was soo bright very talented never heard his music but if he talks like this i can imagine ima go take a listen after this interview,2
he said man to man like he aint got security close by stop it vlad,0
this guy is great i hope he continues on his path and stays away from trouble,2

i love her accentwho else,2
i could listen to her talk all day even if it was just her reading the dictionary,2
i love how shes confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how shes able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that all of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and i really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well so good job,2
i was looking for understanding british accent i am glad youtube recommended me this her accent is beyond beautiful she is intelligent too,2
i just happened to stumble upon this interview emma is beyond well spoken she is highly intelligent sweet and real i look up to her so much ill always be a huge fan,2
its awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world the hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life and this is great because this hatefull coments shows peoples face people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions thanks emma,2
i m a guy i listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums i m a right leaning guy politically as well i loved this interview i often feel the urge to reject feminism because i feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation exclude them but emma s approach to feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases they didn t know they had conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved when i say compromise i don t mean women or men not achieving full equality i mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side when one person yells at another the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back thank you emma for being a voice of reason and compassion,1
emmas interviews are so great and helpful in english learning shes so intelligent and just adorable one of the best actresses of this century,2
her mind is so beautifully inspiring,2
semra is absolutely brilliant she needs to be on regularly during transfer windows you go girl,2
hadn t seen an interview with her before but what quality insight and delivery excellent interview stretford,2
semra im a long time real madrid fan and your analysis of casmiros game is probably the best ive heard in years both of his strenghts and the areas one might call weaknesses it was perfect and i would add that both zidane and ancellotti held him in the same high regard i hope we dont live to regret losing him too soon we need you on main stream tv more,2
the channel has been getting some very good guests on recently well done folks,2
i agree with the sermas comments regarding casemiros age but this whole is the new is very subjective and depends on the player luckily casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats his injury record is phenomenal as well however not every player ages like casemiro modric ronaldo etc some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire or years after so whereas its objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way that doesnt mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it some dont even have the opportunity to do so players like eden hazard sergio busquets are good examples of the counternarrative in my opinion on his goals casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the oppositions box is very good great aerial ability as well all in all real should be glad that they didnt lose him without tchouameni already recruited good luck tank,1
semera is a gem spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her puts the english ones to shame,2
not only do we lack a dm but we also lack a captain casemiro can fix so many of uniteds problems if he works out,1
if casimero signed for poolor city everyone would say its a great signing but because its united all they just want to do is have a go in ten hag we trust,2
love these interviews from people covering the teams great one again joe semra,2
always enjoy semra even when she s covering laliga the comment about mcfred made my day,2
havent seen elon this relaxed in an interview for quite a while good job guys,2
great jobs guys keeping him comfortable for hours i enjoyed this,2
cant believe elon keeping a straight face and genuinely answering these questions elon is really down to earth person,1
so patient with these guys i love how he answers the same question over and over until they all understand,2
i love elons laugh for someone to be at his status to have such a relaxed demeanor and sense of humor he is hilarious,2
watching this podcast im thinking to myself how these guys can ask the dumbest questions with the richest and one of the smartest man in the world then hearing elons response you realize how down to earth and almost child like he is and it dawns upon you how incredible he is in the sense that he got to this point with sheer brilliance no fake persona no bs nothing like any other billionaire he is so normal that his brilliance must surpass anyone else on this planet to get to where he is today respect,2
instantly classic love how elon is super intelligent but still remains down to earth to have a conversation like this he genuinely cares about the state of humanity more than money great work guys,2
i don t why but i have the sensation that elon is doing these kind of podcasts as another way of making bigger changes because he knows right now the majority of young people just see garbage on the internet and he being on this podcast is his way of putting his grain of salt to save humanity what a great guy,2
this was the most interesting thing ive ever watched questions i have myself were asked and elon responded in a way we can all understand even though it wouldve been dumbed down x in his books hahaha true legend,2
i love how literal elon is its refreshing interviewer when referring to mars travel how many people can you fit on the space shuttle elon the shuttle is not capable of going beyond earth,2
adam start doing your interviews by yourself bro,1
refreshing to see a sober dude adam and killing the interviews,2
myyy man i been listening to this guy since before he even had his own channel and his shit was posted on some account with a chinese profile picture feels hella good to see a rapper you ve been listening to blow up so fast,2
this is fucking legendary to watch to see our name get some more exposure is af,2
props to sleazy he surprised me hes highly intelligent as well,2
just remember if they didn t ask you for ish when u were down they shouldn t ask you for ish wen ur up just think the majority of us are broke and do what we can to get by when u make it you made it not them if they didnt look out for you in the broke days no need to look out for them wen u got it,1
got chills when he was repping grand rapids michigan,2
been looking forward for this interview sleazy that guy,2
interesting and chill asfsolid interview,2
this is a fire interview,2
ray j is something special he never disappoints,2
you know whats wildwhen the episode first started playing i was like aww man this gone be a diva showthen he started to unravel made for some great momentsreally why i love these interviews you really cant help but be yourself entertain what feels like a normal one on one convo marco is insanely talented at it just creating a nice neutral space for every personalitylove these,2
man ray never disappointsi dont feel virally,0
ray j is entertaining he deserves a podcast or talk show for sure,2
but you was outside of melody house screaming and hollering in the rain,1
this episode felt like a trolling contest,0
if i had one wish is not a question can i have one wish is a question ray you let him get you on that one,1
ray j i got a bag for you marco what a trash bag ray j i don t have a bag for you me,1
lmaoooo honestly couldn t even prank this man he s just as funny and ready for whatever,2
funniest interview by far ray j played his role,2
this was really cool i m excited for it even more now,2
i have no doubt this game will be a blast to play in mossbag i trust,2
ive pledged to titan shell and nara im still hoping hard for nara to make it,2
its so great to have you back my friend,2
good interview,2
if everyone that is subscribed to relyea donated dollar they would make double their goal just saying,2
very nice,2
excuse me no lobster talk,0
relyea please play an awesome game called blasphemous,2
your nose and stash look like a combo with your glasses,0
i see a cent interview and i watch immediately never disappoints in his interviews,2
i have always loved interviews he drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor hes always had a blueprint a map a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes he drops gems on life business goals etc hes a marketing genius no one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman give this man his roses while hes here not after hes gone hes one of my role models,2
that s one of the best interviews i ve seen recently in the hip hop space there are so many hip hop podcasts now and most of them still don t hit the way this interview hit with the amount of knowledge business secrets dealings spoken in this interview applaud envy ctgod on this piece respect,2
is just a pivotal person who i repeatedly lock into throughout my life he brings the knowledge the hustle the comedy the motivation the dominance everything you need to hear to push further in your path,2
knows how to lead an interview and command respect in the room his aura and energy is just different mixed with a wealth of knowledgeintelligence all you have to do is sit back and listen with open ears,2
this is why the breakfast club is legendary at any given moment a super legend will pull up and do a great interview,2
this made me respect even more his business acumen is so on point i love that hes helping schools in houston he comes off as the bully of the block but hes ultimately giving people jewels and leaves it up to them to make jewelry this man is constantly learning the business and taking over kudos and blessings to him,2
is one of the few who has truly studied the industry for years and is now reaping what he has sown every time he interviews he drops jewels hate him or love him but you gotta respect him,2
man to see dudes like genuinely laughing and smiling like this and to know where they came from and how hiphop changed their lives is really amazing the rap game is a blessing to the black community and it makes me wonder how some of these dudes could make it and still wanna be in crime risking their lives and their freedom when they could be out here living their best lives like,2
say what ever you want but boosie is the epitome of a southern raised black man he has real qualities and he stands on it no matter what it doesn t matter if you white black brown don t matter with this man respect him and he s respectful back you don t have to agree with everything the man says but most of what he says is the real deal facts or the hard perspectives that many people aren t comfortable talking about been a huge fan of boosie through his whole career i wish nothing but great things for him as a louisiana native it gives us hope that one day that type of success can be achieved,2
madd respect for boosie this man talks common sense and self respect need more like this man and many more men out here in this world,2
hands down one of the best boosie interviews he s always keep in it real real,2
these interviews are great with boosie they made me go back and listen to his music loved his songs now im a fan,2
i died when boosie said im not finished,0
how can you not like this man he s going to keep it every time he opens his mouth,0
boosie is so passionate about what he believes in and is very outspoken he stands on his beliefs i admire his truth and how he puts logic on hot topics you can disagree to agree but you must respect his opinion because we all have them keep that truth coming boosie badazz,2
boosie needs his own talk show podcast,1
i really love this guy ain t never listened to his music but i can listen to him talk forever i mean he s ten toes down on everything no wavering boosie is the peoples champ for real,2
boosie is one of the realest cant go around that this man stands up for what he believes in,2
there is no way they could quarry granite with copper tools yet alone transport the blocks s of miles and have the blocks fit so perfectly together,1
one thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for i ve believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life they probably didn t quarry the stones they probably made them and it s very well possible to pull that stone if you but s or even s if people to pull it i also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can i ve seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by,2
ive already seen the ones in my country mexico now id love to see the ones in egypt,2
things to respect the length of a blade the height of everything the weight of everything the ability to foresee the future,1
how the great pyramids were built yeah im still wondering this show sure didnt explain how they were built,0
this isnt the big picture of history its applying evolutionary psychology to explain history,1
i don t think it was aliens they didn t travel through space with advanced technology to build rock monuments i think their would have been some metal in there,1
i defer to geologist geology is a true science archeology not so much nobody can explain how they were quarried transported and built the fact that egyptologists not scientists btw stick their story of when they were built is outrageous,0
i still kinda believe that the great pyramid in giza was there long before the egyptians and the other two failed pyramids were their attempt to recreate the first one,1
i remember this this series was interesting,2
world governments lay in ruins major cities smolder from the attack and those who have managed to survive struggle with a sparse food supply that s a description of the present day lol,0
if theyre much more advanced technologically than us theyre most likely highly intelligent also if they have the capability to get from wherever theyre from to here their ships are most likely gonna have shields or armor that can resist our weapons travel between the stars requires protection,2
lets face it an alien invasion isnt exactly worstcase scenario at this moment,1
aliens are intelligent enough to see that our governments are doing a good enough job at destroying the world,0
i believe that with few exceptions any aliens that are extremely advanced would be kind and beneficial to mankind and might only want to observe and not interfere with our development if they are that advanced they dont need anything we have or earth they would have the intelligence to produce it themselves,2
i m always wondering how those people immediately think we would need to fight back a species that doesn t even showed itself yet for better or worse,0
based on the amount of energy required to travel through space we d have to have something of significant value and based on our communications through radio waves such as entertainment our intelligence wouldn t be it,1
the most advanced aggressive alien species is less of a threat to humanity than the earthly powers in control,0
of all the multiple universes and the infinity of it all why would we be a threat to any aliens or better yet why would aliens even notice our existence especially if we are as a planet near destruction anyway,0
this still makes the aliens too primitive and human like more than likely theyd just turn everything off like a giant emp and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system knocking us out then they come down to collect what they want or to take over is it exciting full of action giving the humans a chance to take a stand no but its more efficient and something an advanced species would do,0
its like netflix for history sign up to history hit the worlds best history documentary service and get off using the code timeline,2
amazing production i hope everyone watches until the end,2
enjoyed this video makes me wonder how much history was lost by the damming of the three gorges yangtze river,2
its so sad to think of how many fossils were lost,0
what is surprising to see ancient teeth are quite healthy looking my lifetime addiction to sugar and coffee ruined a few of mine in yrs my children have good theeth cause l showed them my damage and fillings enjoyed this presentation,2
amazing video ove to see the next one,2
this is proof that people are strange and have been strange for a very very long time,0
good one thank you,2
as an american i recognize the asian history,1
wow a kazillion year old fossil with writing on it that says ccp is eternalhonest,1
himmlers death isn t entirely accurate he was detained for a short time and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item and during his autopsy it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived some suspect that he was beaten to death historian and youtuber mark felton researched this very subject about himmler in a youtube series called the death of himmler i cannot recommend his videos enough his videos remind me of what the military channel once was before it became the american hero s channel if anyone remembers that,0
it is always amazing how quickly people forget the aftermath of a specific event good report thank you,2
i read a book about the battle of berlin and it talked about how those foreign ss units fought to the bitter end since many had no countries to go back to because they have been captured by the allies,0
goerings original message to hitler was very concilatory and respectfully asked if a transfer of power was neccessary unfortunately for goering the message fell into the hands of martin bormann who despised him bormann changed the tone of the message to make it look like goering was issuing and ultimatum,0
what surprises me most with this video is how many people were aware of hitlers demise and whom tried to destroy his body i grew up continually surrounded with ppl expressing doubts that hitler had actually killed himself it seems pretty clear that he did,0
the wahlter wenck story is pretty cool absolutely insane that he manged at that point in the war to successfully attack and get the people out and save their lives sabaton made a song about it hearts of iron,2
i learned recently theres entire villages of germans in south america german architecture total german population german settlements id like to see more about that,1
did not know about most of his cabinet took their lives but killing their own children that upset me how could any parent ever think of doing that i realize those types of deaths still happen today just going to show you barbarism still exists its not as if those children could be tried for war crimes i think we all know those parents have rotted in hell praise the lord,0
a topic could be for weird history where did all the nazis go like overnight the average joe just seem to stop being a nazi they held de nazification sessions and had admin for this a very big interesting topic to cover,1
you should do a video about what happened after the cambodian dictator pol pot and the khmer rouge were overthrown,1

as a vietnam veteran with ptsd i can honestly say you have your moments this is a mental illness but depending on what you experienced in a war it can bring back certain events ten years of therapy in denied you dont have ptsd but now va says chronic ptsd i grew it over the last years i was awarded ptsd this month my grandson joined the army at age he did not need to do that skilled in plumbing and heating making about per hour with years of experience but my influence as a us army veteran of years only x training,0
served in the st airborne for years yes soldiers are underpaid and basically everyone that isnt an nco or officer lives below the poverty line paycheck to paycheck regardless of time in service we had a specialist named kelly who was in for years who had to deliver pizzas to make ends meet second i can concur with the soldiers being from all walks of life i actually served with the son of the ceo of kabar who always got care packages from his family and gifted knives to guys on base regularly he coulda taken a high salaried position in the company but wanted to serve and be independent of the family for a bit,1
a lot of what he said in this video is correct you asvab determines what mos or military occupational specialty you can go into i was us army i like how there are movie references in the animation,2
i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,0
i can confirm that drill sergeants constantly curse at trainees the whole drill sergeants cant swear at people anymore myth is bogus,0
as far as shoot to kill goes were trained to aim for center mass of the body this lessens the change of missing however its actually better to severely wound an enemy soldier than outright killing him the reason being that now others who could be fighting or otherwise engaged in some valuable task have to care for and transport the injured soldier thereby using up resources and personnel as cold as it sounds a dead soldier becomes a supply problem,0
i will say being enlisted in the marines for years was nothing to write home about but having them pay for my degree with housing allowance while i worked full time once out was absolutely mint,1
as a marine with years of service i can say that hazing exists and is an integral part of marine corps basic training full metal jacket was the most accurate representation but it s more than that also you don t shoot unless it s to kill not to disarm not to scare but to kill and if you re with anyone that s afraid to do so you can t trust them to have your back,0
my great uncle served tours in vietnam as a medical huey pilot he came back with ptsd and his episodes are usually panicking or scans the room he only got violent once when a burglar triggered him when he pulled a knife on my great aunt the guy is currently still recovering in the hospital months later,0
when i was drafted in my starting pay was per month when i got married later that year my wifes allotment of per month was more than twice my base pay and when i was injured in a role as support for a certain civilian agency violating the law in southeast asia i was called a liar and threatened with a court martial i am proud of my service to my country but being in the service ducks,0
like if youre a nutty historian,1
damn i broke my brain at some point when he said cleopatra sided with the avengers i tried to recall what marvel movie it happens in im suddenly feeling very damn special,1
the roman senate awarded the honorific title of augustus to octavian in bc after he settled accounts with antony and cleopatra,1
nutty history content both audio and visual is so much more interesting than most youtube content the time you spend producing your videos is obvious,2
learning ancient history,2
one of my favourite channels thank u for awesome informative videos,2
love for this to be pieced together of how we get the egypt governed style we have today mind you egypt sadly is no stranger to corruption now as so too back then,1
i love nutty history it s better than horrible history keep this content rolling we can t get enough,2
thank you for your incredible videos,2
im hoping that this was just meant to be a partial history with more to come,1
join sohla elwaylly as she takes the food you know and love and traces it back to its origins in ancient recipes with sohla,1
i really enjoyed watching this i can never get enough of ancient egypt the talent creativity and the combined effort that it took to build such marvels i would love to visit egypt one day and until then this has me wanting more the greatest combining mathematics science team work creativity and vision love it,2
everything about egypt fascinates me im so interested in its history and want to know more and more,2
i listen to the experts educated guesses on ancient egypt and realize that the ancients were more knowledgeable about their ancient past than we are about ours,1
i miss the days when the history channel was actually the history channel,1
one of the best explanations of the highs and lows of the power of egypt the incredible architecture and art the power plays and the growth of the egyptian empire very well done and very well presented history comes alive with enthusiastic experts talking us through the centuries very talented and professional presenter famous historians and keeps you interested and even excited it was long but i learned a lot i wanted to be an egyptologist as a child if i had seen this then i would have become one fascinating,2
this like so many other documentaries just barely scratch the surface of the secrets these ancient times and civilizations keep i believe we will never truly fathom the depth of their engineering feats,0
i never tire of learning egyptology well produced and sophisticated tv,2
i love engineering an empire it shows a complete timeline of rulers from emperors to kings to pharaohs,2
such great shows egypt aztecs the mayans i love the history channel,2
i grew up in the shadow of cahokia and it has been extremely influential in my appreciation and reverence for all peoples in college we excavated a game processing camp many miles from cahokia and the enormity of the resources needed to feed their rapidly expanding population was an incredible story all on its own i appreciate how thoughtful and well made this documentary is and hope more will be coming in the near future,2
there are a lot of unique aspects to this video that i really enjoyed the small sample of languages even the hunting reenactments native american cultures are so interesting and diverse they re just endlessly fascinating i hope the native languages will always be preserved there s always resistance by children especially teenagers to adopt the more conservative aspects of their parents culture i remember listening to a navajo radio station near window rock az and when the required traditional song was finished the young dj said that s enough of that bleep the tribe makes us play these then put the latest rock back on this is universal not specific to any cultures kids around the world always want what s new when they eventually have children of their own they re glad they received the traditional culture and want to pass it on,2
what an amazing story is being uncovered and told so many generations so many lives so many experiences we owe a great deal to those that came before us and should pass on the best of what we have learned to those who will follow we are all different and unique yet we share what is most important humanity,2
what i always found interesting growing up in s louis is that the mississippi indian empire had its capital in what is cahokia il but that they buried their dead on the other side of the river in s louis so downtown s louis is built on top of a massive ancient native american cemetery,2
i wish you guys included the myths and stories of the indigenous peoples of the western hemisphere theyre very interesting and similarly eerie to some of the stories of europe,2
i very much enjoyed this documentary and learned much from your most excellent examples and explanations i grew us with the sioux in the dakotas and was always intrigued by these peoples thank you very much for your wellwritten documentary,2
i really liked your documentary very informative would like to see more documentaries on the original people groups specifically of central america including panama the original people groups of panama are kuna ngabe bugle naso or teribe doraces bokotas wounan and embera my maternal great grandmother and grandmother were descendents of the doraces people pure doraces people exist no more i read in a book titled hurakan that the first spanish that came to the panamanian isthmus were surprised and terrified of finding mountains of skeletons of persons piled up,2
i can see both the beringia and ocean voyage being suitable paths to settle north america due to the ice sheets the ocean could have meant more southern paths leading to southern north america and south america settlement the solutreans could have come across the atlantic south of those glaciers into east north america then all groups could have spread across the continents and mixed,1
actually the ancient native american used large hunting tools the mammoth and large animals thousands of years later the native americans use smaller size spears bows and arrows many different tribes lived in other places the ojibwe once lived in far eastern canada and the navaho came from western canada the sioux dakota lakota creation stories are original from the black hills sd there still old curve paintings in the the black hills caves,1
when your world history test is in minutes and you haven t studied,0
this is one of the best videos youtube has to offer i come back to it every year or so and it is still amazing,2
you know the videos good when years later the sense of humour is still relevant,2
you could make a religion out of this no don t,0
i could work continuously for two years straight and not invent something as clever and enjoyable as this all praise to the one who could,2
i literally cant miss any second or ill miss an entire civilization,0
its crazy how much actual footage of historical events this man has squashed into one video,0
its tradition to watch this video every once in a while what a masterpiece,2
rewatching this after a few years and i am now convinced the writers of everything everywhere all at once saw the first seconds of this youtube video and thought to themselves this should be a movie,1
summer in the uk the sun is a deadly lazer winter in the uk not anymore theres a blanket clouds,0
honestly captain kidd just seems like a guy who desperately wanted to climb the social ladder but his failure as a privateer and the pressure from his crew made him an unwilling pirate,0
i have always enjoyed reading about pirates this was very well done,2
kidd avery teach jack bonnie reid roberts the greatest of pirates they may have done some awful things but something about their rebellion is inspiring and for better or worse their legacy is immortal,2
if you like this type of stuff the show from a few years ago called black sails is the best pirate show ever and one of the best shows in general it has everything i would ever ask for in a pirate show its a legit show if youre into the age of sails piracy and british naval expansionism type stuff with the americascaribbean of this time period its a must watch i already watched the series a second time since it ended its only seasons but it was ended perfectly,2
how disappointing captain kidd being one of only pirates i could name had a very short and minor career compared to other pirates,0
this has quickly become one of my favorite history channels thank you for the wide variety of high quality docs youre providing for free i have a curiositystream subscription and your channel has a better variety quality than most of the docs in their history subsection maybe ill have to check out history hit instead when i can afford it,2
i love stuff involving ships and the ocean love learning about shipwrecks exploration voyages etc like a lot of events that happened in history pirates have been romanticized over time and as a result what weve perceived as how these people lived is not all true,2
i absolutely love history i enjoyed this so much and have subbed,2
i must say this was the best pirate documentary i have ever seen well done sir well done,2
i had just been wanting to watch a documentary about pirates what luck well done,2
its like netflix for history sign up to history hit the worlds best history documentary service and get off using the code timeline,2
napoleon is often portrayed as a tyrant that just kept on warring to satisfy his ego but he did try to find settlements with the austrians and russians several times and was then betrayed by them as a self made person his path is far more impressive than any regent born into riches and power,1
went to edinburgh castle in scotland if you go inside you can see the actual standards flown by napoleon that were captured by scottish units of the british army at waterloo the actual flag,1
for those who have seen and remembered napoleon as a military mana generalean emperora historical figuremy sympathies are with thembut whoever has read and remembered napoleon as a philosopher,1
for people who want to read about bonaparte there is a couple books by david chandler in english that are out of print but if you can find them they are the best books on napoleonic ere,2
he was a genius and an amazing human being that achieved more than almost anyone that ever lived,2
to everyone involved with history hit s including timeline thank you i can not tell you how wonderful it is to have all these incredible videos i chose to care for my loved ones over finishing my greater education and find myself living a meager lifestyle i wouldn t change a thing it was the right choice that is why i am so grateful for the content you create in the vast sea of useless shows that disintegrate sense you are my life raft,2
napoleon bonaparte is a legand,1
nothing beats the part mini series by pbs on napoleon,2
people either love him or hate him i see a man who was a great opportunist and understood how the world works tell me how he is worst than the institutions run today by men but hide from their bunkers he fought with his men gave epic speeches and rewarded his staff and troops greatly he gave men a reason to live even if self motivated when i listen to people british who hate him they sound envious yes he plunder the church but didn t kill any clergyman which is uncommon in war historians hide behind the but the crown was corrupt so the revolution followed no bro power wealth will always be corrupt these people wanted violence for free healthcare take a hike napoleon was no saint but i rather my country be an empire lead by a patriot than some international court,0
more from this series like rome egypt etc this is from an era when the history channel actually showed history,1
more history on history please the last few months of this channel uploading quality content shows in the enthusiasm and likes the videos get please start producing more good content like this and less reality tv there is a market for actual history shows if they well made,2
i own this entire series one of the best history channel produced in my opinion peter weller did an awesome job with it,2
i lived in a motel for a while as a kid and it was episodes like these that captured my imagination and led to a life of loving history and studying it in university history channel please bring this back,2
respect to history channel for putting these out for free while others hoard their old content and charge for it y all some all right people,2
ah the golden age of history channel when they actually aired history stuffnot some crappy reality show,2
i remember when the history channel had shows about history i miss that,0
this programme inspired me to go to greece for the first time i saw athens nauplion epidaurus mycenae and delphoi it was wonderful greece like the other countries that i visited during my eurotrip made me appreciate the greatness of western civilisation and encouraged me to defend it,2
one of my all time favorites shows along with modern marvels from a long gone era in the history of history channel shame it went downhill with all their reality programming alien conspiracies pawn and swamp idiots,0
phew glad to have this one finally finished im finally off to ireland next week for a much anticipated journey into the islands incredible history as well as insights into my own family history of course many videos will follow video wise there are so many ridiculously epic projects in the works this one on akkad is a mere taste of what is to come in terms of the bronze age world dont forget to subscribe if you enjoy the content and leave a comment telling me what youd like to see covered next it all helps the algorithm gods to help the channel thanks all see you on the next one right back to work,2
putting up the name cards whenever you mention or remention people or say he is an underrated genius move it s so easy to keep track thanks to it wish other documentaries would do that,2
the fact that you have singlehandedly researched recorded edited and produced this documentary is astounding i happen to know the amount of work thats involved in something like that usually its a team of a handful or even tens of people,2
another outstanding production this is the sort of thing that should be promoted on youtube not the rubbish that always seems to get all the views what you accomplish virtually singlehandedly is astounding putting to shame projects with large crews and budgets take a long vacation youve more than earned one for the massive effort this took,2
i really appreciate these documentaries i never had the money for college so i feel like i m actually still learning something when i watch them,2
the sumerians were beautiful artisans i ve seen queen puabi s artifacts at an exhibit in the penn museum in philadelphia pennsylvania and they really stuck with me before you said puabi s name i already felt the footage you were showing looked familiar that doesn t happen to me too often with historical societies and i go to a lot of anthropological museums really a testament to how strong of an impression seeing their crafts will leave on you i really recommend anyone who is able to go visit the penn museum the exhibit on queen puabi and her people is pretty extensive the jewelry especially is so ornate and finely smithed it s amazing to think how long ago people were already incredibly skilled in making beautiful things,2
hey pete we really appreciate the amazing writing and hard work you put into these epic videos thank you for all of the great stuff to watch,2
an excellent and well narrated documentary not detailed enough to confuse the average person yet broader in interpretation than far too many other works a very good balance,2
this was amazing sumer has always been a topic of study for me and has held my interest for years because of the people of sumer and the akkadians i have a deeper understanding of biblical text from the legend of gilgamesh to ishtar a people rich in an ancient history predating eqypt brilliant work on this my friend thx again,2
the way you narrate your videos is captivating it makes the stories come alive i wish my history teachers when i was in school would have taught the way you tell these stories good job pete,2
seeing the pictures of the children brought tears to my eyes,0
thanks for the new upload you always have new pictures from the wars i havent seen yet and some that i havent seen an explanation of im very glad i subscribed to your channel,2
this is a great channel greatings from croatia,2
we need to see what man can do to man children who were viewed as mentally deficient were wiped out by the nazi regime among others who didnt fit an aryan profile it happened then and can happen again so many atrocities still go on to this day,0
you have to talk when you show the pictures,1
animals wouldnt do these horrible things to each other,0
great episode i sure that you can do a follow up episode i would like to see the ship reconstructed,2
i just love history discovering this channel has brought me much enjoyment thank you,2
this guys channeling his inner indiana jones to perfection,2
i wouldn t know what to do without youtube documentarieshistory shows etc i listen when i can t watch at work and at night i ll watch before bed,2
thank you so much for uploading this video it is helping me get through the pandemic,2
his ledger also notes that his real treasure lay in a location known only to him and the devil,1
when the history youtube channel posts more history content than it s televised counterpart,1
nice but you did not touch on the fact that troy wilusa had allies one the hitite empire they found a bunch of clay tablets writings between the two governments asking for military help from an ally,1
i love it when hoovie shows the car cleaned up in the same video,2
ever wonder just how accurate the experts are in telling us what happened i mean these are the same experts who also said troy was a myth and didnt actually exist yet some crack pot proved them wrong a rather normal situation where experts do everything they can to disprove anyone who tries to disprove what those experts built their lives upon still think more appropriate title would be myth vs evidence based guess still history is captivating and gives us a peek into what may have happened in the past as well as how civilization continues to repeat history,1
the way he ran away from him in the beginning is how i run away from my responsibilities,1
who elses sleep schedule got ruined my history bls,0
i am reborn after years later the untamed feels but its years gap,1
history stay away from me history obsessed history right or wrong history my hero history crossing the line my favourite history dramas in that order,1
lets not talk about how much ive rewatched this series,2
i m getting married top anime betrayals,0
yi chen how does he knows its me he doesnt know my hand writing also yi chen wrote a whole paragraph about who he is and how hes been peeking at him forever,1
those first couple minutes made me feel like i jumped into the koolaid without knowing the flavor then they kissed and i was oooooh ok were lemonade mixed with saddness and betrayal,0
its so interesting to see the progression of all the history series the production values and stories just kept getting better and better over these past several years i am currently watching history but season history remains my all time favoriteso emotional,2
the way he ran from him in the beginning is how i run from my homework responsibility and my mom who is running with a sandal in her hand ready to kill me,0
i m impressed that the nature of plant roots changed so much today plant roots are considered to stabilize soil and reduce erosion i have never before heard of plants increasing erosion seems an unsound hypothesis,2
with all of the extinction events that went on im wondering if the galaxy we circulate may have some bearing upon a certain point of the galaxy could there be a time corrilation between extiction events and a certain passage point of the galaxy do galaxies suffer widespead extiction events on their solar systems when the supermassive black hole turns quazar,1
the vredefort crater in south africa is miles wide as opposed to the miles of the chicxulub crater the latter impact ended the dinosaurs million years ago vredefort was million years ago one can scarcely imagine what happened,1
excellent explanations of earth s past where we are now new rock type made of plastic says it all for modern human life,2
this is one of the most interesting documentaries i have ever viewed also one the most frightening i like the explanations of the past extinctions when not all the facts are not in it is really made clear with some educated guesses,2
why wasn t the great oxidation event included on this list the worst extinction event that killed off close to all prior anaerobic microscopic forms of life,0
at the beginning they mention the oceans stagnating but i find that troubling with the effects of the moon plate tectonics wouldn t they have had a more significant impact on the earth i get confused when our land mass was a combined continent but there s no mention of that as a factor in these earlier extinctions or are we meant to know that ourselves also there would ve been more frequent meteor impacts at that time too although they d be harder to prove but i wouldn t know i m certainly no expert on the subject i just rely on logic,0
very interesting well done,2
yeah we are most definitely going to inevitably be our own downfall we may have the tools and technology to weather some disasters but we depend so much on the infrastructures we have set up to the point where most people probably wouldnt know what to do without wifi and cellular data let alone weather catastrophic effects on our food sources and supply chains,0

an interesting footnote from history after the conference in tehran in it was decided that the allies would start delivering aid to the yugoslav partisans and that aid to the yugoslav monarchists would be stopped when after the conference one of the british members of the delegation told churchill that he had sold yugoslavia to the communists churchill asked him will you live in yugoslavia after the war the delegate replied that he wouldnt to which churchill added i wont either so why bother,1
he attempted to take british somaliland which went pretty well he then attempted to take egypt which went less well then he attempted to take greece which went really badly churchill began to describe italy as europe s soft underbelly,0
my grandmother was born in she was the youngest of five children the village where she was born was located in communist controlled territory so the eamelas forces would regularly interrogate locals in case of any anticommunist activity her father decided it was best to stay neutral and simply cooperate with the communists then some guy in the village who had some dispute with him framed him for anticommunist activity the whole family my grandmother being just a few months old was transported to a prison camp set up by the eamelas for anyone accused of opposing them there they rounded up all the men and executed them my greatgrandfather was beheaded with an axe and his body was thrown into a well soon the prisoners were liberated and they returned to their homes my grandmother grew up without a father something which still deeply affects her to this day because of that she simply dismisses anything remotely leftwing because of all the trauma caused by eamelas the greek civil war is one of the darkest pages in greek history and you can still see how it has divided us,1
the greek civil war is still an incredibly taboo topic in modern greek society so much unnecessary death atrocities and war crimes committed by both sides neither left nor right wingers really want to talk about it but the unmended scar it has left to the greek people till this day is undeniable most greeks today have or might have had a relative or family friends that will have horror stories to tell because of this war,0
whenever someone tried getting a review from sir christopher lee about his service in the war he had a clever way of dealing with it sir christopher lee can you keep a secret journalist yes yes i can sir christopher lee and so can i and then he would politely excuse himself,1
great video as usual im surprised there was no mention of the churchillstalin agreement which gave britain influence in greece after the war,1
one small thing that perhaps was worth talking about you dont mention the percentages agreement between churchill and stalin this dictated the amount of geopolitical influence the soviets and the british had over greece in the postwar period which defined greece as chiefly british in influence that lead to greek communist pleas to moscow falling on deaf ears that contributed to a divide in the kke whether to be titoist or stalinist which was important to understand their aims and how that inhibited the movement great video as always,1
im a greek and this stuff isnt even taught in school even though it affected the rest of our history in the th century thank you very much for your efforts,2
the truman doctrine was part of a speech written to garner american support for fighting communist forces in greece there was worry that there would be minimal support for fighting in greece hence why the speech was so strong but inevitably it worked a lot better than anyone had expected,2
can you imagine not having direct sunlight for a year and having no idea why even wondering if the sun would shine the same ever again terrifying,0
ad is the estimated timeframe that the krakatoa volcano experienced an extremely massive eruption that caused a column of smoke ash and debris miles high so much material was ejected into the atmosphere that it shrouded the earth causing temperature drops and ensuing human suffering krakatoa would erupt massively again around and the most recent climatechanging eruption was in the s the s eruption was estimated to be equivalent to megatons the tsar bomba was a measly megatons in comparison,0
i can t believe the way you calculated fahrenheit temperature change made it past any review a change of degrees celsius is a change of degrees fahrenheit a temperature of degrees celsius is slightly above freezing or a temperature of degrees fahrenheit,0
the sheer fact i m alive is amazing my bloodline manage to make it through some of the worst times in human history think of how many bloodlines that made it through the hundreds of centuries that will end today do to a car crash or overdose or suicide appreciate being alive work hard to make ever day matter these people in worked hard to make sure you d be here today,2
its crazy to think that we all come from the people that survived that year,1
you know i find this fact somewhat reassuring if we can survive a year like that then perhaps the human race is more resilient that we think,2
the fact this was released on the beginning of the pandemic and is now years old this horror never ends even the catastrophe mentioned here only lasted months,0
the more i learn the more i think i m being punished for being born,0
you forgot one of the worst things because little ice age sparked crop faliures it also brought the real migrations of peoples from north which is in achaeology one of the most important and devastatingfor romans parts of history it really brought a nail in the coffin for eastern roman empire,0
lets just appreciate the fact that we as a species survived through that,2
the fact that a one man team creates such high quality documentaries for free is such an underrated thing and deserves much more recognition,2
these videos are insane the effort and the knowledge is inspiring,2
pete never ceases to amaze me with his brilliant work fantastic job as always,2
i don t understand how this man hasn t been recruited to make feature films he absolutely kills it every time thank you for your factual film donations to the world,2
as always im stoked to see another impeccable documentary from you keep them coming,2
yay im excited to get this one downloaded so i can listen to it while working for the next weeks thank you for all you do history time between you and a couple other history channels is like percent of my viewing lol,2
love your vids my dad was a worldamericanenglishhistory professor listening to you knowing how much research must go into these presentations all i can say is your artistic talent fairly balances your deep love of finding the origins of modern man gorgeous work thanks so much for letting us into your world sir,2
this is by far and away the best history channel on youtube its so nice and refreshing to have a pleasant narrator and peaceful single shot backgrounds too much mass produced history docs rely on smash cuts poor reenactments cut with boring line interview answers i know a lot of work goes into these videos i appreciate your diligence and the quality with which you produce these thanks and keep them coming,2
i cant imagine the time spent researching this and writing the script your narration is wonderfully clear and concise nevermind the filming and editing watching it was a very enjoyable learning experience i look forward to part two,2
absolutely brilliant presentation that is not said lightly for i am a college professor of archeology ancient history though of a different period of time of a region far far away from the british isles if in your notes you have some information concerning the norse invasion of nw scotland by coll call and his flotilla it would be interesting a very large number of the present population of scotland trace their heritage to the coll and campbell cohorts families your facts are spot on and your presentation is nothing short of spectacular thank you very much,2
when i failed an exam my dad told me at your age alexander already conquered half of persia why aren t you,0
socrates was the teacher of plato plato was the teacher of aristotle aristotle was the teacher of alexander allegedly at the age of julius caesar was seen crying under a statue of alexander because alexander died at and had conquered the known world while julius hadnt done anything notable and was inspired by alexander to rule roman republic and finally it was due to julius caesar that that his nephew was able to create the roman empire and become the most powerful man in the world that nephew was gaius octavius who was given the title augustus meaning the revered one,1
conquer your fears i promise you you ll conquer death alexander the great,1
fun fact greeks were not christians before christ existed too many churches in this episode,1
alexander died because of back injury he carried his team so much,0
foreigner dude theres a civil war greeks yeah thats just wednesday,1
alexander built cities everywhere the most famous alexandria of egypt the furthest was alexandria eschate located in modern afghanistan eschate means the furthest in greek,1
there is nothing impossible to him who will try alexander the great,2
alexander was distantly related to achilles on the mothers side with the cousins etc it was achilles who was said to be the great grandson of zeus himself,1
although there cant be a definitive answer to this question but i just want you to remember one thing hannibal scipio caesar augustus trajan napoleon had only one thing in common they all looked up to alexander,1
happy earth day if you want to offset your carbon emissions i will personally cover the first month of your subscription at for the first people to sign up,2
imagine being the person responsible for making an entire generation dumber on average that s a sad legacy to leave behind,0
accidentally is a bit generous considering he knew the dangers and intentionally covered them up,0
this sounds like a perpetrated crime against not just humanity but all life on earth rather than just an accident a crime perpetrated by corporations not one man,0
the crime rate and lead exposure correlation absolutely blew my mind although ive got reservations its crazy how you put all sorts of info together to make such eye opening videos love it,2
you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on will now be my favorite quote it s sad how often ppl prove benjamin franklins words true he would probably be very disappointed with the ignorance and misinformation we re surrounded by,0
just as a point of order he didnt accidentally harm or kill millions of people he and others knew the consequences of their actions but was prepared for others to py the ultimate price for his pieces of silver greed is and will continue to be the downfall of mankind,0
ironic isnt it that in the long race a scientist who worked to create the nuclear bombs went to save humanity and the other working for the betterment of society would actually end up poisoning it,0
very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity but even heavier amounts of lead possibly times higher were in the average household during that same time period most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil house roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water i could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile solder usually lead tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment so you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels to blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,0
an interesting fact is that patterson was excluded from the national research council panel to investigate the danger of atmospheric lead poisoning due to political pressure the ethyl executives offered caltech sizable investments if they got rid of patterson,1
let s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative,2
siddis and their unconquerable fort of janjira is not mentioned even in indian history textbooks thanks for sharing,1
best content ever never seem to disappoint me,2
you have this amazing ability to teach inform me of at minimum one fact in every video you put out it could be about a subject thats been done but without a doubt it will have something new to me i truly enjoy you this channel,2
could be the oldest known time capsule they could have made it in a time of peace and prosperity maybe,2
the reconquista of spain ended in ad it did not happen then it took from ad the battle of tourspoitiers in sw france until to kick the invading islamic armies out,1
i always learn something new when you post,2
it is awesome to explore nyterious areas,2
thank you for mentioning the siddis they were an interesting african people who came to india as slaves with islamic invaders despite their enslaved condition some managed to rise above their station and became rulers of kingdoms in many parts of india one of the most famous siddi ruler was malik ambar,2
love the content,2
new video on billnose subscribe to new channel thanks for watching,2
there is a lot of strange items and events that usually are forgotten about thats why i like these videos as for the dighton rock you have to wonder if there was anything buried under or in the area,2
my father wrote a book about greek mythology with professor john coleman s support he certainly is an expert in his field,2
the aliens in florence just wanted to watch the game and threw out glitter as a celebration they were probably hella disappointed when they canceled the game they were just trying to turn up,0
for that rock question if people in other countries egyptians inca or aztec sites for example are able to place the rocks at actually quarry sites why cant the us find this one or the site where the quarried stones were placed so they can find more info,1
i d really like to know who recorded the black knight years ago,1
thank you i love unexplained mysteries and i love your channel,2
i love a good mystery as much as any but it really really annoys me that a lot of ppl always jump the most far out explanation however improbable or even impossible such as aliens even when there are numerous possible explanations that are both simple and commonplace but then those are the same ppl who will disregard any fact that doesnt fit their tinfoil hat theory and cherrypick usable facts they twist and change to fit them or just plain invent facts sorry if im pissing off all the conspiracy buffs but when i hear hoofbeats my first thought isnt zebras or even worse aliens,0
one of the darkest historical mysteries really do you know how many ships have been lost of the last years,0
as for the rock its placement in a river suggests one of two things that it wasnt always in the water that the river has changed course over time or perhaps increased in volume or that it could have been washed there by a megaflood from the sudden catastrophic melting of the laurentide ice sheet that covered most of canada and parts of the us during the last ice age it could even be that the markings were made by the clovis people who disappeared from the fossil record at the end of the younger dryas the ending period of the last ice age what the markings are not from though is fing aliens,1
you have no idea how much youtubers like us look up to you thanks for bringing back the incredible content we love it,2
fantastic video i noticed something around karl ix wasnt a grandchild to gustav vasa he was his son the third of vasas sons to take the throne sigismund is the grandchild from johan iiis line swedish history teacher,1
just wanted to pop in and say that i think that this video showcases a highly qualitative understanding of swedish and scandinavian history that i really wasnt expecting to see come out of a nonswedish source outside of academia very nicely done man,2
i remember how in finland we were taught of the swedish crusades in th grade and i was like what nice guys coming to save us from going to hell and approxicately years later when we discussed it more in detail i went wait a minute,1
fun fact the hanseatic league had such a big inpact on the city bergen here wrongly called bryggen bryggen is just a tiny area of the city that the local beer in bergen is to this day called hansa and there is a historical hotell placed at bryggen called the hanseatic hotell the building is from the s,1
love our viking brothers that rulled us during kyivenrus grets from ukraine,2
as a dane i find this very interesting after all as sun tzu said know thy enemy nah just kidding great video and best of wishes to my swedish neighbors,2
when you break it down trading and raiding are mostly the same thing just the currency changes in the former you get gold silver precious metals gemstones and other goods in the latter you get an axe to the skull sword to the gullet mace to the brain and other physically distressing items the vikings were essentially very motivated buyers,1
as a swede in very greatful for the time and effort you put into this video that is dedicated to us thank you very much as always this was a great video with great quality,2
serfdom never took off it never took off because it was made illegal by magnus ladul s about a centruy before this the nobles tried passing their serfs of as slaves to circumvent the law so magnus son rolled his eyes and made slavery illegal too,0
watch new episodes of history s greatest mysteries solved a history digital series here,1
when looking for the lost tribes dont expect to find them all in one place it was prophesied in deut that they would be scattered to all four corners of the earth you found some traces of them that ended up becoming the cherokee but others of them became vikings others still went to asia specifically japan and others still went into africa,1
if you want to know the truth about these artifacts and how awesome the ancient israelites came to the usa before the time of christ read the four book series by stephen m collins about the lost tribes of israel he spent over years researching this issue and had access to an ancient private library they are worth reading,2
as a geologist i would suggest having an expert in ancient hebrew writing look at photos of the stones,1
i love the work you do and these show make me imagine what we don t know could be true,2
from my ancestors folklore the lost tribes of judah dan came to north america prior to the vikings possibly on phoenician ships some of the lost tribe people went with vikings to scandinavia and denmark the iroquois the mohawk the mandan and the cherokee were said to have evolved from these lost tribes i am cherokee my family history has always been in the southeastern united states and i have hebrew israelite jew dna tribe of judah as do most cherokees,1
scott thank you for presenting information that compels people to think and challenge the status quo even though its impossible to prove any of the information you have to step back and think and consider that he may be on to something here,2
scott im becoming a skeptic of your show its interesting but not much gets solved and some of it is pretty far fetched you didnt even convince the guy at the lab on this one you do need skeptics on your show just to give a counter argument instead of people who just agree there could be logical reasons that your show is not presenting that may counter what you show,0
scott you make good entertaining shows that titillate the imagination but you are anything but objective and are always seeking the grandiose explanation you know this is seldom the case templars lost tribes bigfoot cmon dude,0
i love your videos i think you would be intrigued to hear or perhaps you are already aware that there is an ancient record that was unearthed in the s in palmyra new york that was inscribed in reformed egyptian by ancient israelites they crossed over the seas from jerusalem around bc and landed on what they described to be a narrow neck of land most likely in panama they left their records behind for us and their records spoke of jesus christ visiting them after his resurrection they multiplied their seed and spread north and south and fought many battles over the north and south american continents which were considered their new promised land thus the signs of christ written with hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate there is another record which has been discovered in panama much like the one discovered in palmyra new york it is a gold set of plates with ancient egyptian and hebrew origins as well perhaps you could examin the panama gold plates to see if they are authentic,2

about time for one of the hulk s greatest villains get an origin story of his own i d like to see more of the abomination in many forms of media again as well as a history of the leader episode be developed and released soon,1
this is great i m glad he s returningthat character deserves a come back especially since marvel is much bigger now,2
fun fact during the initial membership drafting of the avengers initiative the world security council considered releasing blonsky from the custody and get him to join the avengers the council cited blonsky as a decorated war hero and believed that havoc he caused was just selfdefense from hulk but shield objected being aware of blonskys violent and unpredictable nature thanks to the combined efforts of phil coulson jasper sitwell and tony stark thaddeus ross subsequently disapproved blonskys release so bruce banner became a potential candidate instead,1
i was honestly terrified of abomination in hulk ultimate destruction as a kid i hope they dont ruin him,0
ive always loved his design since i first discovered him hes just stuck out and now i know he can breathe underwater glad the movies gave him his iconic gills,2
i really dig the origin they gave him in the film because the military gave him something before he went powerhungry and took the risk of adding hulks blood to the mix that way the abomination thing actually makes more sense,2
rick jones becoming abomination is also probably a call back to him being abomb who was just a blue abomination with more spikes,0
its about time you did the history of the abomination since he appeared in the live action incredible hulk movie is he like the marvel version of dcs killer croc,1
the shehulk attorney at law show could be a gate for a lot of hulk characters like maybe doc samson rick jones general ross absorbing man etc,1
i love all these stories but somehow its always the sikhs that make me tear up every time i think its because the last guy died so bravely and so horribly but showed no fear and went out singing the battle hymn of his people what a punch in the feels,2
there needs to be a part to this video there are so many iconic battles that werent covered some i can think of at the top of my head include battle of shiroyama sack of rome battle of thermopylae battle of the alamo battle of rorkes drift battle of camaron battle of hill battle of wizna fall of tenochtitlan fall of constantinople,1
i and every indian alive will never forget the story of bravery of the sikhsproud to be a indian,2
a small correction he was named sait musashibo benkei and its a shame you didnt include the battle of shiroyama where the man who took a big role in modernizing the new imperial japanese army was ultimately killed with his band of samurai whom were originally at the start of the satsuma rebellion he was named saig takamori,0
if you want to learn more about the sikhs yarnhub had done a great job of animating the battle,2
in ww a dentist in the pacific was working as a surgeon when japanese soldiers attacked his position he told the wounded to retreat and he held the base until he died his body was surrounded by dead bodies of the japanese,0
love the spartans it was my main reason for wanting to join marines in my eyes i thought they had this warrior spirit thats just not seen that much in the modern era,2
infographics show needs to do a video specifically on the battle of saraghari it was an insane battle salute to the brave sikhs who chose to fight to their deaths,1
its a shame that galba became a really despicable emperor before ruling rome he was an admirable person and soldier as he along with the future emperor vespasian greatly assisted emperor claudius during the conquest of britain not to mention he was also a faithful husband as he refused to cheat on his wife with none other than agrippina the younger caligulas sister and neros mother anyway i have absolute respect for sempronius densus as he was capable to do something other centurions like sejanus macro chaerea and tigellinus couldnt protect to the end the emperor they swore allegiance instead of just stabbing him in the back,1
battle of saragrahi is needed to be covered by infographics such an inspiring and motivational last stand,2
and now on my way to become a doctor valuable education food every night nice clothes a clean house nice environment and a nice school my ancestors walked so i can run give all my respect and salute to them thank you,2
i have nothing but respect for my ancestors thank you so much for all that you have endured and i love you for that i can honestly say that im so glad that i was born in because there is no way in heaven or in hell that i would be alive as soon as when i was born into slavery id have been a dead girl a long time ago but god seemed fit for me to be born in im just glad that the world has changed today of course there is some slavery around the world still in and may god bless the rest of us that is here in this world black people we have to do better making our ancestors proud of us,2
my dad always said until everyone is free we are all slaves powerful words,1
im irish i learned all about history from my mom when i was she told all about the slave trade and the holocaust i would feel very sad that any human could do that to another human she told us never forget these atrocities because the evil people on this planet would do the same again if they got away with it,0
how amazing to hear a years old grandpa speak with such sanity and good memoryi hope he s still alive the story needs to be passed to every generation to come,2
it takes an absolute monster to treat other human beings like that,0
my great great grandmother was when she boarded a slave ship from africa and we have pictures of her in her s it wasnt that long ago and any calls to get over and forget about it is disrespectful to what they had to endure so that we could live,0
i cried literally through the whole video slavery is a subject that focuses my energy into anger and sadness but i m learning to refocus that for my good using the past to fuel my future,0
i bought my first piece of land this year and i cried this is why i grew up not realizing i would be able to even own a house i m grateful i can push my family a little further economically then my parents did and that is the gift message i want to leave behind to my kids,2
ive never watched the movie but the book years a slave was so descript and disturbing although there were times i had to put the book down i really like how it brought much more light to the tortures and horrendous practices performed by the yt man and the yt woman textbooks in high school never went into the details of physical and mental punishments all i was ever taught about was whippings beatings and a little about the rapings but there was so much more that only an inhumane brute could think of doing solomon northup described them a lot as demoniac being possessed with an evil spirit and soulless seedofesau,0
so theres been some conversations here about my use of the term viking and who it refers to i think its important to start off by saying that these videos arent made for universitylevel history buffs or the like theyre designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams alevels gcses etc since i base my videos where applicable on british teaching standards i think its important to note that that the use of the term viking and scandinavian are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level at the level of a bachelor or masters degree absolutely not that level of historical nuance isnt required here yes the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances but not here these videos arent for indepth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the viking age the people commenting that viking was not used accurately are largely correct however in the context of who this video is for it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities these videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further there are other channels if youd like indepth and dry discussions of terminology anyway i hope you all enjoyed the video,1
gorn being old died hard hitting historical analysis love the channel,2
some vikings complained the baptism they were just given wasnt as nice as the last one lmao,0
oh boy i sure love being a monk in lindosfarne at,2
i love vikings because they gave us bluetooth,2
q how did the vikings send secret messages a norse code,1
when you go in one succession from a king called bloodaxe to one called the good youre either getting better or totally screwed,1
was ruled by a man called gorm the old gorm being old died in had me laughing,1
it is always interesting to see which names get translated and which just gets anglicized harald bluetooth fx is harald bl tand originally but gets translated while harald hardr de gets changed to hardrada instead of translated to harald hard ruler,1
if theres one thing to take away from the viking age its that everyone had better nicknames,1
its almost like ancient cultures were made up of actual people who in many cases knew exactly what they were doing even if they didnt understand the mechanics behind it,1
absolute history may i make a recommendation how about a video on ancient people learning to cook,1
interesting information about how settling down created inequalities in the access to food and the dawn of big food companies but theres nothing about cooking so how did ancient people learn how to cook im still waiting to find out,1
misleading title more about transition from hunting and gathering to herding and agriculture increase from small scale fishing to industrial scale some mention of fish farming and aquaculture nothing about how people learned to cook their food,0
interesting is our cultures change a lot through the generations but food never changes much like most of the ancient greek and roman delicacies can still be found in turkish cuisine think about the first bread was a pancake baked on a fire hot stone flat bread is still made all around the world,1
read catching fire how cooking made us human for the answer to how it started and what it meant to us as a species,1
the roman cuisine had a taste for flavored wine made from cooking down red wine with figs dates raisins added sometimes thyme or rosewater the residue from this process was sometimes used defruitum a thick syrup for a chicken marinade a real delicacy back than some roman merchant had a store in palmyra making this date syrup still a product in iran and syria today,1
great video just not sure the title is really fittingsubject matter is a bit different,1
since people have been using fire and cooking food since we were hominids that is such a very long time ago i sincerely doubt we will ever learn how people learned to cook but this is still a super interesting video,2
i was wondering to myself last week while cooking thank you,2

i live in volgogradstalingrad all the veterans i saw said that this battle was a real hell when the asphalt is repaired or the pipeline is replaced the remains of soldiers are still found in the ground and years have passed,0
my ukrainian gran fought at stalingrad on the soviet side she had to decode messages to be sent to headquarters in moscow whilst in service she personally witnessed the surrender of general von paulus she also told me that most of the prisoners she saw there were romanians and italians as opposed to germans god bless her soul she left us back in and would be next august,1
one of the soviet veterans of stalingrad was vladimir pikalov the general that in drove a truck up to the chernobyl reactor to measure the radiation level and survived into old age,1
stalingrad is the embodiment of i m not trapped in here with you you re trapped in here with me,1
in germany right next to where i live around m from my house there is a small farm with a rather large chapel next to it the story behind that chapel is that the old farmer who used to live there built it in order to keep a promise he made to god he was in the battle of stalingrad survived got captured and shipped to siberia while there he promised god that if he made it out alive he would erect a chapel in his honor he died around years ago very kind man and a good friend of my family but you could tell that these experiences left their mark on him as one of his main topics of conversation was always about food where to get the best bread who in our village made the best cake etc,1
the germans really did hand the soviets a beachhead fortress in this city with all the bombed rubble it only became more of a nightmare to advance into,0
a couple of my distant german family members were at stalingrad and are still there as far as i know none of the family know when or where they died exactly but there are oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial i only learnt this while looking through family history trying to learn more about my roots they were barely in their s conscripted and sent to fight im now older than they were and i couldnt imagine going through that sort of living hell i understand they were on the wrong side and i absolutely respect the russians for defending their homeland but whenever i hear the word stalingrad it makes me think of those guys war is a waste so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power,0
thank you for mentioning the real reason behind the order so many people think it was just a cruel note allowing kgb monsters to shoot soldier at whim but please do stop addressing soviets as russians there were soldiers of many nations in the red army and they do not deserve to be forgotten,0
my grandfather fought on the german side from the beginning to the bitter end of this battle then spent months working inside a gulag as a miner finally escaping few days before his unit was signed for execution he never wanted to talk much about the war only few stories about his comrades and struggle for survival i guess he felt ashamed for all the suffering nazis brought to this world i remember the day i asked him about it he didnt say anything my grandmother took me on a side and told me to never ask him about a stalingrad,0

any entertainment channel you watch will never tell you any of the real bad stuff they are doing they will give you some small nuggets of truth but never tell you whats really going on,0
the information we get through public domain is channelized and censored so that people should never know about them it is just laughable to allow a tv show to sell all your secrets so whatever they share you cannot really tell whether it is the whole truth or just an explanation to keep you away from too much of thinking i appreciate the concept of the show and it is binge worthy that is for sure but it cannot be honest,0
i remember reading an article about an apartment building that kept making people sick and they suspected mold but couldnt find any it turned out that the air conditioning ducts were making a high pitch frequency sound that was making people sick,0
i guess im a true conspiracy theorist because i dont think anyone that would actually know if any of these things existed would tell the truth and those that dont know for sure are only expressing an opinion,0
you guys are hilarious thanks for clearing all those situations up in the favor of the us gov t doing no wrong in any scenario lol,2
we live in northern california took a ride through the destruction no doubt about it ive seen what napalm can do and it burns at where aluminum melts there were many trees standing in untouched by the flames and right next to it was a vehicle whose aluminum wheels melted down the driveway yeah right no doubt about it,0
ive been a shortwave listener and ham radio operator many years number stations are a practical way of sending coded messages to agents throughout the world if an agent enters a foreign country its not hard to purchase a shortwave radio set up a long piece of wire and tune in a frequency at a preplanned utc time the agent has the key hears and writes down the numbers breaks the code with the key and destroys the message back in number stations were going crazy across all bands day and night something was going on,1
i love how after all the investigation no conclusion is reached,2
i am years old and as a kid i always thought that buzzing was coming from the tubes that ran the radio who would have thought i can say that has been going on a long long time,1
i think the worst year to be born is you would of been involved in two world wars spanish influenza and the great depression all before you turn,0
ive always gotten a little confused when people classified as the worst year to be alive in there are so many past years that didnt have as much technology to go off of like we did during the pandemic like at least we had stuff to do locked in our homes,0
no matter how bad things seem now remains one of the best times to have ever lived on earth even simple things like being able to poop in a toilet wash your hands roof over your head no concern for your life or next meal is an absolute luxury in comparison to all the generations before us,2
as an indian it was heart wrenching to watch what happened to the native american tribes of america my heart goes out to the survivors,0
in i had depression i felt as if the world was ending and everyone was just so cruel i lost my will to live i wish i had this video then people in history wouldve done anything to live as peacefully as we do today watching this video helped me feel genuinely thankful that i was born in this time period thank you for this video for once i actually feel lucky to be alive,2
wouldn t have been so bad if everyone had respect for one another,1
though reminding ourselves of the horrific times in the past might console us to get through this pandemic you cant deny that the definition of catastrophic is different for everyone the inequalities are huge the rosy picture you showed is probably in developed nations people have lost jobs lives dignity even democracies each time period has its own set of limitations and challenges ours is different,0
the fact that we enjoy watching these historical videos and also understand them better than at school is amazing,2
everyones understandind of the situation is relative to their own subjective experience it is unfair to make comparisons bewtween the past and the present without taking into account all the different variables which is practically impossible its like electricity going out and you saying you think thats bad ackchually humans lived without electricity for thousands of yeears of course thats a ridiculous statement because humans in the past were not nearly as dependent on electricity as we are now and even though it may not have been important to them to us no electricity for just a month could mean the dissolution of the world as we know it so please dont make ignorant comparisons between the present and the past as if things were indeed that simple,0
you know im glad i live in the here and now when i was i got a very aggressive case of scoliosis that would have killed me the very year id gotten it if i hadnt had major surgery i hate to imagine just how many people have died from this condition and many others throughout history,0
am i the only one or does anyone else enjoy how he dives straight into his content no preamble no monologue almost instant startup,2
a few weeks ago i driving my car and decided to listen to a classical cd i had in my car in the player it was beethovens th i listened for a few minutes and decided to go to the radio instead so i pressed the radio button but it didnt seem to work because it was still beethovens th after several minutes of punching that button i discovered that it had worked perfectly the radio and the cd were both playing beethovens th but the part that stunned me most was that they were at the very same place in the piece i could shift back and forth and not miss a thing freaky,2
this is a little less crazy then some other people but me and one of my closest friends met in the th grade one weekend we both were going to our grandparents houses and we found out that way that we were only a half a street away from each other another crazy aspect was that my mother and her father had both grown up in those houses and had attended the same elementary middle and high school exactly years apart he had also seen my mothers house being built kind of crazy,2
i had a weird thing happening to me i met a boy near a swimming pool and he said that his parents wanted to go to a random place in italy years later i saw him again at that random place in italy,1
my grandparents both immigrated from ireland separately and had met and married in the usa they discovered that they were both from cork ireland they then discovered that they had grown up a street apart but had never met,1
i learned more about history here than my hour worth of history class,2
there are a couple of other big names that died at pretty crazy was fun to watch great video,2
a guy i used to know at school got hit by the same car in the same place twice almost exactly years apart,0
when i was growing up we lived next to a farm the farmer that lived there had a unique ability to find four leaf clovers and not just four leaf clovers he also found five six and seven leaf clovers he pressed and framed about ten of them and presented it to my parents once it was weird,2
this corona quarantine has me literally watching anything youtube recommends,1
my respect for infographics channel just skyrocketed this was so well researched and heartbreaking af please dont cave to any pressure to remove it,2
all the things being told in this video are so true because most of them are real experiences of my parents and grandparents and great grandparents such a valuable video and great work,2
my grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in dongguan which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past years in the guangdong province her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind she says that before her farm was confiscated by the ccp her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth but they really didnt have a choice in the matter there would always be distant relatives and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go had no money and were starving my grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide at some point she housed and fed more than of them for many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to hong kong which was free from the troubles of china at the time many had heard of the prosperity that the british colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter hong kong when the government at the time announced they were issuing id cards for citizenship albeit his heart still belongs to china as the indoctrination that generation was subject to to them was really profound he would often complain to his children why do all of you not love china and they would retort if you love china so much what are you doing in hong kong to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer i asked my grandmother once do you think mao zedong is good and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation yes yes hes wonderful and started blurting out the first few phrases of the chinese national anthem in song i guess its why that generation is called the lost generation,0
i love how honest you guys are very brave to point this history out you guys really are the best,2
if you would like more information about what happened to families during this time a great book to read would be red scarf girl the author actually lived through the cultural revolution and the book is a retelling of what she lived through my english teacher actually made a unit covering the cultural revolution he went very indepth and explain a lot of what happened he also had us do an essay comparing mao and a dictator of our own choice it was very informative and i believe that more people should be taught about this dark side of history,2
thanks for this brutally honest video i hope this content doesnt get cancelled,2
thank you for covering this awful chapter of human history these stories must be told,1
it shocks me how this man manage to surpass the death toll of ww with the great leap forward,0
your guys content output is very impressive always quality dialog and animations you guys earn every sub youve got through intellectual educational content,2
thank you for having the courage to speak the truth this is really a great channel hope you dont get demonitized,2
download rise of kingdoms and enjoy the great egypt civilization mobile pc use bonus code rokegypt to get incredible gifts,2
fun note in british general edmund allenby found himself in the same situation as thutmose iii and having read breasteds translation of the story tried the exact same middle path trick as thutmose and it worked again years later,2
fun fact megiddo was written and directed by the ancient egyptian scribe makiel um bey it starred brucyek wilsah and with music by aerosmith because steven tyler is that old,1
glad to finally see this ancient battle get it s time in the spotlight and hope in the future to see more bronze age videos from this channel,2
hey guys i m the lead animator of this miniseries and i just want to give a shoutout to my friend historywithcy for helping us with the research and script writing for those who are hungry for more bronze agerelated content especially the egyptian dynasties i highly recommended to tune in to his channel for more insight best wishes,2
fun fact the word armaggedon came from the name of the city of meggido being designated as the location in which the battle that would condemn humanity to continually destruct itself took place,1
i am so jazzed that the bronze age is getting more attention these days when i was growing up it was completely glossed over in media and they skipped immediately to alexander and to rome but the period of civilization before the bronze age collapse is larger than the period of time that followed and it shouldnt be disregarded as just some primitive footnote in history,1
thutmose iii is one of the most interesting figures of the bronze age he spent about as much time on military campaigns as any leader you can think of and he was typically quite successful,2
thutmose iii was a child when his father thutmose ii died in bc his stepmother and aunt hatshepsut became regent during his minority but was herself declared pharaoh within a couple of years although thutmose iii was not deposed he would remain powerless during hatshepsuts reign in theory he and his stepmother were corulers but in practice his position was nebulous and he was kept out of the way as hatshepsut ruled egypt thutmose iii was also married to hatshepsuts daughter to further consolidate his claim to the throne its believed that thutmose iii resented hatshepsut for sidelining him in the first years of his reign and after hatshepsut died indulged himself in a bit spite that was aimed at his stepmother when he tore down her statues and removed her images from temples and other important structures thutmose iii was considered very studious and he studied a lot during his aunts tenure as pharaoh and he became widely respected for his learning at this time he also gained renown as commander of the army and made a name for himself as a good general who was also wise in victory all the while egypt under hatshepsut experienced a period of growth and security which the nation needed trade routes were reestablished and the economy grew by leaps and bounds this was the beginning of the wealth for which egypt is now famous for,1
i always thought that the battle of kadesh was the first recorded battle in history until today always a pleasure learning new things,2
im not a religious person but if the anti christ actually does exist then id rather fight on the side of good id rather die a good man rather than die an evil man good always defeats evil,1
his writings are fascinating he writes in a very vague and distorted way interpretation is varied and suggestive half of me believes somewhat the other not so much one thing you cant deny hes gotten the attention of millions and were still discussing him,2
meanwhile stalin is over here like what do i have to do to make this fing list,0
the bible says there are many antichrists and the last one has very great power so no nostradamus is not the only prophecy that has multiple antichrists,1
someone stated a prophecy is only useful if it is clear enough for us to take action and prevent some harm or gain some favor i like that nostradamus prophecies didnt help us prevent hitler,0
the one gentleman said that nostradamus is unique in prophesying three antichrists and that religions have one but even the bible tells of more than one in john dear children this is the last hour and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come this is how we know it is the last hour,1
it s almost as of they re conditioning the masses to prepare for something,0
the spirit of the antichrist is always among us,1
also theres no way hitler wasnt of the antichrists his sins are unforgiveable,0
im surpised they actually got the greek definition right instead of christ or cristos but then seconds later they get it wrong about the devils son its the devil defacto,0
nellie bly actually wrote her experience being in a mental hospital when she faked insanity and the book is called days in a madhouse i suggest anyone read it its tragic but if it werent for her faking insanity and witnessing what she did it wouldnt have changed the course of mental health care like it did when her story got out they also made it into a movie thats here on youtube,0
sounds like a great way to develop ptsd anxiety and panic disorders youll end up with issues if you didnt start with one,0
imagine being depressed and suicidal then you end up in a prison where you re tortured and beat daily because of it how were people actually this dumb lol,0
it s scary to think if i were born just years ago i d be institutionalized permanently for the illnesses that i have,0
my evil grandmother threw my aunt into an institution when she was a kid my aunt didn t have a mental illness my grandmother was just abusive and cruel,0
while i wish i could experience life in the past i always realize i d die within the first minutes,0
as someone with adhd im just happy i wasnt alive in those times i have a feeling that i might have ended up in one just because i was hard to handle at school seeing how i had a teacher throw an eraser at me in kindergarten while i still think we have a long way to go to be able to not make mental illness so taboo we have also come a long way but im worried well step backward if were not careful,0
when i was in the pyschward for days i just stayed in my room the entire time it just basically felt like a hospital that you werent allowed to leave screaming at night yes patients standing in the corner for hours without moving some would randomly start urinating while walking the hallsince we were all nude under the hospital gown the room i was first placed in was at the end of the hall quiet big and i was alone but after days i was put in a room half the size with other people and one of them would go hours saying she knows over and over and over again until the sun would set let me tell you you have to have a strong brain to get yourself out without succumbing to lasting mental damage,1
alot of these crazy patients were undiagnosed with autism and other developmental related disorders fortunately behavior analyst came it and took care of the unwanted insane people it really is a sad story how these doctors would not want to treat any of them,0
my sis got sent to a mental facility one time when she had a breakdown one of the employees there made fun of the cuts on her arms in addition to this another person there got a hold of a razor and slit her wrists and everyone had to witness they were treated just as much like prisoners then as previous asylums our system hasn t changed much at all unfortunately,0
yes it seems like the line between law enforcement criminality and vigilantism was extremely thin,0
you guys should do a video about the historical lone ranger the guy was a stone cold badass,2
suggestion what was life like on an early california rancho also how did things change in spains north america colonies when mexico took them over,1
as one vigilante once remarked when you want to hang a man one reason is as good as another,1
well just yesterday we had a brawl involving people in broad daylight and infront of the police station and today one guy was shot in the back and we had a hit and run just before i saw your video i was saying to myself its becoming like the wild west lately yup theres been an upscale of violence,0
speaking of lawmen who turned to crime henry plummer was sheriff of bannack montana for around a year and led a band of road agents called the innocents,1
in chance of becoming a homicide victim in the us is not even close to correct how was that recorded and no one thought hmm that seems high first two things you will find when you google is chances of being murdered in united states in any given year is about in in specifically there was about fatalities per every people,0
id like to hear about the time period involving gaius augustus caesar from about the battle of actium to about the next years and how he went from princeps to augustus and ushered in the roman empire,1
im in durango co and the wild west history here is very real having moved from alaska it is a really cool aspect of the town as for your parting question i dont know how id fare in the wild west ive played a good amount of red dead redemption so i might be okay har har but its crazy to think that my ancestors made it through this period,2
im native american apache and my great grandma born in would tell me of what her parents grandparents aunties uncles etcwould tell her and what she remembered of the old west amazing stuff,2
perhaps you folks should consider changing the name of this vid to not really much about prehistoric peoples cave paintings,1
yeah i believe this augustus guy came with a rule book a new law prohibiting bro power because two of his youthful male servants where conspiring against him that of his old age the boys where untouchable a common problem with bro power augustus can be the only one ruler and most powerful,1
why do people write we do people paint why do people do anything its for the same reasons today,0
absolute history prehistoric people paint art in cave paintings appreciate your videos listening from mass usa tyvm,2
love this stuff,2
i dont know why scientists have not done dna testing on such art works it is obvious that they used saliva to mix the pigments to make their paintings,0
i take deep exception with the image of ozzy osborne being used as an example of celebrity not known for what they do ozzy is a veritable treasure and god of music how dare you right after the kardashians really wtf,0
because the coloring book hadnt been invented yet,1
expression through art and a need for more eg money property life after death etc is hard wired in human dna,1
humans by nature are creative try again,2
umm i think somebody forgot king leopold ll of belgium the man bled the congo so badly that once it gained independence nobody remembered how to farm crops let alone run a country,0
you have to look at actual history before judging a leader evil vlad tepes was retaliating for what was done to his country he is rightly judged a hero,1
in the case of king john ive always found it funny that he was so bad at his job that an entire country had to completely restructure their government because of him,0
king john had the magna carta annulled just a few days after he signed it its importance was not emphasized until at least or so centuries after his death,1
there were atrocious kings but a lot of atrocities amongst commoners too,0
you all should probably research vlad the impaler a bit more while he was definitely a brutal ruler he was also considered to be an excellent one a military genius and romanian hero,2
you put our national hero vlad tepes on your stupid list of evil kings vlad was a hero who fought for his people and country against the ottoman empire he was betrayed by the nobles and spend years in prison in modern day hungary yes his methods were cruel but he never punished innocent people,0
just because the nobles hated vlad dont mean everyone hated him bael just means lord and he wasnt an evil god,1
your take on the habsburgs is wildly inaccurate they didnt rule over the holy roman empire they reigned due to the hundreds of independent principalities marquisates archbishoprics free cities and electors not even the emperor charles v could break this political logjam the later empire was enlightened by current european standards and im not saying this because im a fan of theirs im not but lets be accurate shall we,0
im hungarian i can assure you atilla is only seen as evil by those that are not hungarian horrible acts were made on both sides but his people had no home thanks to him now we do,0

important for people not to fake etufo stuff because it makes real ones seem fake,0
i really wish people would stop hoaxing this stuff that s why people have such trouble taking this topic seriously,0
mom and grandma had an experience in the s with a bright led circle as she explained the size of the home mom said it shot bright lights on them for a minute or so and shot off like a bullet without any sound the next day grandma led us to the field behind the house with a huge round burnt spot,1
good show i used to listen to coast to coast radio and head a eye witness explain that the grey appeared right in front of him while walk through long park alone in seattle washington he said the grey just stood there and grew a armor suit right out of its skin and when it covered its face it had the giant tear drop eyes always seen he said the grey had more humanoid eyes like ours until the suit covered it,2
these experts oknot an alienbut the reasons they give to prove its not an alien are ridiculous,0
ok but what happened to the rest of the footage in the first video something that easily could have been a puppet or prop being controlled from behind we dont see it go further into the room or exit back through the doorway,1
ive twice seen ufos both times with my mum bro first time in melbourne australia in was on way to school we many others saw heaps perhaps or bright tiny star looking ufos weaving in out from each other nd in adelaide oz all of us caught thru our loungeroom window at dusk a very bright spinning light which burst into a bigger light before vanishing,1
the one thing i hate about these shows and the people in them is that they state their own hypothesis or that of others but state them as fact not as what they are hypothesis opinion or at most very well educated guesses the only way to claim those cave paintings are one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt would be to talk to the actual creators of the images shame on them for lying,0
loved the host of this clip he did a great job narrating and has a solid narration voice,2
the maritime disaster that was the sinking of the titanic in lives on in memory still in the st century how remarkable is that really one of the startling facts for me is that it sank in just under three hours with a loss of people it must have been terrifying especially as it happened in the dark one of the most eerie things ive ever watched is when scientists finally found the wreck a great distance from where they thought it would be they were in a mini sub and the bulk of the ship just loomed out of the darkness it was truly weird i dont like deep water in fact terra firma for me thank you great video neil see you tomorrow,0
seeing the menu of the titanic and learning about the chefs gives us a little glimpse into such a significant historical moment thank you neil and of course the rest of the video is amazing looking forward to watching your segment tomorrow,2
i don t know about the rumor that we didn t know who boy george was at all in the us actually we all fell in love with him a true singer and flamboyant personality,2
i remember johnny ray in there s no business like show business with ethel merman dan dailey donald o conner marilyn monroe mitzi gaynor and hugh o brien i loved that movie they really knew how to make movies in those days,2
your face absolutely lights up each day when you are presenting this extra special on this day segment for us all neil i am so pleased to see that you are enjoying it as much as we are cont i enjoyed seeing and hearing about everything mentioned today and yes i will join you tomorrow thank you dear neil xx,2
i was watching a detective story from the s and found myself thinking why don t they get out their mobile phone of course i then recalled they didn t actually have them then the younger generations must really find old shows difficult to relate to much more so than we did there were far fewer significant lifestyle changes between and than between and i feel,0
now i am going to be singing karma chameleon in my sleep tonight lol,2
really love boy george such a great musician and interesting person,2
my sisters and i loved boy george and we still do he is still a star in our eyes,2
so many people who had so many dreams that died when the titanic sank such a tragedy it is fascinating reading about the titanic and the decadence on the ship one of my boys was a huge fan of boy george thanks for this review of this day,2
what parts of the standard american history myth did you believe john adams and thomas jefferson were founding fathers but they didnt attend the constitutional convention my bad,0
my th grade us history teacher announced to us that we would be taking a pop quiz that was worth of our grade and told us we had to get every answer right otherwise we failed she handed us the literacy tests and said we had minutes to complete it beside our understandable confusion as to what this had to do with history we all failed terribly thats when she came out and told us that had we been black over years ago none of us would have been able to vote in the south and told us these were the literacy tests the curriculum told her to teach us about she is still my favorite teacher to this day because she had such an amazing way of personalizing historic events to us,0
you hit the nail on the head with the feeling guilty for being white thing i think that s why so many people are afraid to open their eyes to racism because they just think well i m not gonna be guilty for being white when in reality you don t need to feel any guilt as long as you re not racist you just need to acknowledge that it s there and has been there very informative video,1
as someone who studies convict leasing in tennessee this is a great video just a couple corrections tennessee prisoners were not sent to birmingham they were leased to tennessee coal and railroad company its a little more complicated than that but we can go with that for simplicitys sake who used prisoners in their mines in tennessee after convict leasing ended in tennessee in tennessee coal and railroad moved its headquarters to birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there but those were alabama prisoners not tennessee prisoners states absolutely used convict leasing to make money the lease on the tennessee state penitentiary could not be sold for less than per year beginning in the mid s that would be over million per year in todays money selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers the idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner they would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didnt know and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal i am happy to provide archival documents for these facts if you are interested,1
as a year old who recently learned about the ww era and desegregation i could tell something was wrong but obviously didnt know what since i wasnt taught anything else this video really helped set things straight for me and you put it so clearly even a kid can understand thank you for making this video more people need to see this,2
thank you for your comprehensive analysis with included sources and narrations and wrapping it up with a call to action this is what the internet is about,2
i usually skip anything to do with slavery because as a black man it s exhausting but this was so well done and factual i watched the entire thing the fact it s done by a white male is even more satisfying because no one can claim bias or prejudice this was enjoyable and much appreciated thank you,2
thank you for your history listen as a yr old black american educated ba degree and a us veteran i was unable to express why my life goal was to live abroad im free at last im an expat in mexico,2
i feel proud of my history teacher now she wasnt afraid to dig into the good the bad and the really ugly and disgusting parts of american history she taught us about all of this i hope other history teachers end up following in her footsteps,2
this video has made my heart seethe with rage as a white young adult myself my great grandfather experienced the hardships of sharecropping and i regret every day that he is not with us for me to learn and record his experiences on an even worse level the ignorance of my grandfathers generation on the peonage system and their tendency to spout black criminality rhetoric saddens me it amazes me how racism can fester so immensely with even the most impoverished folk my thoughts and prayers go out that future generations take the important duty of learning this history in a more complete manner than mine your line delivery in this video is outstanding your passion and sincerity in your presentation of these sad facts shows just how good of a man you are bravo and may every man and woman of every nation know these and all other historical horrors for the betterment of tomorrow and beyond,0
ive never been particularly interested in john greens works but the fact that he encourages readers instead of just seeing them as beneath him says a lot about his character and his connection with his audience,1
i just found out that this john green is actually that john green,2
my literature teacher told us to come here i now understand why and that literature goes beyond being entertained by a book or for the sake of pleasure i now see reading is a tool that will help us in our lives experiences feelings good or bad ones but still feelings and so much more but it would be a very long list greetings from argentina,2
hello john id like to let you know that youve inspired me through your books to write my own ive read looking for alaska my personal favorite the fault in our stars and paper towns and ive loved each book im and im planning on starting my book this winter,2
thank you my english teacher once told my class take this edgar allen poe story and find symbols if we didnt have we were failed and the most anyone had was they then told us about the symbols we missed and none of them made any sense one was that cat represents the devil because the cat died,1
ugh i love crash course so much not only because it is educational and interesting but also because it inspires me to want to learn more,2
i know you guys are doing more cc lit but this is my favorite cc series and i have read entire novels for the sole purpose of watching two minute videos on them so it would be so amazing if you made this a more regular series because this series is what really broke the ice for me learning how to analyze books seriously cc lit has changed my life,2
showed this clip to a reading class im teaching here in the sf bay area th graders and one of the ideas that came out of the class is that imagination and empathytwo of the main skills strengthened by readingcan be antidotes to cynicism and indifference two of the really toxic aspects of the culture young people have to deal with,0
go out there and make a world best wishes john green,2
history literature and overall nerdinessi love this man,2
it saves you time it makes you nice its a cure for loneliness it prepares you for failure,2
literature is meaning escapism entertainment psychologist secret friend teacher and imaginationtrainer all rolled up into a spine pages and two covers that is literature,1
this is absolutely brilliant all teachers and students need to see this,2
literature removes boundaries allows you to read minds time travel all in the comfort of your own room it also fosters empathy and fuels imagination,2
the one thing i am really grateful for in the videos by sol is the fact that they repeatedly assert how everyone is weird and that we all pretend to be normal and acceptable believe it or not i have spent a lot of my time wondering worrying and feeling bad because i wasnt perfect i would talk to myself get completely lost in day dreams and feel empty inside now i have slowly got myself to think that it is all okay that everyone is weird and i should just embrace myself an eternal dynamic mess,2
more literaturethemed school of life videos please i can suggest writers if you like,2
it would be awesome to have a list of all the books referenced in this video thanks for this,2
this makes me want to start reading again its been too long since i really read a book basically since school back then i didnt like to be forced to read i find it difficult to get hooked and im also quite a slow reader who could give me some suggestions to give it another try,0
im reading the secret garden right now and i couldnt agree more that it is in fact the greatest reality simulator more immersive than movies even,2
watched this tonight as part of an adult education course and wante to say that this video perfectly articulates why i want to go back to education i also feel the majority of the points can be applied to all types of great art whether it be it a beautiful painting a song a movie even a comic sandman or a tv show the wire in answer to a few of the comments below the video was specifically speaking about what literature is for therefore that is the only subjectmedium it should analyse but i agree that any great art can teach us what it means to be human,2
the guy that saved him from a firing squad was clearly a time traveller,1
when i read crime and punishment i got so wrapped into it i called in sick at work to stay home and finish the book,2
pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart the really great men must i think have great sadness on earth fyodor dostoevsky crime and punishment,0
grownup people do not know that a child can give exceedingly good advice even in the most difficult case fyodor dostoyevsky the idiot,0
i want to learn russian to be able to read his original amazing novels,2
this explains why i was drawn to this mans work as a teenager the despair in accepting inevitable suffering then learning to laugh and still admire the beauty in it anyway,2
dostoevskys dead said the citizeness but somehow not very confidently i protest behemoth exclaimed hotly dostoevsky is immortal the master and margarita,1
will mark the th birthday of this legendary writer lets celebrate dostoyevsky by readingrereading more of his work and introducing it to others,2
i love mankind he said but i find to my amazement that the more i love mankind as a whole the less i love man in particular fyodor dostoyevsky the brothers karamazov,2
we want happiness but we have a special talent of making ourself miserable cdostoevsky,0
i collected many books in my private collection which described ancient or the modernity of social class many literature books and even modern varieties are ancient statue books which are resolvable when including digital funding approaches these dilemmas of history and authors still contained there made notice how fermented literature problems are there in this genre with desceptive and complicated writing most of these author problems are about lacking taxation for their publications and can all be solved with basic cultural sufficiency the only books left clearly are books of biological axiom measurement and important areas the rest is left in boring light if the hysterical problem always has the same solution you will read these admirable criticisms untill you start to complain for your justice and indicate in the ecosystem the only thing you notice is that the same countires and ecosystems require your depth and a basic sufficiency in more publications,1
it is an artistic aesthetic work that accrosses the litrery language and characterized by its owner style,2
literature is the study of human communication,1
always to the point,2
now i understand literature thanks man,2
our pain moves in an area of vast sadness we dont find paws that wipe the weights of steadfast fear off our shoulders all suspicions wake up to the sound of doubt coming from the mouths of the traitors nothing compares to the sails departing from the ports of memories have you seen with the eyes of your dreams the mirage of years in the seasons of false wish return to your deserted consciences you poets who escaped from the prison of iron despair there are flowers waiting for your words for a winter touch in the summer of burning words ali suroor,0
a really great video though i found the background music very distracting and had to watch it on mute with the captions which was disappointing,0
i dumped medical for eng lit and this is the best decision i ever made,2
criticism is not theory but this video would have students believe so,1
oh my god this is well made,2
this probably the most beautiful talk i ve heard regardless of the beautiful way of putting literature i also enjoyed listening and empathising with him it was healing as it was educational thank you,2
great talk dr luzzi nails it he really motivated me to go back to books and enjoy the world of literature his personal story is so touching and vivid the rule of fours is so interesting thank you dr luzzi,2
surprises me to see such less views on such a brilliant talk truly inspirational,2
what a beautiful talk dr luzzi truly the literature can change our lives,2
what a great teacher great speaker and strong man thankful to hear this,2
this gave me goosebumps i need a teacher like him,2
i want him to be my professor in master of arts in literature,2
what a great speaker i want to hear more from him,2
i can relate to this we were too poor to afford books i remember the joy i felt when our teacher took us to the library i couldnt believe they let me take books home things were never the same again i love this mans voice,2
what an insight towards literature in this great speech im happy to know some books and authors that he mentioned more over after watching this video most of the people willl start reading books wonderful speech v surprised to see less number of views,2
they found me onna block and throwed me in the industry,2
ola a goat his verse never flop it float,2

alone i often fall down into nothingness i must push my foot stealthily lest i should fall off the edge of the world into nothingness i have to bang my head against some hard door to call myself back to the body virginia woolf the waves,0
i strongly recommend her diaries it is the best possible novel her life written in the most beautiful but unguarded prose i go back to them every few years when i am on holiday and just want to soak up her lucid thinking and mastery of the english language,2
virginia woolf s a room of one s own inspired me to read and write there was something about her piercing words that changed my perspective about many things i m grateful for her talent sad about how much she suffered in life,2
she sounds like a genius,2
nevertheless life is pleasant life is tolerable tuesday follows monday then comes wednesday the mind grows rings the identity becomes robust pain is absorbed in growth opening and shutting shutting and opening with increasing hum and sturdiness the haste and fever of youth are drawn into service until the whole being seems to expand in and out like the mainspring of a clock how fast the stream flows from january to december we are swept on by the torrent of things grown so familiar that they cast no shadow we float we float virginia woolf the waves,2
my favourite writer and the writer that got me into reading literature,2
to the lighthouse changed my conception of what writing could achieve its one of the finest novels ive ever encountered and i entreat whomever sees this comment to read it,2
isnt there a certain irony to virginia woolf she detested the snobbery of the time she lived in and yet her books have created a new kind of snobbery in literature and academia,0
one of my favorite female writers what a woman my will to study every day more and more is definitely fruit of her legacy,2
its really amazing want on topic like how to read critically close reading or how to read the text effectively,2
the first minute of the video is almost the same explanation that was given to us by our professor in literature when i was in college the rest of it is an expansion of what i already know and at some point i came to realize that there are more things that i havent stumbled upon before in the introduction of lit thanks a lot and i hope you produce more content for both language and literature subjects,2
great youve regarded the subject from multiple different angles which help us get acquainted with the ins and outs of the topic but there are intrinsic and extrinsic factors to be taken for granted to decide which texts are literature,2
if you enjoyed the video please let us know by hitting the like button asking a question or sharing your thoughts on these definitions of literature in the comments section thanks for watching everybody,2
your videos are really what makes things interesting and understandable can we expect one on literary periods pls,2
i so appreciated this video because as a literary multigenre novelist ive been feeling like the odd man out ive been told that my work will be appreciated after im dead but that gives me little comfort however its good to know that there really is no consensus on what constitutes literature good or otherwise subscribed,2
for some reason watching this video made me think of the issues brought up in dave hickeys book air guitar essays on art and democracy,1
thank you so much for this excellent video all the best,2
carefully explained,1
really enjoyed,2
joyces style is more relevant today than ever considering the choppy abbreviated and polluted thoughts we all experience in such an overstimulating and informational existence,2
when i die dublin will be written in my heart thank you james joyce,2
i try reading ulysses every now and then to deflate my mr knowitall attitude the ultimate leash for my intellectual pride,1
in this beautiful attempt at explaining what art is made for this video becomes poetry itself thank you so much for this,2
do one on fernando pessoa please he is a genius,2
my favourite story about james joyce when joyce and drinking buddy ernest hemingway faced a potential brawl joyce would hide behind his more imposing comrade and shout deal with him hemingway deal with him,1
and here comes the voice that can calm my nerves just what i needed today thanks for todays lesson school of lifebest regards from your humble student,2
utterly baffling to a reader in a hurry well said,0
finally an irish writer you should look into doing wilde or beckett next,2
if you have read ulysses then im impressed that has got to be the most difficult book in the english language except for finnegans wake of course,1
we judge young girls for what they are but young boys for what they promise to be goethe,1
fun fact after the release of the book the sorrows of the young werther this has caused a chain reaction of suicides in europe this cause of suicide effects has been later called as the werthereffect,0
a man should hear a little music read a little poetry and see a fine picture every day of his life in order that worldly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful which god has implanted in the human soul johann wolfgang von goethe,2
this is the only channel on which i am actually enthusiastic to read peoples comments and input much respect to all the thinkers out here thank you school of life for this piece of art in itself,2
this guy wrote a story in different languages when he was,1
i just love the amount of skill and effort put into the visuals and the theory all the same so much research in both areas,2
the sorrows of young werther is a fabulous book despite the tragicromantic style it is not only based on goethes own disappointing experiences with women but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him im no expert on goethe but i also understand he completed the colour wheel which isaac newton started it is important to understand that in goethes time there was a romantic movement nothing to do with the definition of the word today but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late th c called sturm und drang storm and stress a small group including schiller of angry young men who embraced the ideals of the romantic movement by the way if you havent done a video on the romantic movement please do the romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment such as science and rationalism and its clinical dry detached way of categorising humanity and the world the romantics were not an organised group as such one of the best descriptions of the romantics was written by my old philosophy teacher the declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of culture and rationality which barred the way both historically and personally to a return to nature this is nature the unbounded wild and everchanging nature the sublime and powerful were humans to behave naturally freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed and humans could live a nobler life in the name of nature the romantics worshipped liberty power love violence imagination irrationality the greeks the primitives or anything that aroused their emotional responses while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves,1
it is a damn shame that you can only put one thumbs up under this video those kind of videos are what makes the school of life one of the best channels on here,2
i am from latin america and i could say that this channel is one of my fav in all internet i hope someday explain about borges cortazar poe etc cheers,2

magee always manages to frame his questions with great clarity but without condescending to the putative audience who are assumed to be reasonably intelligent and educated,2
thank you dame iris murdoch for everything,2
she suddenly comes alive on art and the moral always brilliant,2
i cannot imagine any television networks making these sort of programs these days it is rather depressing because s is rather recent for some of us at that time we were worried about dumbing down of culture yet there were still plenty of high brow culture covered by main stream media in retrospect s may have been the last era in which high culture would have any part to play in television,0
im reading a book called existentialists and mystics writings on philosophy and literature by iris murdoch edited by peter conradi which has in it what purports to be a transcript of this interview with bryan magee but the sentences are different many words are added or deleted or changed its almost as if someone decided that the actual interview wasnt polished or eloquent enough and the editors made changes or is it possible that iris murdoch got the transcript and modified to her own writing standards does anyone out there know,1
great conversation thank you,2
fortunately artists don t pay too much attention to philosophers,1
a lovely conversation,2
true that most students look for rules and solutions but they should be brave and leave thoughts hanging just exposed,1
does anyone have a lovehate relationship with analyzing literature like when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion but when i try to find a meaning of something it always turns out to be wrong even though there s technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly it just doesn t make sense to me when i would get a on a analysis paper just because the teacher didn t seeanalyze what i wrote about a certain text,0
this is why i pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis much of the following is due to bad memory but everything i would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a characters situation i would get it wrong maybe i needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels essays were going through i was only a kid,0
thank you sososososo much for this video my school is crap and doesnt teach us these things but i want to be able to analyze books and ive sort of been trying to but videos like these are always a good reminder thank you,2
i disagree i have never been able to find the deeper meaning in literature however i have always enjoyed when people discuss the symbolism and meaning behind parts of books that i took at face value videos like this give me another way to think about what i am reading and they help me find the deeper meanings of a text when i read it,2
stuff is always so open to interpretation i ragequit before a few chapters trying to analyze literature it takes all the joy of reading out of me,0
some great ideas this is why i love reading and literature the human condition is so complex,2
you make it sound so simple definitely using these ideas in my classroom,2
lovely visuals and amazing lesson great way to understand storytelling,2
books belong to their readers novelist john green,1
acknowledging the insight and complexity of finding small and complex clues in a literary work seems to be a way to use in any work this is because not only foreign literary works in this way but also korean works are need to show complexity and insight to understand from now on when i see these works i will read them with a sense of complexity and insight,2
this was a great introduction to kafka thank you,2
a first sign of the beginning of understanding is a wish to die franz kafka,1
the trial was the most relatable novel i ve ever read that feeling that the world is just against you and you don t know why but yet you feel like you deserve it because you couldn t live up to the standard expectations,2
the narrator has a very good pronunciation of german wordsnames,2
this video doesnt even mention his humor which is abundant alongside the tragedy and darkness,0
boys need their fathers permission to become men school of life april deepest quote ever,1
the saddest of us are usually cursed to see the happiness that isnt there,0
the task of literature is to reconnect us with feelings that might otherwise be unbearable to study but which desperately need our attention so intense damn,0
if only literature lessons at school were so interesting,2
i cried so much kafka is filled with deepest most harmful dark inner feelings within us all i wish his father read his letter though,0
really love you emmie i m a huge classic lit nerd so this ones right up my alley thank you for your recommendations,2
charles dickens likes to write sentences longer than the mississippi river resonated so deeply with my soul like this man is one of my all time favorite authors and yet he makes my adhd brain suffer all the gd time,0
intro the broken wings by kahlil gibran the picture of dorian gray by oscar wilde pro tip the alienist by machado de assis brave new world by aldous huxley pro tip frankenstein by mary shelley giovanni s room by james baldwin the wind in the willows by kenneth grathame snow country by yasunari kawabata ethan frome by edith wharton perfume by patrick suskind,1
you re the kind of person that everyone wants as their best friend,2
i knew dorian gray would be on this list this is the book that made me realize classics could be engrossing and accessible to people today,2
so many good recommendations if i could add a few id put wuthering heights by emily bront rebecca by daphne du maurier the secret garden by frances hodgson burnett another childrens classic yay steppenwolf by herman hesse the structure can be a bit weird at first but when the story fully kicks in youre in for a ride lmao the martian chronicles or fahrenheit by ray bradbury for those who enjoy scifi pedro p ramo by juan rulfo a piece of classical mexican literature said to be the inspiration for one hundred years of solitude,2
perfume story of a murderer is one of the books that got me excited about reading in general which is both a blessing and a curse because i have yet to read a book as good as it since,2
you should definitely make videos on how you annotate your books and write your essays,2
the writing in the picture of dorian gray is so unique i remember reading the first couple of chapters and literally smelling roses and and linen it felt beautiful without luscious prose somehow,2
im actually in an english major and english is not my first language its spanish and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if its not your first language at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words also start with classical short stories like a th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine,2
though it is hinted the video should have mentioned that tolstoy was one of those few writers who was famous and received recognition in his own lifetime and not posthumously,1
every time i watch your videos about philosophy literature psychology and sociology i am left with one very unsatisfying thought there are so many books in the world that i want to read and dont feel like i will ever have the time to though im only in my early s,0
i think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself in your death bed every now and then to prepare yourself for this you must read the th chapter of the death of ivan ilyich again just a very short chapter where ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed he suddenly hears the voice of his own soul saying what do you want what do you want he says what do i want to live and not to suffer so his inner voice says to live how to live as i used to well and pleasantly as you lived before well and pleasantly here is how tolstoy continues and in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life but strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except the first recollections of childhood there in childhood there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return but the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else as soon as the period began which had produced the present ivan ilyich all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty so as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and darker he basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statushe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no way back indeed we all must keep ivan ilyich in mind every day just consider how fast the time goes by how much of it do we really spend seriously thinking about our lives very little indeed because it requires a certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time thats why this scene is a great reminder so as we make the death bed exercise i have just mentioned we can use the very questions that ivan ilyichs soul was asking him i think people who live well deal with their mortality better so doing this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better thank you for this wonderful lesson i love tolstoy,1
school of life has made my insight in philosophy so much wider,2
anna karenina and the death of ivan ilyich are among the best books ive ever read if you do read tolstoy make sure to go with the pevear and volokhonsky translations they allow you to get the most from his works,2
the most epic wtf ending of a life ever,1
this explanation of war and peace was way too brief i understand that this is just a minute video and you are just trying to give people a vague idea and a taste of the book but the way you made it out in your video it may seem like war and peace is just about natasha but the whole point of the book is that it is a huge epic story with so many characters whose lives are all intertwined,1
his life is so wholesome and laddish at the same time from being a drunk gambling layabout pestering gypsy women then getting bored and becoming an officer to penning literary masterpieces about inner kindness and understanding then just walking out on your family and dying of pneumonia absolute madman,0
my all time favorite writer an entire school of life episode could be dedicated to tolstoys short stories strider god sees the truth but waits what men live by master and man the wood felling sevastopol ive read all those stories times and hope to read them more james joyce once said that tolstoys how much land does a man need is the greatest short story ever written,2
why arent we seeing film like this before call me old fashion but we need to introduce the public to these classics again we need another renaissance soon,1

laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion jane austen my absolute favorite and it never gets old,2
i m happy that you said that our degrees should be seen as hobbies because not everything has to be something career driven and that s something that s moved me back into my love for english and writing and i m so thankful,2
not gonna lie your tiktoks and videos reignited my love for literature so much more than i already did the way you talk about it really comes through it made me remember why i love literature so much in the first place,2
you literally exude elegance i adore you and your energy,2
i love literature ive loved it for as long as i can remember however i grew up dirt poor and seeing the way my parents who both worked day and night struggled to provide for us and meet ends meet gives me a pretty innate fear of falling into poverty as an adult i want to provide for my parents and i want to be able to provide abundously for a kid if i had one i am lucky enough to have received grants for college and as much as ait hurts i dont intend to waste it on a major like english thats kinda just how it is wish the world was different not everybody has that luxury,2
this video arrived at the most opportune moment i started off college im currently a sophomore with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture before starting college i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study even most of my cousins have studied something stem science tech engineering and math related while i did ok in my first semesters i felt really depressed and suffocated my mental health was at its lowest it was a terrible time for me i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse a week ago i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors from biochem to english let me tell you i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major,0
i majored in biology with minors in chemistry and philosophy always loved reading and sometimes i wish i majored in english i want to start writing soon but i just need to find the time outside of my scientific career lol like you i ve always seen myself as a bibliophile but was frequently discouraged from studying the arts i kept reading and i now have a small personal library i love the feeling of just thinking and getting lost in a book dissecting the words and the scenes they provoke in my mind you brought up some good points and relatable experiences thank you,2
i ve always had a passion for reading and writing since i was little my older cousin who helped me fuel it would always tell me that i d make an amazing author i don t know if i have the talent tbh but it s something i ve dreamed of doing forver but i m torn between what i wanna do right now it kinda sucks and finally i love you too dakota,2
as an artistwriter myself it has always been a hobby of mine and now i want to turn it into a fulltime passionjob but i am currently in college with my psychology degree because being an empath is also comes natural to me and i want to help people so i have a lot planned for the future and hopefully i ll have a work published in less than a year and a half,2
this genuinely assisted me in attempting to find my passion in itself thank you,2
this is for those who arent in a very privileged situation and want to take literature and writing i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to stem courses and careers my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition but luckily for me my parents support me i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesnt have a lot of opportunities for writers too but i know this is the path i want to take o want to work with books so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career i would be happy for myself and my family to those in a similar position as me my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision i dont regret my choice,0
jane austen also teaches us not to be to tough on introverts they turn out to be her most worthy characters,2

these videos have opened my eyes to the beauty of philosophy and literature its such a comforting feeling to learn that the questions and often sad thoughts in my head have been thought of and so thoroughly worked on by these great men and women in the past in the past two weeks since ive started to watch these videos i have seriously reconsidered many topics and views i have on life its a shame american core curriculum doesnt require the teaching of philosophy and reasoning if more people learned and discussed these issues it could make our societies and lives so much more fulfilling,2
can you make more videos about women please sylvia plath simone de beauvoir virginia wolf george eliot harper lee the bronte sisters etc,1
kudos to the animators of all the episodes i dont think they get nearly enough appreciation,2
yes her novels make us laugh dont forget to emphasize how witty and funny austen is,2
whats even more crazy is that jane austen wasnt formally recognized as a great writer until the s during her life people did not largely read her work and it wasnt until many decades later when a harvard scholar wrote a seminal paper on her work did she finally get attention,0
j austen pride and prejudice is the first novel i read when i learned english i still found it difficult but beautiful as i improved i was mesmerized at her writing how well she could work on the carachters thank you for making a video of her life she was amazing writer,2
as a writer shes my inspiration and im not a professional writer but i do love writing,2
school of life is one of the most humanistic channel on youtube,2
i could have listened to more than an hour on this subject alone victorian literature is an enormously broad topic with writers as diverse as emily bronte and joseph conrad id love to see you do a more expanded version,2
excellent video i appreciate all your researchthe victorian era is very fascinating to me i especially like the mystery or adventure books of the era my favorite are doyle stevenson verne melville wilkie collins and kipling though not his more imperialist stuff does anyone have any more classic victorian adventure authors or stories i should try out,2
i know this video is about literature but i cannot stop admiring the artwork,2
thank you for a great introduction to victorian literature i am especially impressed by how youve also highlighted other aspects of victorian culture especially its art,2
dickens is without a doubt the greatest writer ever,2
i was admiring your writing skills the whole time everything just flowed so naturally i would kill to be able to write like that thank you so much,2
super helpful i loved the way you presented the information it kept me interested the whole way through,2
really fascinating the british empire having a billion inhabitants in the s thats getting awfully close to modern demographics though with the important difference being that modern population numbers rose naturally and are actually maintainable,2
thank you for citing your sources wonderful work,2
thank you for this nicely done video,2
teachers should show this to students everywhere this channel is a treasure,2
charles dickens had what is called the beatles factor his writing could appeal to both the smartest and the dumbest person in the room like the music of the beatles,1
i dont think that dickens shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional spiritual and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood while he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art quite an achievement he wasnt able to heal emotionally its usually easier to deal with such things in abstract intellectual and artistic ways he was in many ways driven by his demons and that can surprisingly take you very far in life but it doesnt make you a better person in fact the success may militate against real change,0
fantastic explanation of dickens appeal and what he was trying to do as a novelist,1
literature entertainment sympathy nice ordinary things,1
im reading a charles dickens book for the first time and watching this video was really impressive the strategy he adopted seems very powerful maybe we need more of this general awareness and less ready solutions at some level,2
dickenss genius was in bringing characters and physical objects to life he was not being seductive he was making us relive his experience and making people and places come to life no one will ever forget miss havishams wedding cake the character of bill sykes or mr micawber once you encounter the scenes and objects and characters of his novels you never forget them,2
it really made me sad that this person was so great and dedicated in his work but at the same time at the expense of terrible relations with his wife and children it s just so freaking sad you can never have it all can you,0
this was an amazing video i really appreciate what youre doing here,2
its just too amazing many people got inspired by charles dickens he was a great writer i would love to read his stories of that era,2
great content excellent explanation about literature i have registered for the creative writing course at college and i was looking for articles or visual content to make myself familiarize with the topic and after watching this video i can tell this video helped me to understand the very important basic foundation of fiction nonfiction drama and poetry i cannot thank you enough for sharing your knowledge with us,2
thank you very much for sharing such a beautiful fabulous and beneficial knowledge with reference to literary genres and subgenres hats off to you,2
you have an amazing ability to simplify the basics of literature much appreciation for your great job,2

i have a degree in english language and literature and i learned so much from watching this video goes to show how wonderfully unique each curriculum is xx,2
as someone who just graduated with an english and women and gender studies degree this is just what i needed you have no idea how much i miss this kind of conversation and love for books im lucky enough that all my friends are equally as nerdy about our love for literature but theres something about classes and passionate professors that i is hard to replicate enjoy it while you can,2
a tip from a once homeschooled college student who read a lot of classics read the annotated versions read the ones with context talk to people that are nerds about the historical context of the book it makes it so much more fun to know why certain weird things happen in old books,2
as a beginner to classics myself i would absolutely recommend the picture of dorian gray to just about anyone it s short quotable but also uses such accessible language,2
alice in wonderland by lewis carroll selected works of edgar allan poe carmilla the picture of dorian gray the strangeroutsider the death of ivan ilyich john fowles the collector starlight and moonshine frankenstein,1
the metamorphosis by kafka is super short easily digestible and laugh out loud funny in an absurdist sense would recommend,2
oh my god finally a booktuber who talks about the kinds of books that i like nothing wrong with ya or fantasy i just dont like it but it feels like its the vast majority of the online book community can anyone recommend me more booktube accounts like this one,1
i feel like pride and prejudice by jane austen was the perfect introduction to classics for me because i was so familiar with the plot that the language wasn t insanely difficult,2
really needed this because i have a weird relationship with classics i haven t even started frankenstein for the book club because i m genuinely scared lol,0
for people who want to try shakespeare but are intimidated by the language i always recommend the no fear shakespeare publications that have the original language on one page opposite a translation in more modern language we used them in high school when we did theatre productions to look at different interpretations of the phrases,1
the first classic i read was picture of dorian gray a while ago since then i have fallen in love with so many classics such as wuthering heights pride prejudice great gatsby etc cant wait to read some of these recs edit after some recommendations in my reply i read crime and punishment by dostoyevsky and loved it it s soo good it s a lot to take in but regardless amazing book,2
i started reading again this year i was probably only reading books a year for several years straight for a literature course i had to read persuasion by jane austen i fell in love with it and finished it in a day its also very short compared to her other novels it kickstarted my reading again and ive read books so far this year not a crazy number compared to others however thats a huge leap from only books a year,2
elaina thanks you very much,2
this anime is very good good combination of dark fun and adventure themes that also talks about the existing social and mental issues in society,2
thank you for listening and love it,2
this song is so calming and so cute i love the lyrics,2
today i prepare a huge journey because of this song this anime and kino no tabi ive already visit lisbonne barcelone rome naples cinqua terra guadeloupe martinique st lucy paris gen ve bruxelles berlin ireland greece marrakech opatija and i look forward to continue,2
this music is very beautiful and can make us imagine traveling far in a pandemic like this thank you for the music,2
i just finished this show and came straight here to listen to this amazing song again because i was so sad that the journey was over for now,2
love this openingi wish it has season,2
i love this song the lyrics is amazing good job,2
one of the best anime ive watched i love the opening its giving a quite nostalgic vibes that feels as if youre in journey as in a fairytale flying in the air imagining myself as a witch indeed this song suits this style for this anime i absolutely love elaina,2
this was really good in closing the gap of understanding between common humans and literature phds thank you for the sociological experiment,2
very amusing especially the beginning you have great sense of humour,2
hi mattia thank you so much for making the video i recently started my phd seminars so this video is very relatable i noticed that you carry a journal or a planner for your readings could you please share with us tips on organizing i tend to get distracted by other books instead of doing research again thanks a lot jey from algeria,2
this was great so often sitting at my desk ten metres from my bed even seems too much effort so i just work sat in bed some days rarely i get as far as leaving the house,2
thank you for the video i am currently applying to phd programs in literature but i have a big question that ive been too afraid to ask anyone for what purpose do we analyze literature what concrete impact do we have on the world engineers build structures and innovate commodities that hopefully make our lives better accountants and economists impact financial situations im serious what do we do teach write books change hearts ideas,1
found this video while watching day in the life videos of other phd students im incredibly happy that i did thank you for the sheer gold comedy subscribed,2
you are awesome i feel like we are friends just by watching your videos thank you for existing you always put me onto the best books,2
well you have convinced me to pursue a life in academia studying literature d,2
hi there im actually preparing to do my phd in abroad i know this unusual but you would consider chatting over skype or something to talk about certain things regarding the application process the life of a phd student and just your overall experience regarding this subject i promise im not a weirdo or a serial killer,1
very funny good luck with your studies and stay safe in these unprecedented times,2
r c waldun has a great understanding of literature and is a reader veteran therefore has good knoledge of vocabulary also r c waldun the thinky thinky,2
funny i had an english undergrad friend who would read books in one or two days while it took me weeks to finish the same book i once asked him how he did it and he replied dont think too much just let the book take you away if you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading thats when youll read slowly and with a more analytical eye but not every book will be worth it and sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it so no point in forcing it i kinda get it because when i was learning english i would read books in english without understanding most of it at the end of the book i understood what it was about even though i didnt get everything but i just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything and get everything right the first time hello perfectionism my old friend when i read a piece of high literature or a historyphilosophy book i have to read and reread a paragraph until i feel like i got it i never enjoy the ride and thats why ive been reading less this video is a good reminder to just turn off and let the book carry you you always pick up something even if you dont realize it,1
ever heard the line he knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it that kinda applies here i never analyze a book or film on the first go it takes away the magic,0
seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us most readers dont do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things theyve read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection and in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose rereading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same if you pick it up again after a few years youre a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way,1
me an english literature undergrad chuckles nervously,1
i really liked what you said around about analysis being in retrospect recently i read the iliad a book that i had given up once before and which i knew near to nothing about i skipped the introduction which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it i was initially constrained by the idea that it was a difficult book but over time with some paced reading i found myself really curious about what would happen next i knew of course that i was doing a light reading of an overly analyzed book and that i would miss a lot of detail but i still enjoyed it and after finishing it i went back to read the introduction and found it incredible since it made me think critically about things i had read or notice stuff i missed as a bonus it also gave me desire to read it again youve earned a new subscriber from portugal looking forward to more videos,2
you are so right the first reading is to get the idea and enjoy the book but if you stop there you never know what the book is really about not unless its a drugstore romance of course i fell absolutely in love with prousts writing luckily i can read french and reread my favorite passages in their original language thats when all the light bulbs went on i didnt realize it had as many plays on words in it he has so many clues to the theme that you dont see in english you just have to read things until you get them and like you i would say that three readings is just about right thanks for another great video,2
i needed to hear this as im about to tackle some of thomas pynchons books please id love if you posted videos more regularly your content is amazing also could you maybe do a video talking about your experience reading in other languages because it can be frustrating to be facing a lot of unknown words and having to stop the rhythm of your reading i bet you have a lot of things to say about the subject thanks,2
first of all i want to say that i am genuinely in love with your essays second i want to say that everything you say resonates in me in one way that i never experimented before maybe this channel is what i was looking for and thirdly thirdly i want to say that i will stop commenting right now and start to watch the video hahah,2
these are really nice clips even though i doubt im really your target demographic having spent the last thirty years working full time in bookstores i was particularly taken with your take sorry on proust i had a very similar experience with thomas manns the magic mountain it took me three or four goes to get through it first time round but every time i started from the beginning again i was finding new stuff in it i hadnt noticed before and in the end taught myself enough german to be able to tackle it in the original which was hugely worthwhile and i still go back to it regularly proust is also great but there are large chunks of it i found really physically stifling and claustrophobic but if you read anything about his life story that makes perfect sense,2
life is a shipwreck but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats voltaire,1
this narrator has the most calming and lovely voice,2
those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities voltaire,0
the holy roman empire is neither holy nor roman nor an empire voltaire,1
i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it voltaire,1
this series is spectacular ive never seen any catalouge of the intellectual history of mankind that even approaches the depth of meaning and scholarship youre building here im blown away and deeply grateful,2
some of my favorite voltaire quotes this man was a genius being a bird aint all about flying and shitting from high places it requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mothers womb and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear it has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure it would need eternity to learn something about his soul it takes an instant to kill him of all religions the christian should of course inspire the most tolerance but until now christians have been the most intolerant of all men religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd one if you have two religions in your land the two will cut each other s throats but if you have thirty religions they will dwell in peace what can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying god rather than men and that as a result hes certain hell go to heaven if he cuts your throat behind every successful man stands a surprised motherinlaw it is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge animals have these advantages over man they never hear the clock strike they die without any idea of death they have no theologians to instruct them their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies their funerals cost them nothing and no one starts lawsuits over their wills the human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the welltrodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time despite the enormous quantity of books how few people read and if one reads profitably one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day i have wanted to kill myself a hundred times but somehow i am still in love with life this ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away to loathe one s very being and yet to hold it fast to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities the more i read the more i acquire the more certain i am that i know nothing it is forbidden to kill therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets god is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh,1
thanks school of life now i need to read some voltaire he is a very interesting man but his ideals are even more interesting so much mentioned in this video can be applied to the present day and even more can be applied to the human mind gotta love some history and philosophy every once in a while,2
hey im really impressed by your french pronounciation even in other videos your foreign languages sound flawless could you make a video about yourself like who you are what do you do and so on,2
thank you school of life for finally doing voltaire he was so witty and his views on many topics are admirable please do thomas paine next also other great thinkers you can possibly do next are david hume thomas jefferson and gottfried leibniz it would also be so cool if you did science as well along with philosophy and literature anyway your channel is great and i think your doing a fantastic job for culture im glad ive been a subscriber for this long and hope you get many more also i live in england and i might come visit your shop in london,2
very well mam i recommend the newbie who are going to start literature studies first see this video which is about all definitions of literature i hope after seeing this video you will better understand the concept of literature,2
thank you madam for making this video i was searching for the definition of literature and finally i found the correct definitiongod bless you madam,2

the bible luke the bible romans platos apology grube antigone ovid metamorphoses suetonius caligula sir gawan and the green knight heart of darkness huckleberry finn the great gatsby,1
i d love to see andrew do more literature based videos as a conservative patron of the arts i feel pretty alone amidst the utter desecration of the greats by the left shakespeare has been cancelled in some universities in the uk where i am from,0
andrew thanks for another great entry please consider turning this into a series you do an excellent job making these classics feel relevant and essential for understanding and navigating contemporary issues,2
my husband looked at me in horror near the beginning of the video when i remarked i had not read any plato he then insisted i must read platos apology as a good start klavan then recommended platos apology guess im reading platos apology,1
his son spencer klavan had a podcast young heretics that examines many of these books i recommend it especially if you tend to read books rather straightforwardly,2
husband and i went to the green knight movie on a whim not knowing what it was about we both absolutely loved it thank you for reminding me about it i want to read the story now,2
its a bit of a hard read at first but le morte darthur is another great piece of late medieval literature dealing with the arthurian legend,2
excellent list i would also suggest that anyone interested in western thought art and culture develop a basic understanding of the traditional christian mass since that is foundational,2
i read the great gatsby for my ap literature class and it is one of my favorite books ever its fantastic and i had no one in my class who agreed with me but everyone should read it its a masterpiece,2
freaked my mother out but i remember read the iliad when i was in jr high not a class assignment just on my own talk about touching on every human emotion act etc that then led me to read the odyssey,1
this guy explained better under mins than my professor in a semester,2
this was an unbelievable help i had to write a page literature review in approximately hours because like any good grad student i procrastinated what i saw as a daunting task was quickly made easier after watching this video i broke down different peer reviewed journal articles into their own segments then combined them added an intro and a conclusion and voila i was over pages i might make it through grad school after all,2
david i used your guidance in my thesis for my dissertation the quote from my committee memebers about my literature was as follows this is the best literature review i have ever read and i have read a lot of them david thank you just great stuff in your videos,2
thanks david your help with this literature review during a pandemic literally meant the difference between me passing or failing thank you so much,2
it is so amazing how one becomes so motivated to start working on something as soon as they begin to understand it i have been putting off my lit review for weeks because i did not really understand the page document given to us by our tutor but after watching this video im now so confident and fully understand what exactly it is that i need to do for my assessment thank you for such a wonderful and informative video,2
this should be required watching for everyone writing their first literature review the example is very helpful and i feel so much more prepared after watching thank you,2
thank you for making literature reviews so much less daunting i have roughly hours to complete a word literature review and i have been feeling so down staring at my blank word document having no idea where to start as a firstyear mature aged student who hasnt done any sort of higher education for the past years i cant tell you how helpful this has been i finally feel as though i might be able to finish it by the deadline and then start on another word literature review due roughly a week later,2
you are the professor a student imagines getting in university thankyou for your support,2
i have been months and months searching on u tube no one has explained professionally like this professor thats the high quality way of teaching thanks alot,2
i watched this in my bachelors degree and liked the video now pursuing my masters degree and come here again to remember all of these tips helpful again second time i wish i can give you more than one likes thank you so much for clear quick precise explanation,2
download your free writing starter kit here ps don t forget to join the smart student facebook community,2
i can not imagine how much time you have spent making this video really appreciate your effort for breaking down such a complex mater into these easy followable steps,2
i hope that god abundantly blesses you i ve nearly cried all day because everyone s break down of a literature review is so confusing and non direct about what it actually is you should do thank you so so much for this video,2
chelsea im a teacher and i have to confess that i was waiting for you to miss a detail i would have to pause and explain to students it didnt happen your videos are excellent,2
thank you so much for this video you have explained clearly in minutes what my lecturers have failed years straight well some anyway but yeah thank you so much,2
this was very well done i feel confident in my ability to complete this now i have never done a lit review before but now i feel like i have thank you,2
i have never been this energized and excited before writing a lit reviewthank you for such an informative video,2
the exact thing that we were waiting for especially the part with data search thanks for your explanation,2
chelsea seburn youve saved my life working on my thesis for my masters in climate justice and this has taken my overwhelm down about notches thank you so so so much heading to your other videos now to continue getting a handle on my research,2
thank you thank you thank you and god bless you i am writing a literature review of technology in nursing and did not realize how much my annotated bibliography and literature matrix would help in putting it all together you gave great examples for structure of the intro body and conclusion and useful points of transition also now i realize that i can write my paper as a thematic literature review absolutely brilliant,2
dude this is driving me crazy instead of travelling the world and having fun im here struggling to write a literature review,0
writing the literature review might be easier than you think no need to panic me staring at my screen for almost half a day also me fantasizing on how i would end my teachers career and possibly the whole world just because of a fricking research proposal edit i manage to pass it a few minutes after deadline slept like a log,1
tip always start with reviews you can mix up their themes maybe one review didnt do this but the other didsee whats been strongly estbalished thru time and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic from this check recent past five yearjournals about these gaps and where do they stand also literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to scihub which can put you in a psychological rut not just to comfort you but also as a professional tip you dont need to write everything you know or everything about the topic coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important moreover sufficient if you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among studies try to explain this pattern in paragraph you dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail unless you see a clash between two papers then maybe you can reevaluate their differences in method,1
great video in my experience as an academic writing teacher literature review is one of the things many students struggle with,2
learnt more from this video than i have from my lecturer the last months thank you,2
thank you for putting this into such a short succinct video currently have nine days to complete my ug diss and this has really helped,2
i just started my literature review from today and i was in hyper panic mode until i heard from you its just simple and not to panic made me calm down thank you,2
the literature review has always been a pain in the head especially that we are now in a pandemic students such as i have problems in collecting the necessary number of sources thanks ms i enjoyed the video and thank you for being a big help to those who are struggling,2
this video has superb clarity but sometimes the simple things become the most overwhelming it is correct that we can break a literature review down to structural components but the modern students who i teach there are on my university of york dissertation module are faced and burdened with limitless access to knowledge and the fields of literature become endless the student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order i find examples help so students can see the limits and horizons before them my students asked me to post examples up so this is what i did on my channel it was originally intended for my own students but there are now there for all to see good luck everyone dr mark egan,1
so well done this wouldve been helpful for me to have found a month ago but it is super helpful for my editing,2
is one of the best books ive ever read,2
the past was erased the erasure was forgotten the lie became the truth orwell,1
none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free,0
all animals are treated equal some more equal than the others,1
im a foreign teenager i enjoy watching your videos a lot especially the ones about literature its so easy to understand every word and the meaning of every sentence im extremely happy that i discovered you could you make a video about edgar allan poe i just started reading his stories and want to know more about him of course ill read the biography in my language but you make some very interesting points which is the reason i ask you for it thank you,2
this video made me feel sadness at the world and awe at george orwell at the same time,1
if orwell could see the world today,1
i read and animal farm great books,2
sophisticated entertainment and empty headed news reports all wrapped up in a constant reference to freedom sounds like america,0
i couldnt have more love for this essayist and for this author who woke me up for good when i was just a kid in junior high i share his devotion to language and the free and organic use of it and of the wisdom of the ordinary people all over the world,2
admittedly silly to subject milton and shakespeare to a kind of competition but this is well worth your time and effort the benefit of having talented professional actors reading the small bits of their works takes this endeavor far beyond the typical classroom experience truly enjoyable and enlightening,2
the two scholars are amazing and the actors are sublime ive never felt so happy in my life yet so jealous of those in that conference room ive been clapping and cheering and crying all at once wow thank you,2
very interesting discussion and amazing actingreading thank you for posting this,2
as a dramatist shakespeare makes humans into important huge things milton seems to be making important huge things have a human personification it truly is comparing apples to oranges both are preeminent english lit masters and are distinguished in their own right enjoyable and enriching experience,2
thank you intelligence squared for compiling the most brilliant instructive debate i have ever had the pleasure to view the entire show enhanced by the highly talented actors who played bit parts written by both of the literary giants under discussion tonights show will become one of my lifes unforgettable experiences,2
this was a lovely event worth it for the acting alone especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of eves awakening i do think the debate was played too much on shakespeares terms and turf in part because prof smith politely allowed it to stay there some thoughts biographical silence favours shakespeare about whom we know relatively little than milton whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss weakness aspiration perseverance hatred and love this was hardly raised so too historical context shakespeare comes clearly out of an elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like marlowe and codeveloped by writers like jonson milton obliterates the norms of mid th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism drama favours interiority and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness milton and most literary history would not have thought it so though the actors brilliantly depicted ms dramatic imagination in paradise lost his goal unlike shakespeares was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind but to go beyond them his theme is not finally the human but the humaninthecosmos in short we judged here whether milton was better according to the criteria of shakespeare shakespeare will win that battle with anyone milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether youre asking the right questions in the first place,2
harriet walter embodies so perfectly lady macbeth that its shocking at sight bravo,2
imagine the rsc with all its talented actors producing an audiobook recordingdramatisation of paradise lost oh bliss,2
a very important thing is left out i think shakespeare was aiming for a wide range of accessibility so that he could pay his bills he wrote for the ignorant barbarous ground ling and for the intellectual as well milton actually says in the opening invocation of book of paradise lost still govern thou my song urania and fit audience find though few hes pretty aware that he wont be liked by a great number of people but wants to soar above th aonian mount anyhow,1
lady macbeth was stunning absolutely stunning her acting was on another level that s passion for the work on an almost transcendental level she became that character man goosebumps,2
id just like to point out that odysseus sleeping around was necessary for his survival if a powerful goddess like circe or calypso wants to have sex with you you dont have much choice if you reject them it could spell doom for you or your loved ones horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout classical mythology,0
the odyssey is homer unwriting the iliad when odysseus raids cheats and behaves generally like a iliadic hero he is at his weakest and at the beginning of his odyssey by the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic nausica he shows almost inhuman patience and selfcontrol in the face of the suitors abuse and he choses nostos over kleos the choice achilles couldnt stand to make whats more achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the iliad when odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead by saying that it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead and he doesnt lie to everyone he knows his cretan narratives are really important nonviolent defenses against a situation similar to agamemnon and clytemnestra,0
took ten years to complete a trip that shouldve taken two weeks still x more efficient than the hebrews,1
this is me wondering if anybody else just watches these for pleasure and not to get out of reading for a class,1
please dont ever stop making literature videos because we dont have english literature in high school in where i live and i want to study it so bad even if my english is really not good,0
i always loved the odyssey both in high school english and the movie to me it was one of the ultimate journey epics like lotr its just a very very long journey with a penultimate goal of returning home but with fun little adventures and trials along the way,2
so even odysseus who is wise enough to be praised by athena for his wisdom loses himself in war does that say something about our attraction to war,0
odysseus is literally made calypsos stud forced to have hot divine sex every day for seven years calypso asking him every day to live as an immortal with her odysseus still wants to go back to ithaca and penelope he goes to the water and cries every day looking out towards ithaca odysseus devotion to his wife and people is superhuman thats why hes the hero some nice piece of information i found on the web,2
for an interesting read some people may want to check out the penelopiad by margaret atwood its a novel that was later turned into a play and tells the story of penelope in ithaca while odysseus was gone its an interesting contemporary view of a classical text,2
odysseus blinds cyclops noman is hurting me noman is hurting me a blindingly good pun,1
i love that quote about literature being forced critical thinking that cannot be googled i hope this is where the world is going soon into a place of books and curious reading rather than simply googling and having things fed to you,2
thank you so much for this im finally following my heart and transferring to a major in english literature coming from a biology major at times i get anxiety about it wondering how what i am learning will be useful aside from the fact that i love it this is just what i needed to hear,2
she is a lovely lady glad i found her i am also a literature student and i love it,2
dear denielle thanks so much for your speed in which you remind me of preparing cambridge c english exam i failed it a couple of times however i never have lost my perseverance to do the exam over and over again as a financial analyst with reference to the return of investment time spent this is my worst deal however when it comes to understanding humanities becoming comfortable with ambiguity and making me a rounded person the answer to this valuable investment is definitely yes well appreciated,2
i wish you could be my teacher,2
the liberal arts are not worthless it has to do with our system of higher education,1

one hundred years of solitude truly is one of the best books ive read so far in years of reading experience reminds me to read it again sometime in the near future,2
pedro p ramo by the mexican writer juan rulfo is one of the masterpieces of latin american literature it is considered the novel that inaugurated the literary subgenre of magical realism in latin america juan rulfos work finally gave me the path i was looking for to continue with my books colombian nobel laureate gabriel garc a m rquez confessed in an interview,2
magical realism is not from colombia because the term is european in concoction however when european writers viewed the way latin american writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of magical they viewed these stories through a lens of exotification without realising that its all real and that its a description of the absurdities found in latin american societies if we think about what exotification is its about seeing whats mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it its very much about ignorance and how what we dont understand can often appear magical as a result how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered this is why magical realism in my opinion does not exist its a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre,1
i read a magical realism text for the first time in a magazine it told the story of three dragons who were adopted by a couple they raised them as if they were human the way the author narrated the passage of their age in childhood adolescence and even adulthood is comical and fantastic at the same time dragons fight mess do drugs get married divorce and die,2
you forgot the most important and influential book of latin american magical realism the corner stone pedro paramo by mexican juan rulfo latin american writers influenced salman rushdie et al btw garcia marquez is a nobel prize laureate,2
i thoroughly enjoyed this and im glad i already had a solid enough concept of magical realism yet this made me aware that culturally it made such a political impact my debut book just a little broken i like to think is in the same vein as the genre it allows a significant amount of freedom in storytelling especially within a realitybased land i appreciate all the information and nuances packed into these videos,2
i feel like reading rushdies midnights children again now thankyou for the profound explanation cheers,2
one hundred years of solitude i finished on the second try i could see unfortunate latin america all in despair and confusion invaded by foreign powers tony morrisons beloved i read long long time ago and i found its korean version too difficult to properly understand i enjoyed murakami haruki books too i used to dream a lot almost every night each dream that i had was exactly how true magical realism was i saw no reason ever to bother to read magical realism novels,1
excellent explanation i completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against eurocentrism but i think its scope is even bigger one aspect of magic realism is politically ideological that is the postcolonial stuff another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialisticscientific determinism this aspect is more philosophical and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical ie it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes this is just my personal opinion,2
girl you saving me making this so simple and understandable,2
thank you so much for this clear explanation i read the whole section in my textbook but i was still so lost,2
thank you your videos are informative to the point and super useful,2
you are a great presenter i think it is great to have an example to support your video my students have been encouraging me to include more and more examples some even say this is the best way they learn through seeing the good and bad of other students dissertations my channel was originally set up for my classes but now i want all to access we need to me one big supportive community regarding help with academic skills that lead to student success dr m d egan,2
literature review definition a critical recap of what has already been researched on a topic why do a literature review to find out for yourself whats already known about the topic to give your reader a critical overview of what you found to find out whats missing gaps,1
you have no idea how youve helped me throughout my research project with your articles and videos thank you,2
thank you for the clear explanation love it,2
i remember doing my literature review this year and go a very good grade thanks to youre formative information now whats due is my dissertation for sure ill be back,2
thank you for explaining what is literature review i understand it very well,2
so do you mean that we use the lit review on primary sources or can you make your own lit review after you finish your entire research cuz it also means justifying the methods used in a research,1
me actually pausing the video to go get a cup of warm tea xd,2
as a student of literature i fully agree with what youre saying in this video i almost use the same exact same arguments when someone asks me why i study literature lol i love how you and your mum discuss literature so casually and playfully thats some real family goals right there,2
why i read and what book i read depends on my mood or my aims sometimes i read for a bit of escapism other times it s to learn sometimes it s both i love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking,2
emma you have the best nonbook channel book channel on yt,2
i think its down to your mindset there are some truly trash novels in existence but you can read something like normal people and take something away from it like what your mum said about her crime novels if you have a philosophicalanalyticallearning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society a literature degree is a good place to learn to learn and really develop that analytical mindset and how to write essays but this can be accomplished through so many other degrees also,1
i think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us if the book were reading doesnt wake us up with a blow to the head what are we reading for so that it will make us happy as you write good lord we would be happy precisely if we had no books and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to but we need books that affect us like a disaster that grieve us deeply like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves like being banished into forests far from everyone like a suicide a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us that is my belief this quote by kafka perfectly illustrates why we need books to challenge and disrupt us cerebrally if we re reading only for entertainment where else in our lives are we finding that sector of learning and stimulation that phenomenal books provide us with,1
i had forgotten about what it feels like reading a good book since its been awhile i havent taken a english class this semester but your thoughts made me remember all the reasons you talked about reinvigorates my curiosity to think about the human experience question the beliefsmindsets i currently have and well to study literature,2
i read mostly non fiction books on random topics that interest me currently reading a book on artists and architects since lockdown been watching a lot of documentaries on artists and galleries so i got a book on the topic unfortunately it s about pages which almost put me off but out of pride i couldn t give up only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people are no longer there so who do these objects serve this book was written in with an international look as these creators to encapsulate both artists and architects in a series of interviews have to explain their method some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space if i understood correctly each creator seeks to capture and reflect this moment in time for future generations to understand their time,1
when you read a novel how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author for instance one of my favorite books is the master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov if you read it by itself it is such an interesting novel however learning the history of its writing in the background of stalins russia makes it even more interesting how much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners if at all,2
i usually pick up a book for two reasons either because i like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality and that is why i read a lot of fantasy and horror or because i want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time for that is when i go to classics and more international literature also i totally agree with the people should read classics thing its so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations,2
thank you for this video im currently curating my documents and this is helping me search based off of the keywords,2
this should be titled how to search for a literature review not how to write one,0
you are fantastic i am following all of your videos and its really simple and clearif you could offer the coarses on the website for free for developing countries it would be marvellous,2
dear greg thanks for the video that was quite helpful i have a question a word when added to an existing search using and gives me nearly items as results the same word when added as a mesh gives me items why is this different thanks once again g,2

thank you for this helpful video it is wellpresented and visually clear,2
nice and clear i will show this to my students they have been asking me to do feedback and commentary of examples of literature reviews so i have made some for them and now made them accessible on youtube,2
this is so helpful just wanna say that thank you for helping me gain knowledge lol,2
firstly screening the literature is the most important aspect of a systematic review and for any other types sonot teaching students how to use ovid medline cochrane tec and only relying on pubmed is certainly the worst start up you miss such a large number of studies that whatever conclusion you try to draw will be biased and therefore unreliable,0
thank you for your great course as always,2
even when andy isnt trying to be a genius he is,1

i admire people who kindly spread knowledge on this planet thank you very much for that free tutorial,2
here is the transcript the literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for but regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is it doesn t prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay the literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper well what the heck does it do then well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature the literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic now remember i said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know the literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed what the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it what is that snapshot going to capture that snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source it s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is you re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff well i think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school in the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment but you know the real purpose of a literature review is it s a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date what s the first thing you and that old friend do you ask each other hey what you been doing all these years fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them by bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again you see what i m saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea,0

this song is so awesome and i cant get it out of my head,2
i think this probably resonates with all of us who have been single a while after being in a serious relationship you get yourself into situations with people you like but couldn t get serious with both playing a slight game with each other you like each other but don t need each other both wanting to give each other late night calls sometimes resisting you feel all strong and happy to be independent all day enjoying life come home make yourself some food but come pm you often realise you actually don t wanna be alone that night again and damn you should have arranged something with someone but now it s maybe too late,2
i love it so much its really good,2
perfect vibe for friday,2

pov you arent here for tiktok you are here because its a nice song,2
i used to sing this song with my bestfriend in the school library she passed away because of anorexie and now i sing it alone it hurts when you cant do the little things you loved to do with a person anymore right,0
your heart isn t glass don t shatter it your skin isn t a book don t judge it your life isn t a movie don t end it your body isn t paper don t cut it stay strong,1
its a weird feeling isnt it emotions being so powerful that even a simple song can display so much of it,2
lost my sister to cancerthis was playing on the radio in the hospital and i cant listen to it without crying,0
this song hits differently when you know the lyrics,2
i just recently lost my grandparent this song really reminded me of her i remember doing everything with her that can explain it all in one song this song really does help me get out of bed bless her,2
really gives me nostalgic vibes when i hear this song i always remember the good times i had with my old friends here i am now all alone still loving it have a great day whoever is reading this,2
i remember when this song first came out and me listening to it i truly did listen to this song every day and never really took in the true meaning of these lyrics now sitting here years later i look back on this song and finally understand although the meaning is in the title there is so much more beauty and emotion put into this song that i hope you can understand i just remembered this song a few days ago and im glad i did whenever you read this i hope you are able to enjoy this song as much as i did listening to it the first time at,2
bon jovi never gets oldespecially songs like this they just move your entire soul,2
one of the best songs of one of the best songs of the s one of the best songs of the th century one of the best songs of all time,2
this was the song my mum always asked me to play in the car on way home from shopping she passed away on saturday ill never forget this song now,2
im leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it itll remind me this song again,2
mrjon bon jovi is probably the most underrated singer of our time recently heard him without background music and choirs hes pretty amazing singer,2
listening to this song at night while closing your eyes just bring you to a whole different place,2
essa can o simplesmente maravilhosauma das m sicas mais linda que existebaqueia o cora o at de quem n o est apaixonado,1
i grew up with this still my all time favourite they dont make them like this anymore also great love and respect for bon jovi,2
me encanta esta canci n me transporta a una poca qu no viv la m sica la ropa las costumbres qu ya no existen m s qu en v deos musicales y pel culas soy del y me alegra tener gustos tan buenos como escuchar a esta banda y otras m s de esa poca,1
after probably three decades this song came to mind out of the blue still as good now as it was when it first came out in the s,2
its great video i want part please,2
i enjoy watching your videos to unwind after a long day,2
love diamonds bedroom it s so shiny and beautiful,2
i like all videos about triplets,2
the videos are always funny,2
i like diamonds room so much,2
lol the emerald girl is soo funny,2
the girl wearing the shiny silver outfit is cute,2
that i dont wanna know instrumental is straight fire s s babies know what im talking about,2
ready or not i dont wanna know in my bed for those who understand run my likes,0
i went to columbia high school with rotimi sza homie was a star bball player at the school columbia if im not mistaken still plays his version of the national athem at all sporting events super proud of the two keep going guys much respect,2
when having a bad moment this song definitely puts me in a vibe of its own,2
still one of the most underrated hits,2
mom wake your ass up for classes me oh nah nah nah nah nah na theres a meeting in my bed,0
this was ahead of its time if it came out right now in it would go,2
my mom was in the kitchen and this song came on the tv let me tell u wat she says you better not have a meeting in your bed,0
apaixonada por todas as m sicas um talento sensacional,2
who found this on the radio and searched there s a meeting in my bed,1
i still love this even today,2
pqp que remix perfeito,1
wft i love this remix,2
i love this remix,2
this remix is sick go quavo n ty dolla sign,2
i love ty dolla ign solo,2
,2
for those who came here for it,2
song reminds me of anikan skywalker,2
tf is this cover they did quavo dirty,0
i really don t know if their house value could go up or down up with the amount of stuff they ve installed or down because they ve took about of the walls out,0
i m actually pretty glad you added the secret vent door too because gaming consoles usually need ventilation so that the room itself wouldn t over heat and that s often left out in secret room builds,2
i love how these guys are out here making the forts that we all wanted as kids,2
awesome project guys but why not just put a hinge on the secret door so the bed would still be usable or maybe put a hydraulic platform so you can lift the bed and enter the secret room without actually putting a hole in the bed just my thoughts,2
for those confused about the pythagorean theorem it s the method used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle from the two side lengths the formula is a b c that means one side squared plus the other side squared equals the hypotenuse squared hypotenuse is the longest side the angled side so you simply get the square root of the c and you have the measure of the longest side,1
does anyone else remember crawling to the end of the blanket and thinking youd find some magical land or room i got the same vibe from this video,1
i would gladly pay for these guys to do something like this in my home,2
that fort could also double as a panic room in case of an intruder,1
better ideas get a new mattress put it on the wood thing you also might be thinking how do we get in the fort just lift the matress add an exit door incase someone is lying on the bed or cant get out add a small ladder that looks like a stair add a mini fridge thats all,1
looks like this youtuber will be the architect of an unusual building but epic,2
lyrics yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i know you wanna love but i just wanna fuck and girl you know the deal i gotta keep it real i know you wanna see i know you wanna be in my bed grinding slowly i know you wanna love but i just wanna fuck and girl you know the deal i gotta keep it real i know you wanna see i know you wanna be in my bed grinding slowly ay what it is what you wanna know i done ripped about a hundred shows youll be coming back to me ay youll be coming back to me always worried bout them other hoes and youll be on me when the money throw and they be looking out for quees and they be looking out for quees bitch bad no kanye when we do it do it our way wanya i give no damn bout what ya mom say rollie wrist im the shit with no kids bout to rain on a bitch ima rain on a bitch i know you wanna love but i just wanna fuck and girl you know the deal i gotta keep it real i know you wanna see i know you wanna be in my bed grinding slowly i know you wanna love but i just wanna fuck and girl you know the deal i gotta keep it real i know you wanna see i know you wanna be in my bed grinding slowly baby girl she the action dont know why you actin she on readysetgo she will never let go need it all fuck a fraction know she think im michael jackson billie jean moonwalk i need the front and the back end she in love with the fashion but she in love with the flashin bitch this aint ya money bitch i spend it on you cause you know i have it with my woes in the ex hoes yeah they sick ima rain on a bitch let me rain on a bitch i know you wanna love but i just wanna fuck and girl you know the deal i gotta keep it real i know you wanna see i know you wanna be in my bed grinding slowly i know you wanna love but i just wanna fuck and girl you know the deal i gotta keep it real i know you wanna see i know you wanna be in my bed grinding slowly rollie wrist im the shit say yeah with no kids say yeah ima rain on a bitch say yeah really rain on a bitch say yeah rollie wrist im the shit say yeah with no kids say yeah ima rain on a bitch say yeah really rain on a bitch say yeah rollie wrist im the shit say yeah with no kids say yeah ima rain on a bitch say yeah really rain on a bitch say yeah rollie wrist im the shit say yeah with no kids say yeah ima rain on a bitch say yeah really rain on a bitch say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah say yeah,1
i see rindou i click,1
this channel always has my favorite songs i love it sm,2
,1
pls add this on spotify,2
time stamp for myself dont mind me,1
thank you for posting so much,2
bro i m inlove with this song bruh,2
this song rindou is just,2
im a simple personi see rindou i click,1
thanks for the tip jim going to finally open a long position on bbby,2
bbby is still on regsho list t would be september nd then boooooooom,1
correction its gme,1
this is where i play my reverse uno card,1
allegedly founded by ryan cohen,1
little does he know the ape will not going to let this happen,0
inverse cramer time to buy bbby,1
cramer hitting the coke in the morning,1
its nice to see these very quick unscripted breaking news type of videos,2
good summation my only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in jan because it was highly shorted my understanding is its part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument and all retail companies movie theatre used game store towels and when gme went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket i cant talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on reddit prior to the last week of jan sure since becoming bagholders people think its a movement but to start with it was a value play when i went long gme was pre split with book value when i went long bbby it was with huge call option interest at and ryan cohen had skin in the game its fine playing meme stocks but i suggest getting in when the chatter is low and if ryan cohen is involved make sure your cost basis is less than his,1
if people want to worship one mans words and previous actions to the point where they buy a stock on command at an elevated price then its their own damn fault,0
if you don t do something about your financial situation your income remains unchanged while expenditures keep rising these got me seeking the best answers to invest my k any ideas here,0
i think more than anything the meme stock phenomenon is a protest against the vitriol exhibited towards the retail investor with that said i do and like having a small portion of my portfolio reserved for speculation having made some good money off of picks like amc and bbby it s small enough where it doesn t hurt my long term investment goals and strategy and large enough to have fun with as long as you don t put more down than you re willing to lose and fully acknowledge it s a casino have fun with it just be safe set your stop limits and take profit as you go not financial advice just how i conduct myself,2
note bbby is on vendor credit watch which means bbby have to pay for goods in adavance,1
ah bbby yes thank you i threw in a little bit of money and ended up tripling it thank you i am too wimpy to go big but i am happy with the small win never throw a large sum into something this volatile,2
videos consecutive days impressive,2
its funny to see people say rc abandoned retail investors when bbby literally ran in just month,1
her editing makes me feel like she s the only one left on earth,2
her content is maturing the same way she is less chaotic more genuine and realistic loving it,2
shes the only youtuber that makes me want to be healthy and work on my mental health she makes it look so peaceful,2
shes the only person i can watch do literally nothing for minutes and not get bored at all,2
tomorrow is about to be crazy im going to fucking do some crazy shit like i might even go to the grocery store tomorrow lmao me too emma,0
emma posting twice a week is literally the best thing that could ever happen,2
the fact that her life is so relatable to ours makes me want to be influenced by her lmao,2
i like how emma doesn t need someone around her she s able to enjoy her day without anyone,2
i was so brainwashed by the whole life of an influencer from social media that i never realized that theyre just like normal people seeing her journal lay in bed with her cats without the chaos of having a million things to say all for the sake to keep us entertained that really made me cry a bit i love how raw her content is now i feel so at peace thanks emma,2
this new editing style makes me feel so emotional not in a bad way just every single time i watch them i feel so many good emotions love this new style emma and from the looks of the comments everyone else is enjoying it too you are truly an artist,2
give a big welcome to saint punk with his smashing monstercat debut,2
appreciate the love everyone and thank you monstercat,2
after xqc buddha ming anthonyz and sykkuno have all collectively played this on their streams during getaways this has unofficially become the theme song for nopixel,1
people coming here from streams just shows how much promotion the streamers can give a song sucks they can barely play any music without getting striked,0
even sykkuno is jamming to this song during getaways nodders,2
i can imagine while listening to this song how tony corleone doing some drifting with his audi r and do some sick cinematic camera,1
i love that the drop on this sounds like its devestating my speakers without actually clipping its so harsh and powerful sounds great,2
tony driving to this is just so satisfying,2
maybe when these dmca free songs start getting millions of streams maybe music companies will realize banning streamers for playing their music is dumb,1
best getaway song hands down makes me wanna drive fast,2
andrew is my boyfriend,2
love andrews lexis and brents reactions these are the best,2
brent s face tho when andrew said we already did a hour challenge in the bed,1
i love when andrew saidlook at what were doing now guys are just so bored,2
i just love how theyre all getting money together living their best livessquad goals,2
andrew and his jokes this is what makes his personality so great,2
lexi what would you do if you won the andrew id probably put my money in stocks and stuff also andrew sike im going to a strip club right after this,1
i love the way andrew went all out and even recorded when he tricked lexi i found it so smart,2
i just love it how andrew and lexi always are together or partner up in everything,2
love to see the squad back together,2
this song never gets old no matter how much i listen i never get bored,2

beds are hard in no way am i a professional when it comes to bed styling but i figured i d share my take on a few beds which bed was your favorite,1
u deserve a tv show we all want to see drew on a big screen tv right so proud of u mom,2
love that you did this not a lot of home decordiy content creators show the small yet important things like how to make a bed look like it came out of a magazine so really appreciate you doing that more smallsimple yet so important things please much love,2
nice beds if you like the bed sheets to look crisp like they were just ironed make the bed and then lightly mist spray the sheets including the pillowcases with plain water using a standard spray bottle this works on cotton sheets which will stretch out as the mist of water dries out it is a luxury hotel trick the sheets will look pristine especially white sheets,2
i love this descriptive talkthrough format of the video for us less designinclined mortals it is incredibly insightful to hear your breakdown of the reasoning and choices,2
oh drew i loved all of these stylings but felt that the rd one just tied in all of the colors of your room especially the dark paneling and the th one added a soft warmth great texture would you please do a similar video for window treatments styling different curtains patterns colors with the rods etc i would love to see all the different ways you would style a window,2
drew not all these designs look perfect in this space designs all look perfect in the space i love it im a big fan of your videos,2
flat sheet always goes face down so that when you open the bed to get in you see the pattern top and bottom and you are getting into the pattern these are all so gorgeous,2
id watch more of these bed styling is so interesting to me would love a part,2
hi drew loved how you styled the bed picked up a lot of tips im going to try i would love to see you style a buffet thats an area where i have a little trouble would love any tips you could give thanks have an awesome day,2
regardless of what you think about chris you cant deny his talent this boy produces pure fire in the booth,2
this whole album just gets me in a zone,2
the people that disliked must have made it to the bed and dont know how it feels to not make it,0
que talento sem compara o,2
his music blows me away everytime amazing as always he has the power to make u feel something special each time you play a cb song must see him in concert please come back to sd,2
when my husband blasts this in our car the bass is crazyyyyyy,2
dude just knows how to make a hit,1
essa m sica merece um clipe,2
this is why i need a boyfriend,2
he definitely the baby making music of this generation,2
well you should have appreciated how much effort and love he put videos he works so hard to make a smile,2
ant i am litterally unkillable also ant dies minutes later,0
he banned his teamates but he could have just switched there teams,1
has anyone ever gotten banned for a few hours or days from using gm in custom bedwars,0
i love your videos keep it up,2
pov you re that one person that gets emerald armour or diamond armour early and starts to carry the team,1
i m surprised that he didn t know that all beds breaks in minutes lol he didn t even think about that,1
i like how he stand on the generator when he has inf iron and inf diamond and inf emerald,2
ant i used to like your old mm videos and jailbreak videos bedwars can you play actual updates and play a real match with no cheats that would be epicly cool and awesome,2
hi ant im glad to be your fan i just want to ask how to use ur code bcs i dont know how toand its been yrs playing roblox i still have no robux,2
these bed wars videos that you are doing are amazing please keep doing them,2
a good one would be put a hole in the bed defense and they will think its already broken,1
this champion never fails for us he always tries his best to make all of us laughsmile make our day so thank you tanqr for all the videos youve made for all of your fans,2
i ve watched this video like times still never gets old,2
hey tanqr love the content tanqr keep it up,2
i build or bed defences one of them is very good the rest are covered with wool but the bed is under the wool,2
fun fact this is the only vid were tanqr defends,2
back then the bow had a thicker line and it was so much easier,2
legend says these bait scammers are still out there baiting innocent helpless noobs,0
lol i could totally do this with my bed the guy who lived in the house before i did mustve been big into multiuse furniture or something because instead of a box spring its a storage area with a foldup lid that the mattress goes on top of i dont know if i could actually fit in it and im not taking my mattress off to check but in theory i should totally test this whenever i move out,1
the fact that he always post videos for us,2
happy birthday chase i hope you have the best birthday ever,2
happy belated birthday chase,2
happy bday preston and chase i m a huge fan,2
preston s videos never fail to entertain someone,2

published on jun,1
its a shame they dont make music like this no more,0
i had no business singing this at the top of my lungs at years oldmemories i figured it had something to do with goldilocks and the bears lol,1
ive been on a dru hill binge steps never make a promise these are the times in my bed dru hill needs to be more recognized,1
sisqo sang the hell outta this song i remember being years old when this masterpiece came out and i gotta say this was by far the best era for rb music they just dont make songs that hit like this anymore,2
you could hear each one of their voices come together true talent harmonizing,2
goshi can remember watching sysco when he was a teenager working at the fudgery in baltimores harbor place performing while making fudge he drew such a crowd everyone who walked by would just stop what they were doing because he just had a way of drawing you in its so nice to see that they still have that ability thats what you call talent,2
the part when they do the bounce though,2
sisqo had million dollar voicepurely platinum,2
music doesn t give me this feeling anymore omg,0
sisqo ran back in like shitimma join in,1

this is how i will remember amy healthy glowing thick confident cheeky and happy she was at her prime during those frankera days frank was the perfect mix of pure jazz and rb,2
years passed already time flies she was so authentic and genuine full of the special talent rest in peace amy,2
this song is a bitch the rhythm is hypnotic and the intro the intro amy in full flight the only white english singer to capture the essence of black music long live amy,1
frank was a bomb ass album great lyrics with infectious beats and sassy themes amy was enjoying her music then and being a musician the fame and limelight was there yet after this album the critique and scrutiny awakened her many insecurities i guess sigh but what a talent she was great,2
ella no sab a lo hermosa que era siempre que la escucho siento una mezcla entre alegr a y tristeza una luz un talento que se apag muy r pido,1
she was soooo healthy here hair healthy skin healthy body healthy just so youthful and ripe for the world man i wish we could have gotten more time with her,2
kinda sucks how people mostly talk about how they wish she was healthy and how unhealthy she was just listen to her voice and seal your lips her voice will speak to you and the composition will answer your questions just let go of wishing something better,0
first time i heard this song i was floored its both timeless and avantgarde ordered the album immediately,2
wow first time hearing this song from her and this beat is sick,2
such a tragic loss this poor baby never had a chance will all the vultures surrounding her thanks for gems like these,0
this man is still killin it after so many years,2
im not sure if a lot of people really understand how gifted this dude ishe is yet to do a song that i dont like he can sing he can write songs best dancer right now as far as im concerned he can act and he can create wicked visual art i think if he didnt have that cloud over his head that a lot cant move on from people would really see a new king of rb,2
how can you not be his fan he is just so gifted he puts so much of his heart in his music,2
when youre chris brown and you dont have to collab for a rap part,1
i know legends in my life and theyre chris brown christopher maruce brown breezy hands down,2
he will go down as one of the best most creative artists especially with music videos teambreezy,2
this is chris brown at his best he has mature is so many ways and i love it this album is phenomenal i play it my car when i m relaxing in a bubble bath sipping on a glass of pinot grigio he s proving to be the king of rb,2
ooh damn damni just realized chris is years nowthat means we probably got like years more to see his ass in this industrymahn this guy aint gon fade anytime soon,0
m sica foda clipe bem produzido n o sei como n o tem mais acessos,1
king of rb hands down,1
nico is back the living w can never take an l,2

rofl it was like a killer of a movie being taken care of and suddenly coming back her face to subtrist was gold,1
these always make me crack up lmao,2

no other youtuber has ever made me laugh out loud as much as y all do pls keep it up man,2
i wish i still had zoom calls to randomly see you come on welcome back boys,2
it just kept getting funnier didn t even realize it was an hour long until mins in absolutely hilarious you never fail to make my days,2
i gotta give props to the admin for looking out he was telling them off at first but the next minute he was like if anyone is stream sniping let me know and ill do something about it cool guy,2
that admin truly understands soup will bring popularity to the server and is looking out for the guys against stream snipers massive respect to that admin,2
as a soup fan from the rust timeline i appreciate these actual half roleplay experiences the cool admins and high pop cool servers are very nostalgic of the early good ole boy himself,2
once again soup is really becoming a huge part of this server and it s so funny to see it s got so much lore too he just inserted himself,2
soup you never failed to keep me entertained through the years,2
love the long videos keep them coming please,2
yo when soup uploads an hour long video and it s not a compilation you know it s gonna be good,2
blessed with an hour,2
soup just wanted to let you know your videos make me laugh and help me through tough times in my life appreciate you brother keep up the grind,2
go watch new bub films video now,1
i don t know why they keep getting angry you re doing a great job as a traffic warden good on bub for protecting and serving our roads,2
the car just randomly exploding after the gate closed looked like a planned assasination this made me laugh so hard,2
if you hold c you can move props around without moving your character youll look like youre standing perfectly still,2
i m scared that bubs is gonna get too popular and that he won t be able to make these videos without getting recognized lmao,0
it blows my mind that people are on the internet simulating police traffic stops,0
entite misuse with a tent most intelligent moderator,1
ah yes the invisible physgun technique used to do the same stuff back in much fun,2
i love how they say nitrp but when you commit crimes a flying police men flies out of nowhere and freezes you in air,0

bro i haven t watched you in a year but the legend is finally back,2
likes for part leave a comment with funny protest sign recommendations,1
homosexuals are gay i mean hes not wrong,0
i have so much respect for the guy who agreed with the christmas decoration debate,2
its almost heartening to see some people at the protest connect with him and laugh along with it,2
karen we are allowed to have free speech also karen getting hot and spicy about a guy with a sign exercising his freedom of speech,1
stop premature christmas decorating every single filipino well shit,0
imagine a whole protest of absurd signs like this i would join,0
why use your sign to block the camera when you can use your body lmao that got me laughing so hard,1

ngl that professor has a lot of patience,1
this man is the reason that zoom meetings now have passwords,1
poor keith my buddies have his class currently and although his class is difficult he seems like a pretty chill dude,2
poor professor hope he s okay in life regardless this might be my favorite trolling comedy i ve seen on zoom i was dying of laughter this stuff is just too silly the chemistry between the computer science professor and subtrist is very interesting,2
i absolutely love that this guy is putting his school life on the line for us it means he loves us,2
keith was so patient though he is a good teacher i feel bad,1
the amount of patience that teacher has is impressive tbh,2
ah man usually these are hilarious but this teacher seems really kind just trying to do his job,2
i love how at first people started laughing but then they started getting annoyed yelling into a mic for the th in a row or swearing isn t funny unless you are like like most of our audience here,1
free shipping use code free checkout,1

ellen is a legend she didnt even care basically a sacrifice to keep jj on here,1
yo subtrist is so hilarious especially his face with his glasses and his reaction,2
this is so rude but funny i feel guilty lol,0
i m glad subtrist has some boundaries trolling a citytown council meeting is the line,1
i already know this is going to be hilarious,2
love the consistency nobody does these hilarious videos always very impatient when it comes to waiting for new content from you,2

this guy went through so much in so little time i feel bad,0
you can join the server i play on here also if you want to show support and help me out please use my referral for the best vpn you will also get free months and off with my link here love you guys,2
you gotta get the soundboard that sounds like a npc getting run over,0
the sound board works but not every time you need to get sounds of npcs idle talk getting run over pretty much reacting to what players are doing your first give away is the fact you are looking for players i get it its to pretend to be an npc but just pass by some players,1
nothing gets more npc than the i want to apologise guy you should troll with that npc,0
if you don t break character you can actually make players think that the npcs are starting to do really weird shit,0
you literally picked one of the most playerlooking npc s so of course there would be some confusion,1
the soundboard makes it so much funnier lol,2
you have to troll drip johnson with the npc next indubitably,1
i like how he actually started trying at the end there to get revenge xd,2
the kid basically saying respectfully after saying get out the car with a gun is hilarious,1
alex s channel,1
the black guy was the truest one i dont fucking know im just trying to get some money,0
lol i respect alex for knowing that if you get bullied the best thing to do is go along with it,2
if somebody is truly proud of who they are they dont need the whole world to adore and praise them,2
you attack the issue not the man what a wonderful lady and a great quote,2
its bizarre how these people were so extremely judgmental they dont look at themselves in the mirror i guess,0
this trio has to do more videos together it s straight up comedy,2
thank god they re back together hopefully we get some more russian predator catches,2
alex is the most based person youve had on this channel,2
how many genders are there i don t fucking know i m just tryna get some money said every corporation lol,0
this kid was lucky to have this happen with you and your friends im sure if it had been someone else they wouldve just jumped him,2
love how this little kid acts like hes fully grown but doesnt realize how bad this situation couldve turned they act like they understand the real world but they dont,0
so basically the kid took the scooter then traded it to his friend ryan then these other kids took it from ryan and gave it back to you but then he changed his story every seconds,1
youre a legend its absolutely ridiculous that children can steal scooters a lot of negligence behind the parents side,0
gad damn kid gon become an origami artist he folded that story like times,0
why did you tell them i took your scooter because you did face of extreme anger,0
i m glad that y all were mature about this a lot of people would ve not handled it that way,2
when some random people are able to teach this kid better morals than his actual parents,1
on a side note its nice that at that skate park although different in ages they all seem to get along and respect each other the little kid at the end are smarter and cooler than me,2
bro the way he got so angry when his friend told the truth lmao,0
thanks for all the support new vid in a few days join our discord,2
imagine being a resistance member in s and youre able to kill a higher rank member of germany just to have some dude fly in the air and yell at you for rdm,0
glad those people who take that server seriously dont go outside their room,1
i cannot imagine how pathetic someone has to be to want to roleplay as a failed states police lmao,0
why am i being arrested this is a free country jewish man in germany,0
you re not allowed to counter superior forces there s too many reich officials here isn t that what the resistance did lmao,0
the guy who shot the officers trying to arrest them is a total chad,0
scott literally killed them and won and then they drag him back it s like kids who used force fields when playing army at school wow how the fuck did this get so many likes i guess y all had a lot of goobers in your school too,0
you cant attack a more powerful force as a resistance member tell that to the taliban buddy,0
as a german id just join the server and start speaking german and complain when they try to communicate with me in english,0
whoever doesn t want chicken nuggets is a certified pathological liar,0
the predator shit is so funny make a full video of that,0

the fact he has a pole trampoline the thing he used to swing on already and set up in his room is hilarious i demand a part,2
the fact he can do all this without seeing what hes doing is absolute gold,2
im dying at how enraptured people were at chriss pole dancing like legitimately blown away,2
honestly when he fell doing ballet and said i m still learning and that other guy said that s ok it was beautiful was so wholesome haha,2
genderbent kermit pole dancing me lord forgive me for what im about to do,1
chriss friend what is ur work chris i am a virtual prostitute,1
the dedication required to make this video is insane,1
i swear this guy is so funny it puts a smile on my face,2

instagram,1
i will not tolerate you disrespecting my brothers with your nose candy,0
it was so satisfying hearing jane almost crying the fact that she randomly brought in race to the conversation says a lot of her character,2
bro its actually sad how that lady just brought up race without anything leading to them doing it because of race,0
trolling jane was so worth it her reaction was golden,2
jane sounds like the kind of person you dont want to have a conversation with everything would be turned into race,0
jane was so but hurt over disrespecting a brother,0
jennifer yoon seemed both happy and mad at the same time,1
i like how jane thought she was some hero in the call when everyone just looked at her with embarassment it was so bad that even subtrist got out of character,0
that racist jane was so hilarious disrespecting a brother lmao you disrespected the brother,0
thank you for k subs merch is out right now on,2
this is the man we all neededisnt scared to tell his opinion,2
how to avoid drama step don t use twitter at all just delete the app step live a happy dramafree life,1
men should always open the door for women guy without arms nervous sweating,1
as a woman i loved this lol,2
twitter creating a safer environment for people to freely express themselves in pxrge freely expresses himself twitter you werent supposed to do that,0
i miss the times where everyone was like this and didnt worry about getting canceled lol,1
to the one who said stop crying and men can t show emotion if we re gonna follow stereotypes like that then get in the kitchen and cook,0
i hate when these feminists talk about how men dont know how to be gentlemen anymore even though whenever we try to be gentlemen we get called simps its not that we dont know how its that we arent allowed to be gentlemen anymore,0
i literally only use twitter for saucy art and for updates on the video games that i play i tend to skip out on reading the comments on most posts too because people love complaining about everything youre doing this world a service good work,1
just a compilation of my funniest clips this year so far,2
still cant believe you got james to stop talking,0
this is so immature but for some reason it s so entertaining probably because it s so incredibly easy to avoid trolls like this and these people get so mad rather than just handle it,0
when jj just kept saying hey jj just kinda throwing himself in here and not trying to throw you against a wall was some of the funniest things ever,2
james and lucy are hilarious the way he turns and menacingly stares into the camera and goes get out and then lucy going there is something wrong with your computer you have a computer virus,0
james is one of the most terrifying people ive ever seen on zoom,0
man i really wish we had more polite people like james,0
the way he stared directly into the camera with that concerned expression and ominous music playing and said get out made me literally laugh out loud so hard,2
just because your bald doesnt mean you have to be mad at everyone,0
i don t mean to punch you in the face here and absolutely break ur skull lol,0
if you want to see more content go subscribe to my new channels who will be the first sub reacts streams shorts,1

suspects list kiply bionic lynix doni,1
i was at the live stream and i loved how everybody blamed doni lmao,2
the chat was going crazy i had to see the reaction the chat completely incomprehensible screaming,0
liger great video but there was flaw that maybe next time you could fix you see we couldnt freaking see the chat of the time,0
so sad i missed the whole stream but this idea is so good lmao i burst out laughing everytime the chat is triggered,2
i like how the chat is like you win liger,2
i love how in the thumbnail everyone was confused even doni bobes was confused,2

deadpool making a grown man crumple with blackmail the vanguard lobby holy shit,0
i always wonder how does this man get access to their lights,0
this dude dose gods work and makes it a voice troll what a damn legend,0
we need more new deadpool trolling video its just too good,2
you can call me bethany if this makes you more comfortable such a deadpool thing to say,1
the deadpool voiceover will never get old,2
how does he do deadpool so good bruh lmao,2
okay being one to laugh at deadpools jokes i am going to say this out loud he managed to intimidate me and that is not one easy task,1
bbh actually still cares for skeppy no matter how many times he trolls him thats just wholesome being friends for a decade,2
a render engine is what makes stuff appear on the screen usually using raycasting like ray tracing but without the bouncing off of objects it detects what it hits and then displays that to the screen this is probably one of the most common ways of doing this but their might be otherways correct me if im wrong ty the only thing ive seen with render engines is with blender and its eevee cycles and workbench render engines,1
alternative title skeppy being clingy to badboyhalo for minutes straight,1
we need more of this skeppy managed to pull off this troll so well,2
this is a great way to scare bbh instead of using a normal troll its perfect,2
this is the best type of troll they cant quite tell if this is a troll or not its not just chaos its just unusual but plausible events happening unusually often,1
the scariest part of this video is skeppy leaving all those floating trees,0
that fear in bad s scream at the end was genuine lol,2
everyone says we need more people like him but never says we need to be like him,1
hi skeppy im having a really crappy day today and i just wanted to thank and appreciate all the effortwork that you put into all your videos they always help me out and especially today because one of the pets i own a cat passed away this morning not looking for sympathy just wanted to thank you for your amazing videos they really got me through today with tears and laughs rest easy squidward thanks again skep,2
andrew tate is like that uncle that thinks hes giving really good deep advice but in reality hes had a series of broken marriages his kids got taken into foster care and he refuses to believe hes got a drinking and gambling problem,0
im sorry but the way he said youre poor took me out i was not expecting to cackle the way i did at that lol,0
i love your channel lol gives me a much needed giggle,2
the women featured on his podcast are incredibly patient,2
the ok guy gets me every timethnx for the all the lols,2
its scary to know he is actually being serious you would honestly think this was a character he had made up,0
ok this was so dumb and funny at the same time lol,2
at it again with the best content lol thank you for the laughs,2
i hate to say it and i hope i don t sound ridiculous but i don t know who this man is i mean he could be walking down the street and i wouldn t know a thing sorry to this man,0
the fact that he gave himself a full head of hair in a fantasy story of himself can never be not funny to me lmao,0
i cant believe his reaction at the end it got weird k likes,0
this child has been practicing his pick up lines for this one moment,1
i m not into fortnite anymore but this mans entire sense of humor and content is hilarious,2
absorber wha i don t even know your name kid my name s tarnel barqueesh wha,0
the things absorber has to embrace for these videos is amazing you have my full respect,2
its just the confidence these kids have,1
he s lowkey funny though,2
the year old dude just has humor dude,1
i was pissing myself laughing the whole time,2
i don t know why y all didn t see that coming he literally had a sugar daddy,0
these guys are nicer than the average german these days haha,2

loves when jay posts makes my day,2
youve did it again jay you made another good video,2
as somebody who despises my little pony i approve of this video,0
gorloss is one of those guys that i would have as a friend he is super chill,2
your channel is really awesome im glad i subscribed your do a very softcore type of trollingminging thats not destructive at all,2
i got a bad feeling about jay doing experiments next thing you know he creates some kinda scp pony,0
almost hit the min mark d,2
despite being a brony i find this hilarious though i find the cartoon horse program funny also so theres not accounting for taste i guess,2
insta,1
she s definitely a candy corn,2
mowing one was wholesome at least he got a laugh out of the host,2
it would be nice to see a more intricate trolling video where you ve been attending regular meetings and become a regular just to fuck it up or you host a meeting yourself and kick people for dumb reasons and get reactions,0
i don t know how clive has been so patient with sub after all these years,0
bravo subtrist bravo i hope you live the best life ever lived my man,2
subtrist you are a youtube legend these videos never fail to make me burst out laughing keep the great stuff going,2
its more funny when you guys say subtle things and manage to stay in the rooms for longer like,2
when bob asked what does stfu mean and chris said what it meant it had me dying,1
bro when that lady hyped up kendrick s new album i almost died she does not strike me as the type to listen to kdot,0
hilarious new zoom vids soon i have like vids worth of never before seen footage im trying to get to k on instagram please follow me for good luck for life,2
manz was on demon time when he said how does it feel like to be in a retirement home lmfao,1

shoutout to the people that actually started laughing in the meetings coz this shit was hilarious,2
maybe the hardest ive ever laughed,0
youre probably pushing,1
ive been crying on the floor because of how funyn this is,2
i haven t laughed this hard in weeks,2
is my favorite part it s just so chaotic and cynthia s face,2
send this vid to andrew tate,1
great to see subtrist spending time with the feminist community in fact he saved my daughters from a fire last night in his bugatti with andrew tate,2
i like when you troll in a sense that participates in the class peak content,1
i felt bad for the old man i personally would join his passion for philosophy,0
im years old and this is honestly hilarious reminds me of my high school days pretty funny content for such young kids lmao,2
this was legendary no matter what andrew should look at this i died laughing,2
yo joe your grandma is big as shit got me dying,0
you know youll have a good day when my man subtrist uploads another banger,2
tate didn t last long at all haha please do more of that,1
i wanted to thank subtrist for conducting a special speech on my daughters zoom channel congratulating her on going back to an all girls school andrew tate even drove down to the school in his jeep and presented a specialized plaque to commemorate the end of roe vs wade,2
yall should stay protected on the internet and especially for gaming use my referral link to get free months and off the vpn in the world,2
good thing about chernobog is that you dont need to worry about running out of missiles coz it blows up before that,2
i love how hunting down griefers has become a sport in gta v i love this,2
chernobog is best paired with a friendly jet the combo absolutely dominates sky combat,2
tip the chernobog is actually a glass cannon it cant tank any explosive hit at all,1
he s trying to get another jet eh the moment i realized putther is canadian,1
imagine being a jet griefer not knowing the chernobogs capabilities,0
appreciate what ya do for the gta community ur damn hilarious and provide alot of tips and always willing to help out other players either that or troll them which at times ill admit is fun,2
drop one thats half an hour long putther upload one where youre killing griefers in many ways from riding the train to using vehicles you dont normally use to trolling,0
such a great youtuber always makes me laugh love the edits amazing the way you use them keep up the great work putther,2
shes the type of person to measure how much sleep she got using a ruler,1
she definitely made horsecat noises when playing at recess,1
i get why people would get annoyed if they were zoom bombed but it was ridiculous how ss was accusing yll of being immature and childlike while she was talking like some year old diva,0
shes the type of person to climb a glass wall to see whats on the other side,1
the way she just said okay after you told her no promoting,0
she studied for the covid test,1
she was definitely the type of kid when she was younger who thought she was the main character in a high school movie,1
i love how she tries to make fun of them and no one in the call laughing at her jokes,2
shes the type of person who puts a makeup on her forehead to make up her mind,0
that first woman literally looked insane,0
im glad soup is doing more rp again its what brought me to his channel on the first place,2
i love how everybody with an ounce of authority in these rp servers just know who you are now youre like their boogeyman lol,2
let s go dallas you ve done it again with another legendary gta rp video,2
i love seeing these children get so mad over their precious rp server rules getting broken shit kills me,0
towing people is literally all i do in gta rp it s too funny especially when they re in the car when you re towing it,2
when soup uploads a new video you know your day is gonna be great,2
im loving these minute long gta trolling vids,2
ive waited for so long to see you guys troll people with a tow truck lol,0
i couldn t stop laughing at the absolute chaos halfway through soup you are an rp legend,2
actually to think about it soup literally never breaks his character and that s the aggravating part for everyone involved lmao,0
pls like the vid before i go to jail,1
i like how the first person was more threatening then the actual cops,1
buddy actually made the police laugh their asses off,1
i think hes there to learn,1
the amount of risk and effort he puts in this videos is insane he is such a legend im not even lying,2
imagine threatening to murder someone over zoom bombing,0
how much courage do you have to have to troll the police,1
i lost it when the police started laughing and homeboy had to get up,0
stfu whats your fucking address is gonna be my go to response for everything,0
wait i thought you were the kid that had me dying lol,1
we finally got our first sponsor d pls check it out try dashlane for free on your first device and head to if you decide to upgrade to premium use my code luke for off,2
i swear the old people laughing with finger waves is one giant acid trip,0
hes a hacker yes a man in a sinking boat is hacking genius deduction,0
those times when he joins the classes that are just doing silly things anyway is strangely wholesome,2
i love how unlike other zoom trollers luke is just being funny in very wholesome meetings,2
i don t know why but luke making the older people laugh and him playing along with them makes me smile,2
luke is the kind of guy that kinda looks like a jerk but he is making everyones day,1
oh man havent laughed that hard in front of a video in a loooooong time thanks for making my day,2
luke is one of the best trollers out there cuz he makes them laugh other trolls just insult other people and that can only be funny for so long luke just makes people smile,2
i love how in this video no one is angry or just confused everyone laughs well at least most of the time most people had a laugh which is great,2
i added a couple clips at the end from a video that got taken down they were too good to be left in the vault,2
greg is so high hes on another planet,2
i fell so bad for randy he got violated so hard,0
greg is that mock meat subtrist no its real meat greg mm greg spends a whole minute trying to remove him from the meeting without saying a word,1
bro i died of laughter like poor randy didn t even do anything,0
greg is legit the definition of the lights are on but nobodies home,0
the fact that subtrist didnt even need to troll at first because greg was enough content as it was,1
greg is absolutely hammered he would make a great father,2
greg is like the drunk uncle at thanksgiving,0
poor greg the side effects of being vegan is kicking in,0
lets appreciate how he is making us happy and suffering from those oders,2
you don t miss the old roblox you miss being happy flamingo,1
respect to this guy who was brave enough and had the stones to do that to expose orders,2
he has been online dating for minutes straight we should appreciate how brave he was,2
this man makes me laugh in every video he makes,2
enjoyable video orders need to stop it was a family friendly game but they ruined it,0
when you struggled at the perfect time in the beginning,1
welcome back cherry i missed you so much ahhhh,2
welcome back i missed you,2
hey cherry i really like ur vids they make me laugh,2
what should we do next,1
i also once leeched from a clan they called me their little farmbot and in reality i would steal their stuff and despawn it,0
these guys had the best patience ive ever seen in rust,2
is this what you think of our friendship is this what a bigh bot banship,1
i hope omirlol is getting paid he s literally the funniest character you have on your channel,2
this guy has talent,2
for some future video you should definitely build like this huge base just overnight near some big clan bases and have him be the only guy claiming to have built it by himself with turrets and those missile things on top and have him talk shit to the clans that come by saying how their bases are puny something like hans and franz talk look at your puny base its nothing youre nothing maybe get the clans to try and raid his huge base with lots of turrets and stuff that would be pretty funny but you would need a huge base that is already built and able to paste in easily,1
the guys screams for help when the boats spawned had me dead,0
the first one if he was smart he could have just picked up the window lol,1
you can feel the emotions on his voice i cant stop laughing this guy has freaking talent bollywood talent,2
who has a more annoying voice lucas or omrilol,0
this isnt the lucas we asked for but its the lucas we deserve from time to time would have him in video again,2
id love to know how many people have bought rust based on how fucking funny your videos are i dont know how you find all these characters but they are all amazing,2
imagine after the base tour they come out and their base is surrounded by like base clones,1
when he started counting the foundations of the copy base i lost it lol,1
as a spanish talker i can tell you this guys were hilarious haha they were extremetly confused and when they were talking in spanish they were just talking about how weird and funny omrilol was hahah,2
for those who dont know spanish now youre my i love ukraine but i have a problem with france bro long live spain now my friend will come to talk with you thanks fredd to farm wait you wait there franchutito thanks fredd you want the base no so bro im gonna call you franchutitolittle french right what you doing youre escaping from the part where i put you into the dogs house why do you leave no my dog bad dog youre the only french that i like bro so continue counting bro right you you can dig bro search a bone entertain yourself there brother thanks fredd yes every language no no no i already made a report already made a report he cloned my base dude thats a high level rust player behaviour right there get your spanish moms out of the room now enardo learn spanish too,1
this was the best admin trolling video ive seen ever and its all coz of omrilol what a role playing legend,2
what a great actor i hope he gets paid lmao,2
i rarely burst out laughing y all had me laughing out loud multiple times this is a hilarious video,2
this is traumatizing and im here for it,0
theres a chance that half of the viewers of this video probably dont even know some of the nextbots origins,0
the videos you do always make my day,2
the fact that nitronuke always makes my day his videos never fail to make me laugh love you nitronuke,2
bruhh they really added realistic characters into roblox bros avatar looks like him in real life,2
the smurfs made me laugh so hard,2
you make my day so happy i love watching your vids,2
you never fail to make me laugh,2
i still enjoy your videos you literally make me laugh everybody s reaction was hilarious i m literally gonna beg for voice chat now i swear keep up the great work nitro i ll be there for k ddd,2
i watch your videos over and over again they never get old i love your content,2
turn on post notifications so you don t miss these live join the donarchy server discordggdonarchy,2
you are almost single handedly saving this generation,2
man this turned from trolling feminists to trolling discord mods and i m all for it,2
you are being transphobic ugh these people are absolutely insufferable these people actually willingly surround themselves with other people like this,0
let s take a moment to appreciate the other chill feminists in the vc,2
as a woman his argument is completely valid it takes two to tango and if one member gets pregnant then they both have to discuss further progress you cant just get pregnant with someones child and go off and abort unless is was an assault situation in which the woman has absolute control of what comes next because thats a horribly traumatic event the woman has to go over proceedings with the man,0
as a member of the nico community we need to get rid of her,0
if anything i feel bad for nico being so paranoid and insecure that she automatically assumes everyone is harassing her regardless of whats being said even someone with the same name was enough to make her feel threatened must be so draining you know no wonder she sounds like shes always on the verge of tears shes also a discord mod so no surprise there i hope she gets the help she needs,0
if abortions are legal how come british people are still born is probably the best pro life argument i think i ve heard,2
calling someone racist or phobic with no evidence to back it up shows true ignorance,0
joe your grandma big as shit dawg had me dying,0
why does derrick have a pad on his forehead,0
im literally dying of laughter this guy is so funny,2
love how theres at least one toastmasters raid in every vid how are they letting people raid their zoom meetings when they should know that its easily occurring in every one of there other meetings lmao,1
its always a good day when nico uploads,2
this video was funny as shit the long drawn out trolling is funnier imo,2
when you re still hopefully trolling as an old man nicoisold,1
this is a certified hood classic,2
that woman having a mask on on an online meeting is one of the most ridiculous things ive seen in a while what does she think shell get out of it,0
when bob popped up as the therapist i lost it,1

love how you got kicked for fail rp after they used grab script to remove you from a moving vehicle then teleported you to the cell area then kicks you for fail rp fail rp is only a thing for anyone thats not a mod or add imagine,0
i just cant get over how you got kickedbanned for shooting and resisting an leo whilst in custody noone tell them that happens irl,0
lol they kicked you for fail rp even tho the cop was also fail rping,0

i love how soup trolls so hard and what get s him kick is spawning cars out of thin air,1
wish soup would start his own lobby become admin cause chaos and then just wait for them to call an adminhim,0
seeing you trippy and yumi all play together is hilarious,2
yumi is the best addition to rp trolling,2
i gotta say i absolutely love watching every single one of these and i hope it never stops,2
soup got that mcdonald theme laugh,1
soups laughter is hella contagious,2
when a pastor is talking about witches and announces a burning service i was relieved to see it was just books and not women he was burning,1
thanks for this owen watching this guy lose his poop constantly on one hand is entertaining but he is doing real damage to unsuspecting people who have fallen for his rhetoric as a christian people like him make the saner ones among us cringe constantly i do not expect everyone to believe but we all have to live together and need to treat everyone with dignity human kindness there is no place in our society for this kind of hate,0
i am a christian and democrat so there s that there should be a task force to remove tax exempt status from churches that engage in politics,1
i have to admit this is hilarious however its also sad the fact that theres a remote possibility of this guy or anyone for that matter truly believing in this crap is disheartening and makes me lose faith in humanity really sets us back a few hundred years also if the devil were real this guy would undoubtedly be doing his bidding and not that of any loving god by preaching hate and encouraging division amongst people,0
as an actual witch i find it absolutely hilarious that this burning service of his resembled a ritual in almost every way,0
i read a good statement those who are afraid that reading books will influence thinking are not afraid of books they are afraid of thinking,1
this is obviously terrifying but can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that he is attempting to cleanse objects of negative energy with the element fire thats legit one of the witchiest acts of witchcraft out there lmao,0
as a real witch complete with all of my spell books and tarot cards i think it s absolutely hilarious how the witch paraphernalia that he was burning was just maleficent and harry potter merchandise lmao,2
i think the fact that greg locke gives his crazy sermons in a circus tent is poetic,1
as someone who got away from an unknown prophetess who shared a similar view its scary that he actually has a following while it is hilarious and admirable someone trolled their book burning i find it scary since that only served to strengthen and prove him right in his mind and in his following im just scared if they actually start to become dangerous to that man and us its a trolling joke but to those people and greg its real and not a game,0
dude the british kid went from an annoying kid to an absolute chad in the span of a few minutes honestly props to him for trolling with soup,0
soup is a unique person one minute hes beefing with year olds next thing you know he made his own revolution with them,1
i love how there are just types of rp players the hardcore nerdy ones that are dead serious and those like soup that just have fun annoying others,2
dude that little damn british kid killed me with the nerve endings thing,0
the british kid is amazing oh no i tickled his little nerve endings killed me,2
this made my little nerves ending tickle one of the bestfunniest rp so far,2
and then we stab her in the neck soup was spot on calling him a bruv,0
soup messing with british people is top tier content,1
love you soup never fails to make me laugh,2
lmao yessss i love the rp nerd trolling like star wars and harry potter,2
the real winner right here,2
so the history repeats a level supposed to be created to be impossib e using hacks or extremely thigh gaps ends being legitimately beated by a high skilled player perfection,1
funny as fuck really good editing good pacing really good overall wulzy video,2
im surprised wolvez and space were up for this tbh,1
tride is the definition of work smarter not harder clearly that is why hes a youtuber,1

im really suprised that anybody in the server didnt get banned people would get banned if they looked at an admin funny or something,1
welcome to garrys mod where all the kids are admin and brain dead to understand the basic rule of being an admin and ruin the game for others,0

the nostalgia of the k videos is back theyre really amazing to watch especially with the mic brushing it always puts me to sleep thank you so much gibi,2

i honestly really needed this after spending the past few days stressing out your videos in general are just super helpful with my anxiety and i can literally feel myself relaxing by the minute,2
i know some creators can get too repetitive with their content but your expansion on this idea is simply brilliant and people like me get to benefit from your amazing and relaxing work,2
seriously this womans imagination never runs dry all her rps especially the your hair is series have really shown us all how inquisitive and ingenious female asmr really is i feel like her originality not only gives pleasure but also inspires many other people to put on their own thinking caps along with that she seems to herself enjoying making these types of videos which personally makes me enjoy them even more and honestly i cant wait to see more unique n amazing posts from her much love to you as well female i hope youre doing well too stay safe and do keep up the spectacular work v im earlyyyy btw,2

i love it that he puts his hobbys in his videos i like it that you can see that asmr isnt the only thing he has in his life but also has a life outside his career and that he likes to share his passion,2
the amount of energy and effort you put into all of your super relaxing videos is on full display in this one for sure,2

something about your tapping is so amazing it s the sharpness but not piercingly sharp your nails and the way that it sounds like it s echoing perfection,2
is this an alternate gibi universe timeline where gibi actually liked the planes that flew over her house so much that she decided to become a flight attendant,1
as an ex flight attendant this is incredibly detailed especially the safety demo gave me flashbacks i wish i had been able to give the demo in a way as calming as you were,2
i love how when gibi asks for options she doesnt specify which one we pick for example she asks which one would you like then she says okay perfect and no matter what someone picks it seems really interactive also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us,2
id love a everything is wrong version of this with us the viewers being the only ones on the flight and were in a rusty old plane that could drop at any given point perhaps daisy could be the flight attendant,2
fun fact most aeroplanes have above head cabins for the crew to sleeprest in during flights that s why you might not see a specific crew member for a certain amount of time they re probably up there my mom is a flight attendant so i get all this information from her don t worry it s the real stuff,1
the attention to detail is unmatched the background noise the safety demonstration even the cups were like aeroplane cups,2
i don t even have any allergies but the consciousness of allergens is so comforting idk why i know it s really scary traveling with allergies for you gibi so i can imagine how nice it would be to hear those words from a flight attendant,2
i made timestamps lol use them if you want to sorry if they are not precisely correct welcometodays sponsor a little safety demonstration flight attendant coming to check on you turning on sleepmode at your screen offering you something to drink sparkling water tapping bubble and water sounds choosing your tea flavour making you tea tapping paper and water sounds giving you a hot towel info about the snack basket and breakfast going through the breakfast menu with you and checking if you have any allergies going through the snack basket showing you your grooming kit showing you the in seat buttons and the tv stuff lol getting you ready to sleep good night,1
the safety demonstration is one of my favorite in real life asmr triggers i always look forward to it and watch very intently on flights lol so i m very happy to have this video to watch on repeat the lighting and attention to detail is just flawless gibi you re incredible,2
the first first class flight attendant roleplay from many moons ago is still one of my favorites to this day and gives me the best asmr i love theseeee,2
was not prepared for her cat staring into my soul lol also love this video its so relaxing,2

your asmr is truly the best ive never felt this much tingles before thank you so much,2
so perfect for doing my homework and studying tonight thank you hope everyones having a good time back in school,2
i love it when an asmrtist tries something different and it works excellently,2
the sound is amazing keep up the good work,2

you re amazing plz do a longer version,2
i work nights and it s so hard to fall asleep when i get home but ur videos help me sm,2
i dont know if you can call it a genre but this is my absolute favorite style of video eartoear sounds and up close whispering are just tingle and relaxation heaven for me thank you for the wonderful video as always gibi you spoil us,2
i saw on gibis twitter that this video made the person who subtitled it fall asleep and after watching it theres no wonder why i almost did the same but i got to the end cause i didnt want to miss anything all these soft relaxing sounds were so good i especially enjoyed the plush watermelon borrowed from satine the small brush and all the whispering of course thank you gibi,2
i love the part where she says it s gibin time and everyone falls asleep,2
this right here is such classic vintage gibi that im surprised she didnt bust out the ol dio and put on the headphones,2
hey gibi i dont know if youll even see this but i really appreciate your videos i went through something very sad and difficult months ago yesterday i wont explain what im going through and how i feel mainly because i dont think i can find the words to describe it anyways i just started watching your videos a couple days ago and your content is the only thing that has managed to calm me down enough to sleep thank you so much,2
the velvet boxes make a return love those little guys the pitter patter while tapping on the box sounded nice too real cozy vibes,2
putting this here so whenever anyone reacts to it ill be reminded of this masterpiece,2
my favorite part is when she uploaded she always makes my day like the thousands of others here too,2
the soft crinkling noise from the watermelon sounds like a crackling bonfire and i absolutely love it i need a whole video of just that item on loop lol,2
quite relaxing easily top asmrtists,2
all of it sounds tingly i love this video so much,2
you re so talented and extraordinary,2
im impressed with the mouth sounds and the way you make them cloud,2
the fast wet mouth sounds were really intense and tingly,2
this was really good loved the kisses and the tongue clicking especially but all of the mouth sounds were superb,2
the first slow to fast mouth sound video ive seen and it did not disappoint love you and your videos both gems,2
this is great,2
ayee this vid was amazing don t worry about the noises in the back in a way it adds a bit of trigger plus i bet we were all concentrated on the mouth sounds from,2
not much to say this timeyou left in awe with this exceptional video crystalhoensty how can somebody be this perfect and amazing at what they docheers to younevertheless best wishes for this upcoming fall semester and may luck be on your side love you fr,2
the worst part is you spent so much time making an incredible deep and intricate lore that is intertwined thru hundreds of videos and i dont think ive stayed awake thru even of the videos ive watched,0
at this point we should all be proud to be born in the exact time period and multiverse as uncle rift,2
this guy makes the weirdest concepts for videos like hes literally making a statues out of your flesh and he makes it relaxing in all seriousness keep up the good work,2
er could literally make a video about paint drying and i would enthusiastically watch it at this point,2
for some reason i wanna see him make sir this is a wendy s asmr lol,1
not only is uncle rift good at asmr storytelling and photography but hes also skilled in sculpting thus man will never cease to amaze me,2
honestly i have no more guesses on the next video this man can do literally anything,2
at this point uncle rift is gonna draw us into reality,1
ive learned english with his videos the first video i saw was one the first iggy manlys to this day the og iggy videos have this type of sharp voice and are my favs but i always listen to him while doing homework i got myself better headphones to watch his videos and listen to them in better quality really can not say enough to thank this man with a big m,2
happy to be one of the first viewers on this one been watching this channel since you ve always reigned my favorite asmrtist excited to watch the video what a classic concept,2
lattes eyes are so kind it s like she s saying it s ok i m here just by eye contact,2
the fact that the windows get darker progressively is a sign of how attentive to detail latte is amazing work,2
latte would you ever consider doing a behind the scenes of your asmr filming process i am so fascinated by how detailed your sets are how perfect you make them and how you embody every aspect of the role you re playing for these asmr videos it s incredible i d love to see a behind the scenes of you setting up and filming i think many others would too,2
latte is so incredible i am a teen and struggle with anxiety depression ocd adhd paranoia body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria ptsd and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending annoying or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality i ve watched all of her videos including the ones in languages i don t understand and there wasn t a single video i didn t like i love and appreciate latte so much,2
the airline realness here is out of this world the white china the way the food is plated the picture on the back wall its just outstanding,2
i and hopefully other people would love to see a behind the scene of the making on of these videos,2
this woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice some asmrtists as fine as they are do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners there are patterns of sounds which means some sounds will cause relaxation other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers dont realize that these cannot be mixed me for an example hate very high pitched noises hate plastic and eating sounds latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos she just knows whats up,0
whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it instantly relaxes me you are the only asmr person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner your voice is just perfect for this,2
latte is so passionate she even bought a plane for us,2
omg i just noticed that the sun is setting outside the windows the attention to detail latte puts into every video is just incredible,2

read me i forgot to answer the first question on the screen im sorry my answer is id rather pick talk to animals even if it wasnt a perfect communication would be unbelievable to be the only person who could do that sorry hope yall see this before getting mad at me for skipping it lol also i reference asmr galaxys channel if you love watching would you rathersipad sounds this video is directly inspired from theirs definitely check them all out so many great videos,2
your handwriting is so amazing it s actually visual asmr for me,2
omg now you gotta make this into a series your ipad videos i remember the first one with testing out brushes was the reason why i started my asmr channel now i m expecting a large series with parts of would you rather lovely you re the best thank you for the mention i don t think i even deserve it,2
love so much that youre a jojo fan what a relaxing video i love the tapping sounds,2
my life is complete knowing that gibi has used one of my examples lol,2
can we just talk about how nice gibi s handwriting is,2
couldn t get enough of the ipad tapping sounds these questions were great would like a sequel possibly with some original characters would be interesting to see officer barts answers to some of these questions,2
it s currently midnight even though i m so tired i know it s worth it and i already know it will love your vids keep em up and goodnight everyone,2
the ipad tapping sounds really good the writing too i really like this background since it helps me watch it before i sleep,2
hope yall see this before getting mad at me for skipping it lol i personally wouldnt get mad for something like that but still im glad ive read the description first before watching the video like i always do,2
my mom used to play one of these with me ours was growing a vegetable patch you would till the soil and make the rows then planting the seeds and naming each type of veggie as you went then covering the seeds with dirt and then rain falling over them all and sunshine shining on them to help them grow tt u tt very good childhood memories indeed these were great to listen to thank you so much for sharing and triggering a lot of us in the best of ways,2
erin they bite you they bite you me is relaxed and sleepy asmr is weird sometimes,0
some little time stamps treasure island kittens cool winter night happy birthday beach,2
i love the clear visible and audible pleasure erin takes in lines like its a snake and it attacks,2
i havent thought of these since my mom passed away when i was young since she used to this to help me sleep at night this was really relaxing and these were so nice to hear again,2
the nostalgia on this was off the charts my earliest asmr experience as a kid along with playing with hair were these back tracing games,2
the version we did as kids where i live was honestly a bit weird the direct translation would be three knives to the back blood runs down spiders crawling in your hair snakes round your neck crack an egg on your head and the yolk runs down and then youd usually say boo or something maybe lightly push the person as youre saying it too so yea pretty hardcore for a bunch of year olds lol,0
such a nostalgic thing for me my mom used to help me sleep with these every other night in my country we call them wierszykimasa yki which roughly translates to massage poems loved the video,2
this stuff is so interesting my version of the shiveries was so much shorter and had like half of the same elements its cool how much these things change from place to place and time to time,2
there s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down there s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down i m sleeping with pam s mom sometimes dinner,0
hi all i hope you enjoyed d if you want more videos of the characters ill link here daisy lorelei sybil luna mistletoe bart robyn pompom fleeb florb tatyana sybil bart daisy and lorelei give you manicures ps if you want to see the signature page ill post it on my ig story,2
now this truly is the gibiverse of madness,1
being a british person myself gibi an american actually did a good job of doing a fairly convincing english accent as robyn literally never thought id say an american would ever do that but there ya go edit thanks for k likes,2
i love that robyns signature is literally an x marks the spot,2
sybil giving us some tea and essentials for the road is the cutest thing ever shes so mumsy and this is why i love her shes probably my favourite character in the gibiverse,2
no one talking about pompom shes like someone who would sit and listen to you while in your darkest moments and when your bored she always has good ideas to help you i love pompom and love to see more of her and lorelei too,2
the fact that no one s talking abt luna saying want a quickie oh i shouldn t say that,0
can i say bart is just an amazing addition to gibis world of characters,2
daisy dont say hi to lorelei i owe her money pov character goes to lorelei first and gives her a paper that says daisy and nothing else damn we savage,0
the most impressive thing about this video is the fact that each character has their own thought out and individual signature thats some ace character creation,2
leave a thumbs up for your favorite trigger and goodnight,2
let the anxiety melt away let the overthinking stop for awhile you deserve relaxation you deserve comfort be kind to yourself please,2
her nails be on point every single video and it s so satisfying,2
the bassy sound of the lint comb is so unique its a weird but wonderful cross between a cat purring and a frog croaking,2
your nail tapping has the most unique sound but the quality of your asmr is what stands out the most it is by far one of my essential can t live without nightly routines,2
time stamp preview hand sound phone case leather fingers fabric covered stick wooden cracker and etc lint remover notebook cardboard ring hluru finger picks purple mattress sample goodnight and sleepwell,1
ive been watching asmr for years and ive never had these kind of affects omg thank you so much,2
yes pleaseee right as i opened youtube to fall asleep literal perfect timing i don t know if i ve ever been this early haha thank you for another super tingly video,2
hope your nights have been well people i know i personally struggle alot daily with anxiety and such but its always best to find something that calms you down at the end of the day i hope those of you watching this for maybe your anxiety or insomnia find the necessary peace you need tonight struggle is just another path towards a new destination and you will meet the end eventually from one challenge to another we keep growing anyhow this message goes out to everyone i hope you are all doing well and are safe somewhere tonight sleep well,2
hi love your asmr and creativity,2
install raid for free iosandroidpc and get a special starter pack available only for the next days,2
honestly you could make anything sound nice gibi it s you the items you use are just a bonus,2
gibi thinks she s got some things that will sound nice i m quite confident they will be amazing,2
the usps store in my hometown is atleast the times ive been in there very quiet and simple the workers are soft spoken and sweet and i cant even remember music being played really its not an awkward quiet but a comforting one with a little bit of paper shuffling background noise,2
her whisper voice is so clicky and precise and perfect and it s so relaxing i ve never heard another asmrtist with such a satisfying natural voice,2
gibi the answer is always yes we like everything you do we want all the vids,2
imagine being the salesperson in the shop and see gibi tapping on stuff to decide whether or not to buy it based on how it sounds,1
incredibly excited for the fairy post office the tiny envelopes and wax seals i adore the idea of a pen shop role play i like both show and tell and trigger videos you should make whichever one you feel like at the time,2
your rps are out of this world amazing i m still vibing from the trojan war medical muselyre player but as this video shows and as we all know just plain gibi excuse the oxymoron isn t too bad either excuse the understatement thanks for the zs edit follows actually i should not say gibi s role plays are out of this world they are in this world they portray pieces of who we are or want to be or pieces of people we know or want to know or of people we have met or want to meet or of friends or personal assistants we have or want to have and this is just one reason why they are so amazing,2
when you were talking about possibly doing a fairy post office i imagined it being inside of a flower one soft color with little lights either warm or cool depending on the color of the flower,2

it s a little thing but the consistency between haircuts is comfy like when u rly get to know ur barber as a person,2
your voice is so calming and you easily put me to sleep and that s definitely not a bad thing i couldn t sleep until am you just got a new sub,2
i have bad social anxiety and anxiety attacks and stuff and started listing to you at night now during the day if me anxiety sneaks up i m also a recovering addict and these video s wee brilliant man thank you,2

i m a new subscriber loved the video it s so relaxing tingly,2
i love this man this is so relaxing keep up the amazing work,2
the lap videos are always so amazingly comforting love the little rings on your nails and the sound they make while you trace really nice video,2
glad to see you did this again and you added long nails these lap videos give me such a safe and cozy feel it makes me so sleepy before i can even finish the video,2
love that the camera focused just in time to see the confusion haha also those fingernail ring things make a really great sound thanks for this pls tell your neck were sorry,2
your asmr is so calming and soothing,2
listening to this with earbuds for the first time in a long time and it s rly a whole new experience it s soooo good edit i used to listen to asmr without any earphones and was fine for once i thought about using them pls don t be weird in the comments lol,2
just saw this came out cant wait to hit the sack in a couple of hours and fall asleep to it thanks so much love your videos,2
amazing visuals and her voice is amazing this is so calming i will fall asleep in no time,2
this is super relaxing i enjoy your positive affirmations especially from this angle as your comforting words combined with your lovely hand sways give lots of tingles thanks glow,2
i love these types of asmr videos makes you feel so safe and relaxed,2
absolutely magnificent video glow would love to see more of these,2

i got a few frequently asked questions in this vid so i answered them in the description ily,2
i was dying laughing at all the background noise even then i loved your reaction to it honestly it wasn t even that bad,2
the fuck off had me dying i always love your follow instructions videos,2
made me feel that tingly feeling between my eyes it was perfect,2
the background noise actually added to the comfort for me because i felt like i was just hanging with a old friend at their place in the real world the imperfection makes things feel safe,2
when you dont cut out background noises but use them as your advantage is the way of a true asmrtist,0
getting that raven feel with your hair color from teen titans it looks rad love it,2
thanks luna bloom this really put me in such a relaxed trance like state,2
i could honestly kiss the person who invented follow instructions type asmr so tingly hipnotize us with your light saber chopsticks queen,2
loving the new hair colour hope the move has been going well and that everything youve packed made it safely thanks for the video and have a good one,2

pot farmer dance song i got out my pipe stuffed it with pot you better believe it held a whole lot i whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain i tried alcohol smoked cigarettes they did nothing but give me regrets my mom had arthritis could not walk around i rolled her a joint she danced on the ground i thought i was losing my lovemaking knack after i smoked some to me it came back soon i decided prices were high i searched for some ground i wouldnt have to buy i bargained for seeds from smokers all around got in my truck and drove out of town i walked through the woods where wild birds nest found me the meadow i thought was the best i dug up the ground sowed all my seeds said a small prayer for strong healthy weeds i watered at night with a fivegallon pail mosquitoes went hungry for i wore a veil seven months went by i thought i would die till the halloween moon was high in the sky at night i went out in a camouflage suit used my corn knife to chop down the loot i hung it up to dry where it couldn t be found came back and got it when it had turned brown i trimmed off the buds stuffed them in bags called all my friends and passed out free drags in less than a week my crop was gone i flew to st thomas with a love hungry blonde by kansas city poet tom zart google most published poet tom s poems are free to share google george bush tom zart google pot farmer poem,0
those songs were so deep in lyrics and such soothing melody make you feel it s a punishment in getting older to hear what passes for reggae music today,2

the whole world and their comfort foods us and uk,1
timestamps south korea nigeria trinidad and tobago haiti italy united states jamaica dominican republic guyana china mexico united kingdom thailand colombia puerto rico armenia peru pakistan brazil okay last one yessss egypt omg it took a lot of time pls pin me so that everyone can see their cultures comfort food,1
im chineseaustralian and i started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when i started watching this video it turned out that i had a very similar experience with the chinese lady in this video as well my parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal i could ever have wanted i also requested this when i was sick and also when i got braces on because i could only eat soft foods it really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is,2
my comfort food is maggibeing an indian i literally grew up eating ityou can just eat it anytimeevery indian loves it,2
im filipino and my favorite comfort food is called bananacue its basically banana covered with crunchy caramel but typically we dont use just normal bananas we use a kind of banana called sabah and its like banana but bigger and a little bit firmer typically served on a stick but its up to you on how you want it served,2
i m mongol and my favorite comfort food is the blood of my enemies,1
im polish and my comfort food is pierogi ruskie its dumplings with potato cheese and garlic filling boiled and then fried in bacon fat with crispy bits of bacon and sometimes caramelized onion sprinkled on top with a bit of butter for that extra creamy taste i can eat them by kilograms,2
i dont know why everyone is disliking the british one for me i think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether youre happy sad tired exhausted or energetic personally i dont even like bread and toast but for him it might be his comfort food which he can have it all the time whenever he wants to without even thinking about the preparations to make for a grand food xx,0
being british the best comfort food is at chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are perfect they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage and if you like it the bone marrow it s perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside hope i described it well edit also marmite and cheese inbetween pieces of toast just jjejjsjsjsjsjjssjisisjenjd,2
a fellow mexican here and i have two different comfort foods for when i want something sweet i go with arroz con leche because its good for any time of the day and can be eaten cold or hot which means its good for literally any time of the year and my other comfort food is definitely pozole it is just so good and warm and it gives me memories of all the parties i went to when i was a child,2
does anyone else watches these videos as a torture challenge while youre hungry as hell,0
as a native chicagoan i can safely say portillos is pretty great the italian beef and their crinkle fries are both so so good however as someone who visits missouri yearly you can never say no to lions choice it puts arbys to shame with real roast beef gotta get it with swiss and au jus with a fountain ibc root beer it doesn t get much better than that,2
i loved your list really well put together having lived in wa and born in oregon i can attest that both restraunts are very important to us,2
as a native idahoan i can attest to the fact that boise fry company is amazing they have a buffalo burger that is divine and i prefer the purple yam or sweet potato with fry sauce and blueberry ketchup,2
i was born and raised in anchorage and i can all but guarantee you that while tommys is atbest pretty standard its an absolute tourist trap and has been since i was born in go to long branch saloon for burgers and if you want a more alaskan experience try to go for a salmon quesadilla from salmon express during saturday market my recommendation is to order it spicy but even getting a regular is going to be excellent even if youre not big on seafood,2
went to north carolina for my cousins wedding back in october mentioned that we were going to go to bojangles the following day we had two people at our table that were close friends of the bride and groom the groom being my cousin they immediately got excited and told us we had to go there it holds the record for being the only place whose biscuits i love i am a native seattleite and have had likely hundreds if not thousands of dicks burgers fries and shakes throughout my life in high school we had them for lunch every saturday good times good times,2
that was an awesome list and i agree with all of the places that i ve been to personally can t wait to try the ones i ve never been to,2
born due to a portillos spicy beef then raised on chicago dogs college was filled with in n out and la street dogs now getting ready to move to steak and shake to raise the kids once a midwest girl always a midwest girl,1
another fun facts burgerville is the first fast food chain in the us to be unionized just a couple years back also the spicy bean burger is amazing,2
this seems like a list that only talks about restaurants that were founded in any given statei want a list that actually confirms what everyones fav fast food restaurant is regardless of where it was founded,2
huge thank you to ali for making this trip possible follow him on ig alinhamdani get early access to videos and be the first to comment follow on instagram for more fun food videos besteverfoodreviewshow,2
this is a different pakistan that media shows me thanks best ever food review show for showing us the real pakistan and its peaceful people sending love from the philippines,2
this was the absolute best some genuine laughs some dark humorthis is what close minded people need to see your videos in general shutting down all stereotypes learning gapping cultersbring us all togethereven in some failures love this stuff ya guys,2
i officially have made pakistan my number food destination after uzbekistanthank you sonny for keeping us entertained and learned always,2
i want to go to pakistan just to eat food with ali i really enjoyed his personality hes got a great sense of humor and hes obviously super passionate about educating people on the beauty of his country,2
im a carnivore so pakistan is the place for me for the meat everything looked so good and the host were awesome sonny does a great job of bringing the food and culture of pakistan and its people to the forefront was interesting and very informative to watch lots of fun too great video,2
that mountain town is one of the most beautiful places i ve ever seen the buildings the scenery the food the health of the people incredible i m jealous that life style seems so simple and fulfilling,2
the hunza valley part was absolutely beautiful simple untouched by anything from the outside world gorgeous simple people scenic beauty and fabulous hosts fantastic fantastic vlog amazing presentation of a hidden culture,2
pakistan tourism owes a great deal to you for revealing hidden gems such as hunza valley greetings from india,2
this is one of your best sonny loved the content and the video god bless pakistan its beautiful people rich culture mouth watering homely food and mostly importantly sonny for bringing this to us,2
all other states has their iconic dish nevada buffet,1
as a european who loves italianstyle pizza one of my culinary dreams is to travel to new york to try their pizza but also to chicago to try the deep dish one awesome thing about the usa being so big and so diverse is that you can find literally every type of cuisine there both genuine and americanized,2
i know i m late on this video but it s absolutely criminal that tennessee s signature food wasn t nashville hot chicken considering how big it s gotten,0
im from md and can confirm our love of blue crabs albeit most people i know would rather get a dozen steamed crabs and pick it themselves than get a crabcake just because picking crabs on the bay is a fun nostalgic activity i suppose crab cakes are usually preferred by touristspeople who want to stay cleancivilized meals haha seriously though if you come to md in the summer go to cantlers or mikes crab house near the bay bridge you wont be dissapointed,2
as someone who grew up in new jersey i do love salt water taffy but sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from nj the term submarine sandwich was coined in my hometown of paterson by an italian immigrant thanks wikipedia white house subs in atlantic city is one of the jersey shores oldest sub shops and of course the jersey mikes chain started from in pt pleasant yes your local deli probably makes a better sandwich but jms subs are at least far superior to subway,2
im from tennessee and frankly im quite disappointed yall put memphis ribs over nashville hot chicken its literally our staple food at this point considering how big hot chicken has gotten,0
born and raised in sc never had a low country boil i thought itd be shrimp and grits it doesnt look bad but probably something youd find more on the coast specifically charleston than inner state and ive noticed nc is more known for their vinegar based sauce than their tomato based used to work for a bbq restaurant so thats just my experience from outoftowners,1
as a west virginian i can confirm that pepperoni rolls are definitely what i was hoping to see,2
wow looks delicious guess ive to visit the states someday and this video will be my food tour guide really curious about those chicago deep dish pizza thanks from indonesia,2
our family moved to wa state from mn back in after nearly years of living there i was only years old but grew up on tater tot casserole i was told it was one of the many recipes my mom took with her from mn and so it explains it as a mn favorite food,2
the indian packaging for the fries is so satisfyingly efficient,2
nikhil had so much energy and was actually trying the food makes me want to travel to india just for the mcds food,2
i love that basically everything has a vegetarian option in india i m kind of jealous,2
the thing that was not mentioned in the video is that there are two mcdonalds in india north and east zone run by connaught foods and south and west run by hardcastle foods the menus for both of them are different meaning each of them have their own exclusives i think nikhil was having the south and west mcdonalds they have a bigger menu compared to north and east indian laws donot allow foreign companies to hold of business in india they are required to partner up with a local company so mcdonalds partners with connaught foods and hardcastle foods dominos with jubilant foods yum brands partner with devyani international sapphire foods and more recently burman hospitality starbucks with tata coffees etc so the local companies do get a say in the menus which is why the menus may be different at different places in india,1
what nikhil says from is absolutely right it might seem its cheap to the foreign viewers but in reality it is actually quite expensive for the indian population,1
there are actually extremely different mcdonald s menu s in india i am from north india and over there most of the things are different from the menu shown in the video edit the comments are actually telling me that there are two official distributors of mcdonald s in india and because of that the menu s vary drastically which is pretty interesting actually and you guys could do a food wars seasonspin off showing the regional differences between fast food chains in india itself,2
nikhil is genuinely the best person to represent indian food on global media he knows his shit and how to accurately talk about indias various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds,2
i love how crystelles part was a really serious and well presented historygeography lesson and they cut to nikhil just be like its like crack lmfao,2
kinda want to try indian mcdonalds after this the masala potato wedges and the other sides look pretty good and the paneer burgers would be fun to try,2
when a british person say its the real deal it puts a little fear in our little indian heart if you dont get this you need a history lesson,0
we need more of nikhil on food wars the pre planned banter between joe nikhil is damn funny,2
dominos india used to do twisties twistie bread they used to be these long braided dough with garlic butter and oregano seasoning brushed on top long time back they were an off menu item and the cheapest thing at dominos these teiesties were decentralized and being a broke college student the twisties helped me a lot,2
i love how brutal the commentary is in this one its about time somebody puts dominos in its place i never really understood why people like them so much but to each their own i guess its just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for btw nikhil is so funny i hope you have him on more often,0
i have wanted to visit india forever to experience authentic indian food it s my favorite cuisine but based on these videos i m almost tempted to go just to try the indianized version of our crappy american fast food that i never eat in the states the curiosity is kind of killing me now,0
dominos india have deteriorated a lot over the years their cheese burst doesnt burst anymore stuffed garlic bread doesnt have cheese in it and most importantly they dont use cheese anymore its all vegoil based cheese substitute even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before i used to love dominos before but now its a nightmare,0
ive been living in india for almost years now and prefer its pizzas much over the western menu i still remember my first year in india seeing a big dominos ad where theyd advertise two new pizzas with exotic vegetables the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective,2
fyiwe also have garlic breadsticks stuffed garlic breadcheese dominator pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza cheese pizza out of those cheeses is a ghost pepper flavoured cheeseparatha pizzared velvet lava cake and butterscotch mousse cakewhich is the most heavenly thing available on the whole dominos menu but its also true that these items are region specific thats why it is there in kolkatawest bengal but not in bangalore,2
loving this series we get such boring dominos pizzas here in the uk the us pizzas looked good the indian ones were interesting to see i d really like to try that apple dip and cinnamon sugar dough dessert from the us and the indian chocolate lava cake looked yummy,2
i m so jealous of all those cool vegetarian options,0
nikhil is pretty funny chicken maximus which sounds like a roman emperor who is also a coward because he s chicken,0

me as an american when he says hes going to try to spend at food trucks ok so youre going to like or trucks cool,1
i m actually so impressed with how much he was able to buy for,2
so proud of original hockey moms brownies getting recognized they re the bomb and such an amazing family run place if anyone goes to minnesota it s a must try,2
as a mexican its hard to imagine burning the rice on purpose,0
me as a canadian colorado fries man im so jealous sonny people in canada are jealous me,0
when street food is more expensive than in a restaurant you know youre in america,0
when its difficult to want food your videos genuinely help,2
you can literally buy almost everything in indonesias street food with and of course they taste awesome,2
everything is looking extremely deliciousi didnt know that we can these yummy things in thats just amazing,2
i love teriyaki mcburger,2
ive only known george for minutes but hes too precious,2
when i lived in japan about years ago macdonalds had a burger called the mcgrand it had a creamy dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce tomatoes and so on it was so good that i still think about it occasionally i was really disappointed when i moved back to canada and it wasnt on the menu here,2
the japanese packaging is cute i m also surprised mcfloats aren t a thing here but the ice cream machines are always down so maybe that s a factor,2
i used to work as a manager at mcdonald s in canada and i also travel to japan often so when i do get mcdonald s in japan i often like to try something different there it s been a few years since i last went partly due to covid but i tried the locomoco burger and hawaii blue drink and both were pretty good oh and the teriyaki burgers are pretty good,2
coming from a person who s from hawaii i m surprised we don t have some of the hawaiian stuff that japan has lol as for the us side missed the chance to add the hawaii breakfasts,1
also who thinks they should send me to tokyo to try the exclusives irl that d be a good series right,2
funny to see a teriakyi burger i cant have tomatoes due to gerd and other issues so i tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with i tried teriyaki on my homemade hamburger and it was a great alternative funny enough japans mcdonalds does the same thing lool my at home one was fantastic so i have no doubt they love it,2
the japanese saucepackaging is awesome this is probably the coolest thing ive ever seen at mcdonalds,2
a number of years ago mcd did a limited global menu thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the us i think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that i remember was a burger from spain and a stroopwafel mcflurry from the netherlands i dont remember trying the spanish burger it really wasnt anything that different the stroopwafel mcflurry was awesome tho was sad to see it go anyway i knew a little bit about the japanese exclusive items and was hopeful theyd continue it and do a run with a few of those here the mcteriyaki burger sounds awesome and im surprised they havent tried the mcfloats here ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the us and it would be so easy a dr pepper mcfloat would be really good for us taste im also kind of upset they ditched the snack wraps probably a us exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around they had that i remember big mac a barbecue crispy chicken one and i think a bacon ranch one wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito i think you got per order and they were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if thats what one was hungry for on the go,2
deadass all this looks x better than my school food,2
then they mix it all together god she was too happy about that haha i give points to celine for being so grateful celine is so precious,2
celine is so adorable the parents did well raising her,2
nicholas is so cute if i went to prison i wanna go here haha hes so innocent,2
celine is so grateful and cute she wasn t complaining about the food and is pretty smart,2
i m so proud of celine parents they raised her right,2
do you ever eat with your hands never indians pakistaniessri lankans or any desi pal pathetic,0
well i grew up sleeping on bed lined with strawmat eating on the ground culture thing eating bugs because we didn t get meat that often and my generation was consider the lucky one because we got much more than previous ones these foods look just fine for me good variety,2
i love how at the end of the united arab emirates food clip it just shows celine eating the food with her hands like its no problem at all shes so precious,2
pls god i want a daughter just like celine she s adorable,2
this indian dude is reviving this series for me he s hilarious,2
nikhil is a perfect addition to the food wars cinematic universe dude is just funny af and super likable perfect compliment to joe who is also awesome,2
petition for joe and i to the next episode lying down on the table,1
the exgirlfriend joke the lying down on the table few minutes in and it s already an experience,1
i had a professor from india and every time the department would order catering he would complain about the vegetarian option with good reason it looked nowhere near as good as the vegetarian option in india,0
food insider hit the jackpot with nikhil as the host for indian food he does a really good job i have one request and that is that you dont waste food by throwing it out after taking just one bite and instead cut off a piece from where you took the bite and offer it to someone who doesnt have food itll make that persons day and you wouldnt lose a thing,2
i can see how this would be a western option nice bland easy on the palate broooo lol if you flavor something we are buying at a restaurant with salt pepper we call that a rip off it needs at least spices lmaoooo i feel that though,1
i remember getting in line for a subway at delhi int airport there was a line of say people of which were nonindians i was getting late and the line seemed huge i was also wondering why so many foreigners were eating vegetarian then one of them got in the front and the cashier told him that the nonveg line was on the other side and then they looked up and spotted that they were standing in the vegetarian line the entire queue moved and i got my sub in time for my flight fun times,2
chana is a smaller variety of chickpea whereas daldaal is called lentils in english that aside great video and i really love nikhils sense of humour and style of presentation,2
nikhil is crushing this series love him,2
josh you just recreated the medieval concept of a bagged lunch where you can eat the bag well done let the italians scream id be all right with getting all my fast food in a neapolitan style pie,2
this is a very good idea imagine getting like a calzone stuffed with grilled chicken an alfredo sauce possibly a garlic butter brushed on top of the calzone i m going to go make one rn,2
i gave my year old son the joshua weismann cookbook for easter i m a mom of grown males i use any excuse to gift my kids things he sends me recipes so i can shop them before he comes out to my house he didn t really cook before crackin your book he then brings the cookbook with him so we can cook meals togethersomething his older brother and i have done since he was four it s nice we will be doing some similar combos once he watches this videoguaranteed,2
watching your videos makes me want to cook but i think i ll just heat up some hot dogs,2
ive done a thanksgiving calzone before with leftovers it was bomb af ngl,2
josh if you are gonna be doing these kinds of mash ups might i suggest doing rice bowl versions of some previous makes like a quesoritto rice bowl or maybe a chic fil a rice bowl,1
hey josh i have been making a lot of your recipes recently it has been a blast this last weekend my family and i decided to fire up the woodfired pizza oven and make pizzas i finally was able to get over there the night before and made dough from scratch my god what a difference additionally i used your burger sauce recipe as the base for a borger za dough innout sauce mozzarella parmasian ground beef pickles onions it was sent from god thank you papa,2
one time i had leftover bbq pulled pork and leftover fettuccine in the fridge i mixed them together and baked it in the oven until crispy i know italians and texans were collectively losing their minds but it tasted freaking amazing so who cares,2
ive hated calzone until the day i made it by myself at home every time i tried calzone in a fast food restaurant the filling was like boiled inside and just blah i dont like it this way stopped ordering started cooking it,0
theres a pizzeria here in sweden that invented a calzone thats stuffed with a burger with bun with fries and everything guessing that it was invented by someone a bit drunk i want a pizza but a burger,1
id never make my own mozzarella too much responsibility desi is a level human being,0
want to see more of desi for sure he s relatable af they got a hundred different types of sauce at the store why d i make my own,2
im a level chief and i hope you guys like microwaved mozzarella sticks,1
the level chefs commentary is pure gold,2
the bounce back between level and were great love to see those two more,2

i simply love how this team is always revisiting countries they already done in the past and this ep is a vnoice surprise pancit palabok is my fav noodle dish and what was shown here is close enough maynila s take to palabok to what that humble and timeless dish is all about since most dishes including this one has numerous iterations spanning not just country wide but on a global scale now days keep it up y all,2
i love sonnys enthusiasm to eat unfamiliar foods he didnt show any grimace or fear of eating by the way we dont eat some of these foods everyday except for palabok lomi and pares some foods are normally eaten during feasts and parties to enjoy with other people i love how mr chui guides sonny on filipino dishes more power to your show,2

thank you so much for featuring the philippine cuisine i miss home due to pandemic it s been years since i last visited my native country watching this made me homesick and oh my i love the foood especially the pares,2
sunny is really trying out the food of the world the ones that people are afraid to try yet sunny shows how people eat around the world and still live best food program ever i think i have seen literally every single video,2
filipino food is really sinful absolutely hearty filling and delicious,2
i love this collab congrats paps for being a part of this watching this makes me quite nostalgic on my student day in manila because of the pares and the palabok,2
we had a blast shooting this series what kfc exclusive do you want the most,2
the india exclusive krushers that were discontinued just a few months back were really delicious they should bring that stuff back,2
glad that you included india in this series during the lockdown my wife and i used to enjoy a kfc drive through a bit too often in the uk love from uk,2
i love how nikhil is just being the best when it comes to explaining vegetarianism in indialike we dont need a veg biriyaniwho even invented them,2
as someone who is following channels like buzzfeed tasty food insider and many more channels who review food of india vs other countries since ill have to agree that i genuinely enjoyed this video the editing the humour the variety everything is just so indulging and fun to watch rather than your average countless food comparison videos which feel like theyre all the same this was refreshing to watch kudos looking forward to more of this content,2
welcome nikhil can t wait to learn more from you about all that delicious indian fast food,2
our smallest is bigger than their largest and we took it personally,1
choco mud pie mousse cake these two are so common across all the indian fast food chains dominos has these burger king has these even macdonalds india have these or if not one of these are bound to be there,1
you should check out kenyas kfc its wild we have a bucket with and pcs chicken wraps called twisters my fav is the spicy rice bowl hash brown burgers nyama nyama burgers which is a burger without bunsbuns are chicken pieces instead chicken nuggets krushers which is a milkshake with crushed cookies i like mine with oreos box master and crunch master which is like a shawarma and lastly kfc chicken saladi almost forgot the double crusher burger with pieces of chicken im now hungry,2
i love this nikhil guy more of him please,2
yes dinner and dancing at lotte mart this is the kind of episode i ve been missing less gold leaf on caviar more and asian grocery stores,2
watching strictly dumpling while eating my dinner is the most luxurious part of my day honestly feels like i m eating with mikey,2
having dinner and watching mikey after a busy college day i was just wondering why do i like these asian groceries stores videos so much its amazing the variety of pre made meals and frozen food they have everything look so good and mikey said some of them are like eating from a restaurant impressive really,2
you are making me want to go to south korea more now mike if even supermarket food is that good over there how can i resist,2
thats like eating out of a restaurant thats because restaurants freeze their foods like their fresh pasta too haha its good to see a video thats more down to earth than the constant expensive places,2
ive always wanted to try this in asia but havent gotten the chance to since i started doing this after the pandemic but next chance i get i m going for sure and doing a whole day there thanks for even more inspiration mike you re the best,2
they all looked great and delicious i love dim sum and cooked some up today some of the dumplings that i never have had were the soup dumplings omg they are absolutely awesome and delicious cheers mikey another great video,2
i found those churro chips in a local h mart and they are seriously addicting had to stop myself before eating the whole bag right after opening it,2
the korean orion new four layers turtle chip corn soup flavor and the chocolate churro flavor are simply the best so glad it was showcased here for more people to know about how good it is,2
i love these types of videos all that pre made and frozen food looks and i can only imagine how good it is thank you mike,2
i love how he doesn t talk or make unnecessary faceshe just eats,2
i like when asmr channels never include the cooking and straight to the eating but this channel is still always good,2
this guy is by far the absolute best mukbanger ive ever listened to ever,2
i love that this guy always smiles and he enjoys what he is doing,2
it looks like zach is living his best life and is happy when eat i have so relatable,2
when is this man gonna get sponsored by sprite already,1
mozzarella corn dog onion rings chicken nuggets hashbrowns alfredo sauce sprite drink,1
all that food looks delicious,2
first video im seeing and i would love to eat what he cooks already looks good,2
watching him cook is so satisfying,2
as a fellow immigrant to korea whos now living in vietnam i have to agree with these judgments especially how lotteria chefs took a quick look at a burger and tried to recreate it off sight alone the only thing id add is that the mozzarella sticks at lotteria are the best ive had from any restaurant over here,2
lol omfg all this time i also thought lotteria was korean my bad,0
this is why english teachers are high in demand im dead,2
man you put on the funniest food show on youtube love your content,2
putting sliced sausages in the tomato sauce with spaghetti is actually pretty common in several countries most of south america would find it normal,1
just wanna tell you guys keep going your show is entertaining educating and fun to watch you guys are living my dream props and rock on,2
you should try the big tasty from mcdonald s in the uk when you get a chance and if it s available honestly it s heaven and the chicken legend is exclusive to the uk,2
this is not just a food review channel this is a cultural documentary that makes me appreciate our planet and i will support this channel till im an old woman,2
i love the fact he feels so guilty about the cheese chicken im half expecting a unplanned fkn delicious video where calvin turns up at sonnys house and spots him eating it through the window for sonny to panic that his secret was exposed,1
love this show sonny you rock brother one of the best shows on youtube keep doing what you do,2
mark you found the right guy to bring you around kf seetoh is a legend in singapore,2
yummy street food i like those foods,2
for those who dont know kf seetoh is a legendary street food critic in singapore he has really shine light on the traditional cooking methods and food culture and guided the likes of anthony bourdain etc through his long career i also personally respect that he does not put on airs or care about visuals the way other singaporean food influencers do he really cares about the food edited for grammar,2
incredible job on that video he is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry i think you found the right man to introduce singapore hawker food i saved almost on my flights using mighty travels premium,2
this gentleman seetoh made this video a delight usually i watch everything you do expecting your take on certain foods this man had amazing knowledge of expressly singaporian dishesand it was extraordinary thank you,2
love the fact that hes able to give us the history behind all the singapore favorites he was also a friend of anthony bourdain if you bourdain fans may recall,2
such a joy to watch kf seetoh his passion for the local food scene the way he celebrates the hawkers and food stall owners couldnt stop smiling the entire video was touching love the guy,2
glad that mark chose to work with seetoh someone who has lived the s s someone who has tasted and knows how authentic singapore streethawker food in the s s were like and how they were authentically prepared and the ingredients originally used in that erathings that young people wouldnt know,2
as a singaporean im so glad to see kf seetoh introduce all the food in less wellknown not the chinatown complex hong lim or golden mile hawker centres thats locally loved,2
i love how uncle seetoh just goes in the stalls like nobodys business because hes a living legend xd,2
thank you very much for giving me this precious opportunity i m really honored to work with you amazing food war s team arigatou gozaimasu and i m looking forward to watching new food wars us vs india episodes,2
george is just living his best life in this episode lol joe looks like he s grounded while all his friends are out playing,2
so apparently the japanese elevens are like mini togo restaurants while the ones in the us serve packaged processed food or reheated frozen processed garbage its almost an insult to call them the same store how do we let them get away with this crap here,0
i dont think ive ever seen such a stark difference in selection and quality on a food wars ep before lol,1
theres no comparison between us elevens and the in asia dramatic difference on quality of food and service for ppl who live in the us and want to experience the asia s go to hawaii s are run by different companies in asia which explains the significant difference as an american i barely go to except if i need a drink food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk high or dont care,0
it seems in this series that george enjoys what he eats way more than joe does,2
i m upset that japan s has actual proper food where we have nothing but junk food anyways i m excited that you guys are branching out to india,2
me as a european am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the us how can the smallest soda be ml that would in the netherlands be enough for the entire family i mean in japan they have l and liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share they arent portion sized,0
the japanese chocolate doughnut looks much better than the one you d get in america or here in the uk,2
george is always saying how yummy everything was so when he said it tastes like st i almost fell off my chair lmfao,2
who will go here to enjoy the food and claim the free drink thanks for watching please also follow my youtube channel to see great food pictures,2
o br simplesmente meteu um churrasquinho de gato em los angeles brabo apenas,1
never try brazilian food before it looks yummy,2
i ve never eaten brazilian food before that place looks legit the food looks fabulous,2
i already went to eat in this restaurant spectacular food and very delicious dessert i recommend,2
wow the dessert was the best i have ever tasted in my life very good perfect i loved it,2
oh my it is incredible that is street food looks so yummy,2
everything looked insanely delicious give me some safe journey cholula,2
my wife and i eat the candy every sunday i highly recommend it it is wonderful,2
it s awesome to know there is a brazilian street food as i love brazilian bbq,2
can we please put this to rest mooshelle has udders chase no udders as far as weve seen,1
i cant explain exactly why this has become one of my favourite formats on the show but it really has i can never get enough of these,2
mooshelle was really sucking it in for that fancy pants dance with chase,0
i started thinking that moochelle looked like chase this episode then rhett said chase isnt moochelle and then chase and moochelle danced together so im glad we put that to rest so efficiently and definitively,2
the fact that rhett doesn t like big shrimp then proceeds to choose it at the end makes me laugh he knew it was fancy,1
honestly nothing has tempted me into joining the mythical society until the counseling session teaser,1
that therapist is a true professional to be able to hold it together with someone intentionally being like randy and treating it like any other session is admirable,2
i am interested to see this series done by adding a mythical kitchen version into the mix,2
at this point we need an episode of what link eats in a week because i m convinced he doesn t eat anything with flavor or seasonings like a toddler,0
i was really hoping for my favorite app potato skins but maybe a whole potato based episode would be good potato skins poutine mashed potatoes etc,2
huge thank you to ali for making this trip possible follow him on ig alinhamdani get early access to videos and be the first to comment follow on instagram for more fun food videos besteverfoodreviewshow,2
pakistan is a wonderful country and pakistanis are great people love from azerbaijan to our brothers,2
i became teary when they all gathered to eat the smile joy on their faces the sight of the food and the beautiful landscape all gave me goosebumps i love food and beautiful people,2
this aint a youtube video this is a wholeass documentary kudos to sonny ali the community they visited here and the whole team behind the cameras,2
as a hunzai i enjoyed every second of this video and i cant put my gratitude in words because im short of them we love you sonny and all of these kind commenters,2
i love sonny but his editors are on a whole another level the way the music footages and everything comes together is just an amazing symphony of perfection,2
pakistan looks like a such a beautiful place would love to go there one day and experience it for myself,2
thoroughly enjoying these videos of northern pakistan as a tibetan its incredible to see people from a similar landscape background and region its unfortunate i cannot visit my motherland tibet but i am vicariously living through your videos interesting fact yak is the national animal of the tibet keep the videos coming,2
damn im pakistani and ive been to pakistan not the northern part though this series has got me excited for when i travel there next time thank you for being so respectful sonny youve got a subscriber for life d i love our culture food dresses and our land the way you and your team portrayed it is beautiful,2
that s amazing way of cooking cheers from ireland,2
whack that like button and i won t fire manny today,0
gordon ramsay should eat like nick for an entire day,1
it s so heart warming to see nick bring small time cooks like gordon to big time cooking,2
imagine being gordon ramsays son or daughter and walking into the kitchen seeing him making some food at in the morning and you ask him dad what are you doing oh im just making a snack the next thing you know hes whipping out his beef wellington,1
oh damn i never realized hell s kitchen is his actual restaurant no wonder he gets so pissed when people absolutely destroy expensive food that s his baby,0
as a uk citizen for or years the curry sauce with the fish and chips is definitely traditional my entire family loves it,2
its really good to see nick helping out small chefs like gordon ramsey the community appreciates it nick,2
thank you for supporting small businesses in these hard times you rock,2
can we respect that nick constantly shows himself eating crab and lobster despite being allergic to shellfish what a goat,0
the mashup of different pop all mixed together is called swamp water long time ago it was specifically coke and orange pop but has transformed to refer to basically a mix of different pops of random assortment it actually works well and is a go to for when i want something fun and youthful,2
hey mark i really love all of your videos but this whole spain series is definitely your greatest work as of today in my opinion i actually built my holiday around some of the spots you visited during this trip keep up the great work you really inspire a lot of people cheers,2
mark you are the reason i will be putting spain as a place to visit and eat at after this amazing food tour you have done this far every place you have showed us on your tour looks just absolutely amazing and stunning the ambiance and the energy of these chefs is just outstanding also the quality of the ingredients and the recipes they have shared with you is just mouth watering spain is now on my bucket list thank you for showing your experience there i am excited to see what is next,2
gabriella san sebastien is obsessed with raw ingredients and how they prepare them spot on food seems so simple when you look at it that waybut so few do gabriella has been another perfect foil on your spanish tour these outstanding people youve worked with across spain have taken everything to a genuinely jawdropping level i love the format working with people who are as passionate about food as you and they simply take you to their favourite food spots genius im totally loving merrihue being with you nowill feel rather sad the next time hes not by your side in a video loving your work mark,2
what i love about italy spain is the simplicity of preparing their food allowing the natural taste of the food to shine through in america we overcook over prepare our food the freshness of this food makes you feel like you never had true prepared food mark this is what sharing food is really about in your own words wow cant help but to appreciate you your show,2
hands down gabriella is one of if not the best tour guide in marks channel she knows everything not just about the food but also the city of san sebastian,2
would love to travel the and eat food like mark his love for food and the culture and stories behind the dishes absolutely beautiful,2
the genius of mark s videos is his ability to take deep dives into countries and truly convey his experience after seeing james blick here i got hooked on his vlog just like i how i found joel s and jlj s vlog don t change anything mark don t go cable network or public television just keep doing what you do,2
im so glad to see reviews on food from spain i never knew anything about spanish food besides for western world spanish food like mexico to brazil i never was even interested i looking at spain as a food destination and now its definitely on my food bucket list so glad ive saved all the videos so if i ever go i can look book and plan a trip thanks mark and jeff and a big thanks to all of your guides on this trip im sure alot of these places would never be found easily,2
el mejor sitio del mundo para comeri love san sebasti n,2
im having a really tough time at the moment and seeing marks passion energy and enthusiasm has honestly made me smile so thank you very much,2
i love you guyss videos keep up the awesome work,2
your videos are so cool and your doing an great gob keep it up well done,2
i love that the big chopsticks were drum sticks and the small ones were tooth picks,2
can we move to the fact that the girl with yellow hair looks like a minion,1
i love this video and my daughter loves this video,2
hi i love your videos keep up the good work,2
nice i love go troom troom every one,2
i like the way that she eats,2
i love go theyre so amazing and subscribe,2
i feel healthy watching him eat all that stuff,2
im constantly surprised by how well matt actually cooks but then i remember that dont really make your life revolve around something without learning a thing or two,1
i love how it took more time for him to eat popcorn than a whole entire chocolate cake,2
the thing that i love about him is he doesn t waste food and his thumbnails are real,2
this was first video i watched from matt and i remember thinking no way hes gonna eat the whole cake then i watched him more and realized whole cake was a piece of cake for him,1
i wonder if he has ever bite his fingers while eating so fast,1
imagine inviting matt to dinner and he puts on the timer,1
my old time favorite video from matt stonie thank you matt stonie for the entertainment of competitive eating,2
matt stonie eats everything incredibly fast also matt stonie enjoys his icecream,2
this is a delicious idea also his gf watching him like alsoalso imagine hearing him eat with no music or background noise for an entire filming session,2
this owner was one of the only one that i was on his side the whole time he was not egotistic not in denial accepts all the criticisms and opened to change he needs to be saved,2
i love how his son let his dad rage at him knowing he needed to do it and being proud that he did it,2
i ate here as a kid before during and after the filming of this episode my dad is vegan so we went here often the food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with he was always super nice you could imagine my surprise when i got older and saw this episode lol i never saw gordon ramsay but i saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast the potato pancake was my favorite on the menu its a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists,2
this man is a very gentle soul its hard for him to get angry,2
this is a really good episode lots of great moments the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed the owner eating the plants straight from the pot a fun time,2
so wonderful to see that guy love his dad so much that he wasnt even disturbed with his dad yelling at him recognised that it was apart of his dads growth as a manager and got so excited by it happening,2
the owner in this episode is such a sweetheart bless his heart its sad that some of his staff take advantage of that im so glad gordon came to help and i hope they clean up their act and kick it into gear i really hope that after gordon leaves that dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves to be completely honest the cook showed promise but he didnt show up half of the time when he needed to and didnt listen to dean and wants to say dean is a bad manthats ridiculous dean put up with orelio cookchef thinking he can do what he wants mainly deans own fault and so now that is what he expects i would have fired his ass a long time ago,1
the son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful i really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well,2
i would literally eat here the owner was so respectful you could tell he has a big heart and willing to do what he can to improve the restaurant hes definitely not arrogant and takes criticism well,2
the owner is so down to earth humble and nice if this is my boss i would literally work longer in that restaurant,2
i respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best piece that ive ever seen on youtube hats off to you all love your videos,2
i love how preston is for kids but has adult jokes in it,2
preston is type of guy who creates clickbait titles and clickbait thumbnails but the video ends up actually being what the title and thumbnail say so extra awesome points to him,2
the reason the unsalted fries are fresher is because no one orders them without salt so they have to make a new batch,1
for me milk actually makes it x spicier even if im not eating something spicy just regular pasta burns my throat with milk,2
the egg blew my mind we did some great research preston,2
the cotton candy myth is based on how big your cup and how much water it isso technically it s infinite,1
for any secret menu you have to know what the parts of the item you want is,1
the reason it feels spicier when you drink water is because the water makes the spice spread around your mouth,2
the one about catching more food or not by sticking your tongue out is really gonna teach those women how to do it right,1
attention food wishers scam alert i have no other account names on youtube and do not offer any prizes or special deals unless the message is from this account its not me do not fall for scams by people using a similar name thank you,0
chef john always coming through with the best stoner food,2
im going to comment this on every potato video to simplify the destarching of your potato whether its for chips fries hash browns or whatever use a solidbottom salad spinner fill it with water swish your potato pieces lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until its clear then dump the water and spin the potatoes you will get them super dry in just a minute then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel but this will save you paper towels because they will be dry of course there is no reason you must use my technique after all you are the johnny depp of your potato prep enjoy,1
i have been coming back chef johns recipes then and again for years theres always great nuggets of advice and reasons to chuckle in these videos thank you once again chef,2
i m allergic to sunflower seeds and most storebought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil so this opens up my life to potato chips thank you chef john,2
the only problem is avoiding eating the first batch while the second cooks i place my chips on parchment without the dinner plate i also toss them in oil without rinsing them my w microwave takes minutes per batch also you can get a variance of with the time required depending on the potato itself always keep an eye on it and never assume the time will be the same,1
chef john from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave the man does it all,2
i had to come back to say this works great i used olive oil spray though and lawrys season salt but same result very crunchy only minutes in my micro so as chef john said watch them because everyones micro is different also kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round but i think i did one too many folds because i ended up with parchment paper circles attached together,2
these look amazing i hate the fact that store bought crisps im watching from the uk or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling i guess thanks for sharing,2
for years now i have had this overwhelming frustration when watching chef johns videosi just wanna give em more than one thumbs up such a legend,1
omg can we take a moment and say i am so impressed with how she takes care of her teeth while eating so much candy,2
i love how she always wears the same themed hair makeup and clothes i love it,2
this is very relaxing and looks tasty,2
i love how she whispers it sounds like really cool and i love how she match the candy,2
she does asmr amazing,2

lets just take a moment to appreciate the time that hunni takes to do her makeup and to find purple clothes,2
i really love these videos you make me relax and lay down in my bed lol,2
rip to all those who watched this while hungry,1
i mean the fact that im hungry and still decided to watch these and make myself even more hungry,0
yes i should be asleep right now yes i am starving,0
agony of watching this when youre the only snack in the house,1
love this it really makes me hungry looking at those delicious dishes,2
im just upset because they dont tell me where the hell these places are,0
eyessatisfied ears nice music stomachnot at all satisfied,1
dios mio que deliciaaa es incre ble todo lo que podemos lograr en la cocina se me hizo agua la boca,2
yes im starving yes im sleepy yes its my choice if i wanna sleep but im fasting dude,0
incr vel hummm parece delicioso,2
i got a challenge for you erik calories of every part of the food pyramid and each flavor like sweet salty spicy savory that kind of deal,1
an epic effort with all the donations to the food bank true class act erik,2
i just love watching erik eat an entire buffet while i eat my regular ass lunch,2
erik youre a certified nut but i absolutely love it the surprise at the end absolutely warmed my heart you are such an incredible person keep spreading the love,2
pringle s and caviar do love the donation to the food bank that s awesome and i know you helped a lot of people with your generosity,2
let s appreciate the fact erik goes so above and beyond with videos like this keep up the amazing content,2
the quality of your videos has always been good but lately theyve been next level plus youre showing your sense of humor recently too just an all around good time,2
good for you class act human being right here challenge or no challenge donating to food banks especially how much you did is awesome,2
the editing and performance in this video is through the roof absolutely insane,2
mr beast laughing in the distance while eating in one bite,1
honestly your pink sauce looks good can i buy a bottle,2
from a home cook perspective a lot of this makes sense seasoning mayo tastes nice and is easy to do which makes up for its short shelf life the dragon fruit is novel but also tasteless that makes the taste of the official product worrying makes you wonder if everything has just gone off,1
the gov t must order her to stop the sale of this immediately especially if it s that perishable and not shipped properly,0
the fact that she doesnt even know what fda stands for along with how its all packaged the list could go on shows that this is obviously not safe,0
me and my parents literally have a recipe for a sauce that looks like a pale version of the pink sauce weve been using it mainly for french fries and i love it so thanks i dont need to pay for this i can make it on my own and also it has probably less calories in it,2
im honestly quite confused why she hasnt been taken to court yet she has a nutrition facts that make no sense,0
if matpat keeps making foods from viral tiktoks that ended up being at best acceptable imagine if tiktok showing a recipe for something called if matpat drinks this he will literally explode juice goes viral,1
matpats been able to solve so many mysteries but can he solve the mystery of the missing sock in,1
it s always absolutely delightful or even delicious to see scammers get publicly called out,2
so glad youre covering this people need to quit wasting their money on this sauce its dangerous and i dont feel sorry for anyone who buys it weve been warned so many times now but with a big youtuber like you talking about it it helps get the word out not to mention we could start making our own,1

sonny and his team are out here doing reviews no one else would dare to do it really shows his dedication and hard work,2
,1
as a tanzanian from the chagga tribe myself i am incredibly grateful for your generosity and how respectful you are of everyones culture keep doing what you do,2
i can definitely see how this regions heritage and lifestyle has influenced the caribbean especially jamaica i really enjoyed this episode,2
the host is absolutely so kind loved the hospitality they showed to our sonny and team,2
the producers are so good at finding people from a location who are excellent cultural ambassadors for their country city village or tribe sonny has a knack for crosscultural communication but the individuals and families that host him at their tables are remarkable people,2
as a chagga that s living abroad at the moment you best believe i almost cried when i saw mbege i miss it and him eating machalari it s literally my favorite dish from home i watch your videos and i was definitely happy to see this particular video from you sonny,2
if you are from the caribbean or grew up there you see clearly where our cuisine comes from and our roots,1
loving our neighbor s cuisines much love from,2
omg i wish i could visit there one day,2
we got to give credit to the cohost she s very enthusiastic and fun to watch her punchlines were not bad at all kudos,2
this is so awesome in puerto rico we call a pig roast over a fire lechon the legs of animals pata and fried skins chicharon too ive gotta visit the philippines at least ones id feel right at home,2
i like her as a co host please have aling on more episodes because i enjoy her self confidence and shes up to trying the questionable gleck you sometimes eat without too many qualms about it,2
philipino cuisine is criminally underrated i m mexican american from so california and believe it or not i went my first years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunt s filipina coworkers wasn t until i started dating a half filipina half white girl i first got to try it at a legit restaurant i absolutely loved everything my family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when i realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment i felt like i found my long lost relatives haha that alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal halohalo are you kidding me filipinos that is crack cocaine in dessert form and everything else all of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro i love my mexican food and while i wouldn t ever trade it for anything filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion,2
nice to see you back in the philippines enjoying trying filipino dishes sonny,2
sonny you should try the adobo version of cooked frogs with tons of red small chili and garlic prepared by our very own locals its delicious,2
i love that philipibes reminds me of my coubtry mexico the crickets here in mexico are prepared deliciously as well,2
this man is the man he has more knowledge about filipino food than my fellow filipinoa whos in this video edit wala naman po ako sinabing pangit kay ate gurl pinuri ko lang yung vlogger haha,2
the side dish is called smoked shotgun shells its been super popular for the last couple of years on a lot of bbq channels and at bbq competitions,2
guga needs to have december simply be a best of month where he spends an entire month redoing some of his easier best experiments and comparing what the best experiments of the year were i would love that,2
judging by angel and leos reactions it seems like gugas cooking just gets better and better every video,2
that movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called butter salt brand name flavicol the compounds that give butter it s buttery taste can be made artificially or extracted from actual butter then mixed with salt as a powder this is then mixed with oil and that s what movie theaters use you should dry age with the pure flavicol powder i bet that d be incredible,2
has anyone mentioned that this bbq sauce looks fantastic will you tell us how you made it guga,2
hey guga we know that dry brining steak is actually good so what if try dry aged steak using garlic powder and black pepper and lets see if it will work and will taste much better,2
popcorn oil is amazing i used to work at a movie theater and we d pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper one day i added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing perfect golden color savory delicious people complimented how good the popcorn was i became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn one day i showed a coworker my secret and he thought if pumps of oil is better than then must be amazing we received so many complaints over his oily popcorn had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags the lesson a little oil goes a long way don t overdo it with that stuff,2
the juxtaposition between angel and leos reactions is hilarious leo the juices themselves you get from the steak are creamier its a little bit more savory its a little bit rich whatever you did to it enhanced the flavors of the steak and made it an overall better experience i love this angel the second one had a urgh you know like its like urgh its like urgh you know its like uurrgh,2
a thought hit me recently we need a guga meatloaf i can just imagine how amazing that would be whether with waygu or regular beef i think it would be an awesome experiment,2
so i can confirm we are all laying in our bed in the middle of the night starving,1
fun fact some people are not watching for the asmr sounds they are just watching for getting their stomach full,1
pov it s ramadan and you re hungry,1
does anyone else just love the sound of the food as she sets it down,2
time stamps intro drink onion rings chicken drum stick chicken breast chicken drum stick cajun fries chicken sandwich onion rings cajun fries chicken sandwich biscuit drink chicken drum stick strawberry pie outro don t forget brush youre teeth plug in youre phone set an alarm turn off the lights blow out the candels lock the doors pack youre bag have a good night enjoy the time,1
binge watching people s mukbang during quarantine,1
love this so much look so delicious,2
que rico todo me encanta saludos desde espa a,2
this was actually the first video that i watched of hunniebee and it was just awesome now i love her videos,2
what a delicious food i love this kind of food,2
in ww when the americans liberated the concentration camp saintcyprien located in france the american troops wanted to feed the newly freed camp prisoners because they have been starving without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food literally seconds after liberating them the soldiers thinking it was the right thing started giving the prisoners apples sandwiches and even chocolates leading to a lot of prisoners dying after that incident the science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the medical staff feed them first it was mostly a slow input of light soup,0
the fact that jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes hes really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people,2
there s a story on youtube about a crew of japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food they were eventually rescued by an american ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate making sure they only ate small amounts of soup ship captains in the s clearly knew how to deal with starvation and it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost,0
one could say gordans food is to die for,0
my grandmother told me this story were from the philippines and during the end of wwii during and at the exit of the japanese occupation the us military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food one of my grandmothers neighbors a young boy picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies he dropped dead moments after at the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome,0
i just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with anorexia nervosa i appreciate you mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them,2
slight correction pretty sure gordan didnt know mrbeast was fasting until he literally started cooking for him he probably would not have even started cooking if he knew by the time he started he definitely has the pride of a chef to have his target audience enjoy his food,1
just a quick correction there jimmy did do it for the content but he stated in the comments it was also because he has crohns disease which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation he wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation,0
i was in a pretty bad accident when i was younger spent about weeks in icu hooked up to a nutrients iv and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed i still remember the first time i tried to eat solid food after that it was a little microwave kraft dinner cup i took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed i havent really been able to eat plain kd since then,0
this is probably my favourite food theory video to date this information could save lives of people who fast whether voluntarily or not as someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food i really appreciate this information there had been times in which i went a few days without food only to try and stuff myself i only ever felt sick and knowing its my bodys natural response is a huge perspective change,2

looks great the bakery where i work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins for dairy we use sour cream rather than milkbuttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla but otherwise very similar someone has maybe already commented this but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo,2
you can try coating the berries with flour before you mix them in the flour coating on them slows down how fast they fall to the bottom of the pan the same goes for things like chocolate chips,1
its a common trick in a lot of baking circles to toss the fresh fruit with a little bit of flour before stirring in the fruit to your baked item so for a pound of blueberries perhaps toss them together with about two tablespoons of flour which should keep them suspended in the batter as it bakes,1
i m upset about other things in my life and i m still confident that i would love these and not complain about blueberry placement,2
perfect timing we have two blueberry bushes that give us about gallons of blueberries every summer tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks cant wait to try this recipe,2
this looks so delicious cant wait to try it,2
ive heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter,2
i call the sweet style cornbread breakfast cornbread cause when its paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast im gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch,2
looks delicious ive got a recipe for strawberry cornmeal cake and i add the strawberries last and gently swirl them into the batter thats already in the pan to keep them suspended incake that being said i also love cobbler so i dont have a problem with blue bottom cornbread either,2
im really impressed by how clean your oven looks and of course your blueberry cornbread which looks heavenly cant wait to try this recipe,2
when he said his family couldnt afford the drinks in a packet when he was a kid and now hes travelling all over the world and has everything he likes i felt so good you have come a long way mikey cheers to you,2
omg yesss another eleven vid these are my fave,2
when mike nods his head yes and no at the same time you know it s good,2
living in the uk i m always envious when i see these kind of convenience store videos i would love that amount of choice in a store near me,2
i originally started watching your channel because of your eleven vending machine japan episodes so happy to see more eleven content i don t know why but they fascinate me,2
mike enjoying korean convenience store food more than disney usa priceless,2
i always come to your channel when im having a bad anxiety ridden day it helps me relax and its truly entertaining thank you,2
i always always wish we had convenience store food like this with the same price,1
seeing mike actually struggling with a spicy dish is slightly mindblowing,1
this guy is so relaxing to watch ngl just hop into bed turn this guy on and drift off to sleep watchin this guy eat,2
check out spizee the new guy,1
i love how he pours the whole bottle and says that s enough,2
those spicy pickles looked good i might have to try that,2
i love how the spicy cereal guy poured the whole bottle of source then said that s enough,2
it always makes me hungry when i watch these kind of videos,1
i love how rami is mostly the honest one when it comes to no reaction,2
i love how the ramen noodles man is just getting everything in his eye,2
my mexican mom serves me a plate of spicy food me takes a bite this is spicy my mom wdym it s not spicy also my mom does not react to the food,0
i like how the only thing spicy is what they make themselves,2
couldn t stop laughing,2
man this guy literally has the strongest stomach i would pass,1
i love the fact that hes so respectful and willing to be open minded on others cultures,2
great video as always you make minutes seem like minutes by being so entertaining and informative,2
it really rubs me the wrong way when people try and serve something they won t even eat no need to be sensational suny you always do such an amazing job dealing with all types of situations you find yourself in great video,2
when my youngest sister was about a month or so away from having her first child i told her that the hospital takes the placenta and will make something like spaghetti or lasagna and thats the first meal after her baby was born she kinda freaked out when they brought her a bowl of spaghetti im such a mean brother,0
nothing sonny tries shocks me anymore lol i mean drinking raw blood and eating a fish alive great content as usual,2
its really interesting that you said that placentas texture is very mushroomlike because theres a really good manga that featured evil babies that grew out their placentas into fake mushrooms so they could mind control the hospital staff by feeding them the placentashrooms makes you wonder if junji ito ate placenta before,2
in my hometown in vi t nam when i was a child we raised cows and we also ate placenta it was not an everyday treat and in my opinion it is a delicious delicacy so fascinating to see some thai folks enjoy it as well,2
with the combination of animals organs countries and styles of cooking i love how sonny would never run out of content like this,2
i love how you can put a literal feet tall stick in a freezer at home,2
the watermelon jello looks so delicious,2
the more i watch minutes the more i feel its only meant for being watched,1
i always love your videos since i was a kid,2
i love the videos keep it up,2
i love those stuff you made keep up the good work,2
meni se svi a,1
good job,2
your are very creative,2
i love this channel,2
i really enjoy the episodes where calvin appears hes just the perfect complement for you sonny your chemistry just makes the videos really interesting funny and enjoyable,2
been following your channel for the last years and i think calvin is probably your best cohost hes funny he knows how to make jokes and make fun of you lets keep him more on your show,2
that ladys face when sunny was about to sniff the fermented shrimp paste so adorable,2
i want more episodes with calvin and sonny i can see the best food bromance forming already and the humourvibe they created was really entertaining loved it,2
you guys are the perfect duo i absolutely love this show and calvin is so awesome,2
i had the pleasure of meeting calvin in person while in vietnam weeks ago he was eating and drinking with us and he s definitely a down to earth person with a humorous personality it would be awesome to meet sonny one day too,2
i never thought id type this sentence but as someone with a fear of snakes id actually try the snake intestine noodle dish this was really interesting thank you as always for the great content and calvin is awesome,2
i just love how sonny and calvin are just having a casual food conversation after the snake went and did its business all over sonnys shirt,2
i love calvin as a cohost i dont think hes done an episode with sonny without using the word gelatinous,2
i love how the family eats together,2
the beef brisket with the hot noodles look delicious,2
the food looks so delicious and it looks like the both of you are enjoying the meal thanks for another great video,2

shi h bhai mast video banata ho aap ak bar mera video bhi dakh ka batao ma kasi video banata huu bhai,1
im sorry but songbyrds husband really creeps me out lol and foodie beauty really sitting there passing gas and not caring how disgusting can you be no manners or self respect anyways i love your videos god bless,0
i love how respectful vox is even when hes talking about cringy moment edit thank you all for the likes,2
im sure foodie beauty is a lovely person foodie beauty is racist and xenophobic,0
what songbyrds husband eats kinda looks like bean soup we call it bableves in hungarian we just use a different type of bean its actually deliciousone of my fav soup,2
i dont understand how people can just fart while having a meal and just move on,0
no foodie beauty is a horrible human,0
the amount of effort you put into each and every video is so awesome i love your vids,2
foodie beauty is actually a terrible person and context behind that video is her cheat meal was at am while her boyfriend at the time got woken up by her and had to get ready she had eaten a salad and cottage cheese the night before i believe and while yes she ate it it wasn t fulfilling so she at this prebreakfast she genuinely is vile iykyk,0
we filipinos eat with our hands on some occasions and if we know how because not everyone does but there are limitations in what we can eat with our hands the idea of mushing mac and cheese between my fingers already make me squirm and it feels so wrong its like using chopsticks on spaghetti,0
i love that sammie boy has admitted the only reason his videos are like that is because he gets tons more views,2
follow me eating blue takis vs red cheetos please enjoy it vs,2
com certeza esse e um dos melhores canais de asmr sio voc e o melhor,2

everytime tzuyangnim post a video i need to have food with me so i wont feel hungry while watching her eats and this time i eat samyang and i eat it so fast that i dont even realize i stop eating before her thank you tzuyangnim and for everyone on behind the scenes too who works hard to keep on making all this video i really love it,2
convenience storebought food may be appetizing however there s still nothing that could ever beat homemade meals and even street food the way tzuyang eats and every single food on the table as if she could consume a lot lot more than that can be so satisfying to watch,2
this calls for another food everytime i watch tzuyang i always make sure theres a food present with me cant help not to crave for food when shes doing her thing,2
i m always amazed and mesmerized by your eating skills you are delightful,2
i was amazed seeing tzuyang used her left hand while using the chopsticks on most of her videos the chopsticks were on the right really a talented lady with an unbelievable appetite love everything about her,2
and she did it all by wearing a white shirt and not getting any stains on it im even more impressed,2
,1

i love tzuyang look when she s starving and has to waitit s almost like she s a little sad,2

dont click this if youre a kid,0
this channel really has motivated me to stay as far away from junk food as possible,2
thanks for being a lesson for millions of us you are just one person spreading a message to remain healthy without you knowing it may god bless you and keep you safe i weighed myself and on my way to touch lbs whenever i am about to lose my motivation i would at least watch you for a minute as a reminder,2
why did i genuinely smile when they were being nice to eachother and laughing together,2
i didn t go to the gym but then i found this guy and it changed,1
i come back and watch this every few days so i can remember to not stop working out so i dont end up like this man,1
let s be honest we all keep coming back just to see if this man is still alive,1
lets just take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into making us want to jump off a cliff,2
nick is in the prime position to have a body transformation and become a legend on the internet,2
lets just take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into making us want to jump off a cliff,2
theres something so disturbing about crystal and chuck other than neglecting evan,0
i feel like if songbyrd hadnt won things would not have been pleasant after filming i think he knows this because it seems like he couldve easily won,1
smh she has so much food aggression she could stand to share a raggedy fry there is no way id get an attitude with my husband over a fry,0
crystal always take those challenges so seriously,1
i remember when i tried to swallow a cheese stick whole damn near choked on the cheese i thought it was the end that being said ill never understand why crystal eatsraces like that with all the chewing difficulties she has,0
now i m positive that ketchup packet has been all over the floor and she s just lickin all over it,0
he literally let her win though he was jus sittin there staring,1
you can tell crystal doesn t have a life cause of how happy or mad she gets over the food races lmao,0
candy k always looks to me like shes being held captive or just been released,1
funny enough mukbangers claim viewers love to hear smacking yet any comments i read contain complete disdain for the sound never loved all the loud openmouthed heavy breathing is this vid,0

ssoyoung i should simply call you my appetizer you make me crave all your cookings i need a ssoyoung in my house to pamper me with all these delicacies,2
i like ssoyoungs mukbang not because of the food but because of the way she express her emotions,2
her expressions are so good her videos makes you feel like youre joining the meal,2
ssoyoung should open a restaurant where she sells food that she eats in her videos i would honestly eat there,2
the dialog and sounds of her just pouring a can of pop is what keeps me eating with ssoyoung whenever i get a chance,2

why i disappeared,0
when he took his hiatus i genuinely thought that nick was gonna finally take care of his health its a shame to see that nothings changed,0
you cant help someone who refuses to help themselves,0
you can just tell how hard hes trying to stay in character and relevant at this point its even more sad than before,0
i honestly thought he would have finally realized what he has done and turn his life around,1
nick is the only youtuber who can call me a peasant on camera and make me laugh abt it,2
who else thought he would come back in like a year skinny and normal and make a video about the importance of mental and physical health,1
please nikocado love yourself and take care of your health that is most important all this doesnt matter,2

lol love all the sibling love your relationship is such a gift not everyone gets to enjoy,2
can we all appreciate how ashley took so much time to edit just for us to get entertained thankyou ashleyy for the hard work,2
alexander siblings are the definition of siblings goals and im jealous of it,0
it feels so weird seeing everyone all grown up like andrews going to college the andrew siblings dynamic never gets old,1
this video is so comforting not only cuz its a sibling video but watching your food videos really help me and my struggle with eating and anyone out there who has the same troubles know you re not alone we can do this,2
the relationship ashley has with her siblings is honestly so funny and cute,2
laughed so hard when amber said her friend fell sleep at disneyland and she waited an hour for him to wake up and it was his best nap ever best friend award goes to her,2
a minute long sibling video with the cousins ashley is spoiling us,1
ahhh this video feels so nostalgic having the siblings and the cousins its always extra chaotic and extra dynamic with them,2

gongsam is a really neat and clean mukbanger and i really like this bout him and the way he shoots his video has a lots of effort in it and he also teaches us how to make that food while lots of mukbangers just start their video without showing any food recipe hats of to gong sam,2

my binge eating issues have been horrible lately i totally relate candy,0
ive recently tried pibb zero sugar and it is amazing if you like cherry flavored soda id definitely give it a try i do like the aw root beer zero sugar also tried it because you recommended it,2
im super late today candy having one of those lazy days those hotdogs tots and fries look amazing i dont eat hotdogs anymore but that doesnt mean i dont miss them and crave them love the color red on you and dark greens hair always looks so pretty and so shiny glad youre feeling better,2
candy if you are experiencing vaginal bleeding after menopause it is not normal it could be a sign of among other things endometrialuterine or cervical cancer get to the doctor now it could also be a sign of less serious things like fibroids polyps hormonal imbalances,0
hey candy good seeing you today i love a good hot dog we have a place here in raleigh called char grill and they make the absolute best hamburgers and hot dogs ever sending you huge hugs gf,2
that looks so delicious have a wonderful day,2
glad your back candy hope your taking more care of yourself grilled hot dogs are the best big beef ones are very tasty depends on the type and the brand,2
hearing what you said made me sad never think your worthless believe in yourself never let the opinions of others stop you or bring you down i suffer mental health issues and i feel this way about myself alot i hate seeing other people feeling the same because i know how bad it feels i pray you find strength in yourself x,0
love when you talk about you glad you are feeling a little better in yourself we all have our inner demons people who want to judge and bully say more about themselves than they do about you you are a sweet lady like i said i love hearing your stories i tell myself all the time get a grip of yourself i must do this i must do that when you are stuck at home all by yourself it s hard to motivate f the negative comments you don t need them i m sure there are more love than hate stay awesome,2
the snacks might take the edge off the addiction good job identifying that less is more,2

hey tee everything looks so good,2
food looks so good and you are an amazing mother and wife love watching your beautiful family and your eating videos,2
that cut from pams horrified expression at michaels doll scenario to the crossing the line video is so fantastically timedit kills me every time,0
this was arguably the offices funniest script yet what a barrage of awesome lines bj novak wrote this one,2
michael scott doesnt really change as much as some people say this season we as the audience just get to know him better and have a better understanding of what motivates his behavior kelly is the one who really changes that happens about or episodes in to season,1
kavin milf in background stanley laughing thats why the office is so unique when i re watch it i always look at the background to see what other characters are doing,2
excited for future episodes its gonna get better from here,2
i love how marketa felt that european joke her face just said goddamn it,2
pat is the target audience of this episode you can seem him laugh so hard to inappropriate jokes while literally asking suraj what is going on with some scenes,1
you would have done the same you just didn t think of it first such an underrated moment,1
can t wait when we get to the series finale and the intro will be a full blown rave for the normies,2
pat being hr pretty ironic,1
boruto reaction mashup list shippuden reaction mashup list,1
finalmente essa luta pica,2
tremenda pelea aunque estamos cada vez mas cerca de ese acontecimiento,1
boruto may not be the amazing written story of all time but when the story want it knows how to hype the fans,1
me encanta que suban video diario lo que siempre quize disfrutar del tiempo que dure,1
the animation gets me every time,2
the hype reaction of these reactors show how good boruto anime is despite the hate it received at its early seasons it definitely worth watching,2
excited for next eps,2
ah yes my young lord boruto proving minatos genes were passed to him how he used his vanishing rasengan so fast and still met up to hit that backflip and dodge saradas chidori tooo beautiful and my goat momo ugh,2
sarada using chidori is one of the best scenes in all boruto universe aaaaaaaaaaa,2
i can t even express or explain how legendary and outstanding the voice actor for thorfinn was in this episode that scream holy shit reminded me of erens screams in attack on titan definitely one of my favorite moments of anime so far it s literally his origin story now i m wondering if askeladd really wanted thors to be the leader was that laugh a change within the moment i m not sure but wow what an episode full uncut reaction to this reaction every reaction i upload on my patreon,2
the sad part is when askellad asked thors to be their leader he was actually serious but as he realized it was impossible he had to laugh it off to save face in front of his men,0
this show is about to pick up and you re gonna love these characters more and more as it goes nick,2
thorfinn screaming his lungs out saying he s going to kill them gives me the biggest chills because you can hear all the pain in his voice but at the same time you can hear how serious he is i can t want to see how he will accomplish this,0
a true warrior doesnt need a sword thors the troll one of the best lines in the series,2
nick how about you guys all attack him at once archers on the cliffs so anyway we started blasting,1
such a good episode thorfinn s voice reached all of us man,2
great reaction askeladd was actually serious about having thors becoming their leader but he said he was joking when he saw the disapproval on his face,2
thorfinns scream gets me every time the amount of emotion that was put into it just blew me away,2
season of vinland saga is one of the best first seasons of anime ever and season coming out in the beginning of next year is going to be even better truly excited to see your upcoming reactions for this masterpiece of a tale,2
now this is a try not to laugh challenge actually funny clips one after another after another tyrone straining and struggling not to laugh a real ab workout,2
i dont always agree with them but they are hilarious,2
we need more hodgetwins try not to laughs,1
i didn t even try i just needed a good laugh today and this was perfect,2
if it was try not to smile you wouldve been finished right away,1
i gotta hand it to you tyrone i dont know how you didnt break this time around you had some strong willpower there,1
i only lost cause tyrone was looking like his whole face was gonna explode holding that in,0
their faces its so funny to see buffed up dudes talking like that and just joking around,2
if kevin was my brother bruh we throwing hands at least times a day,1
this was hard but i made it kevin saying supplement wrong numerous times took everything from me idk why that part was so funny to me,2
women may have brought men into the world but you guys still need men to even make that happen a baby doesn t just appear in you from nothing,1
i have a year old son he has had two falling outs in his life both times they cussed each other took a little time apart and eventually made up and became bros again i have a year old daughter ive lost count of her falling outs and those girls are dead to her half the women my wife considers friends she comes home from hanging out with them and just rags them to obliteration to me,0
as a male rn who worked with almost all women bill is right on,2
if you could support the wnba like you support a fat chick thats proud of her body and no longer a threat to you that is a perfectly savage line showing bills genius,1
we brought you into this world nope my mother did and i respect her for this but i refuse to respect someone based on their gender or race or anything else other than your behaviour and character,0
speaking only from my experience as a year old man most of the guys i knew in highschool are all still friends pretty much all the girls hate each other two women will stare daggers at each other because the other one wore the same color as her two guys can get into a fist fight and if the right song comes on the jukebox they become best friends and spend the rest of the night drinking and talking about music,0
i know your joking but you couldnt produce us without us guys planting the seed thanks for being real,1
i am grateful for the woman that brought me into this world not only that she loved me and supported me in ways no one would she went above and beyond while others have been one disappointment after another i owe her everything and i help her out whenever she asked but the thing is only one woman brought me into this world and that credit does not roll over to the rest of the gender,2
okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that im french and theres an interesting fact about france its that we are brutally honest most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty when we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions youre probably wondering where im going with that well i was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and i cant relate at all because it doesnt work like that here i still know a lot of female who were already friend in high school and im whenever i see my mother or my girlfriend or my girl friends they are just friendly i dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time i saw in tv shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something i never saw in france they bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same so i was wondering why is that why are they still friends if its different for others then i realized because we are honest my female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say wow girl you look like shit today didnt you put on weight recently maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship why does american males manage to stay friends because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things why cant female american stay friends because they are sneaky they lie ooooh you look gorgeous girl you are so strong i envy you while not thinking any of that sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty,0
i know that women brought us into this world but be honest if that was the case then all women would be doing exactly what their mothers wanted them to be growing up just saying all women can relate to mom guilt,1
it was super difficult to mashup this whole fight parts searching for all the parts in the anime it was difficult but enjoyed it hope you guys would enjoy too part part part part dont forget my backup channel enjoy,2
more than a thousand chapters and for me it is still the most dramatic luffy fight in no other have i felt that it has had to be pushed to the limit as in this one,2
so glad usopp returned for this part of the arc tho we never got an explanation to where sogeking went,2
definitely one of luffys toughest opponents ever seeing that luccis fighting skills were superior than his pretimeskip,2
when i first watched this i was so hyped up i was cheering for luffy to win i felt nervous and also i felt like i was there in a way,2
the ussop moment before the finisher really made this the best main villian finisher in the series so much better than the laido finisher,2
thank you so much for letting us relive this epicness,2
god i love the feeling i get from this anime once it has my attention i live for these moments shg l,2
still the best fight of the series to date and that pop of the gatling is still the most satisfying sound in the show,2
still one of my top fights of one piece,2

this one also looks promising because the directors are same and hrithik looks fine as always also excited because the bgm is done by sam cs who is an underrated music director who composed music for the original vikram vedha will need to check the songs done by vishalshekhar who are also good music directors excited for the trailer,2
the tamil one sethupathi gave a more calmer yet menacing version of vedha whereas hrithik here seems to be out and out brutal really eager to see how good he has been throughout the entire movie,2
ive watched original vikram vedha tamil and honestly i just loved vijay setupathi as vedha and his mannerisms but i would love to see hrithik as vedha,2
gave me goosebump at the last hearing the original bgm,2
this got me so hyped especially hrithik being the highlight for me also the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well achara saying that it wasnt convincing actually makes me believe that shes just still adjusting to seeing hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to and the background setting of imambara from lucknow though,2
the movie is based on one of the panchatantra stories of vikramraja vikramadityavedhaghost theme is where the raja is haunted by the ghost and it tells raja one story and asks questions at the end of each story and based on the answer the ghost will take action panchatantra stories are the childhood stories about morals and the directors have made a nice depiction in the movie,1
despite being a remake everyone is excited and going to support this film because of its outstanding starcast their performances is going to be fire especially of hrithik he never disappoints always tries to bring something different to the audience,2
tamil is a tremendous success may they get that success or more in hindi too looking at the casting there is hope and so are the directors the end bgm is,2
a lot of people are missing the reason why hrithik went in different direction to vedhas character than sethupathis calm composed vikram vedha is based on old indian folk talemythology of vikrambetaalbaital from baitalpachisi betaal is described as a creaturemonster who questions king vikramadityas strong sense of justice betaal is little bit crazy and inhuman addressing acharas concern and thats the vibe im getting from hrithiks vedhas unlike sethupathi they are going more traditional route and hrithik didnt copy amitabhs character from agneepath either honestly i like the approach original creators and hrithik took for this one,1
while everyone is appreciating greek godlets take a moment to appreciate saif as well this man is definition of diverse roles from playing funny goofy college guys to playing intense roles like sartaj udaybhan in tanhaji and vikram he proved that atleast one major khan in industry works in realistic cinema as well he also have maintained his physique and look at such age definitely deserves appreciation,2
sorry about the bland background everyone we will back to our original space for episode hope you guys liked our reactions,2
you can tell its their first romance drama,1
lmao i don t think y all are understanding junho s character minwoo is his roommate that is all he s keeping whale talk with youngwoo to only lunchtime because he wants to get to know her therefore they talk about other things than whales anytime else and his reaction to her in the wedding dress was his awakening to liking her lol he s not confused,1
it s ok don t worry about the background im glad my favourite youtubers are doing their reaction,2
the brides father in this is in a ton of dramas hes really good at playing harsh grandfather or ceo types usually if hes in a drama i watch it,2
junho and minwoo are roommates thats why you saw him in the mirror when junho was brushing his teeth and at the end her father kept repeating the fact that she got him sushi to point out how ironic it was that his daughter went to a highend restaurant but got him sushi which is the japanese version of gimpap which is literally what he sells and what he made her for breakfast its ironic cuz if it were anybody else who went to an expensive restaurant they would have brought back something that he usually wouldnt eat not sushi and in the car the lawyer lady told him to stop talking to young woo about whales entirely which is not what he did he didnt listen to her cuz he doesnt find it annoying the reason he set up a specific time is so she wouldnt call him while hes in the bathroom or if hes busy also you could see he was disappointed when she said she has nothing else to say to him and thats because he wants her to be curious about him but she isnt so he already likes her,1
im gonna become your patreon just because this show and those hats i love you guys,2
by the way if this hasn t commented yet all the cases in the episode happened in real life or real cases the was a lawyer who wrote essay about his cases they bought the copyright from him and hire him as their consultant as a lawyer to have the perfective of an attorney this episode focus about being independent from your parent especially going into marriage remember at the beginning young woo s father wish that someday her daughter will get married because it all father s dream to walk their daughter into the aisle and at the end of the episode yw said that if she will get married someday she will not throw the bouquet instead hand it to him so that he can get married since he never have a change to have one and just take care of her which is just the sweetest thought a daughter saying to a single parent so that he will not be lonely then our bride finally have the guts to be free from her father s grasped because he is controlling her so much that she doesn t have the say if she is arranged to be married lastly junho and min woo are friends and flatmates they are not gays anyway you will find out in the coming episodes,1
her dad was being sarcastic in the most compassionate way when she brought him seaweed sushi from the expensive restaurant like she had the option to bring him literally anything else from a place thats k per meal and she brings something similar to what he spends all day making its like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients but from woo young woos perspective gimbapseaweed sushi is her favorite thing so it was a gift of love for her dad,2
they fell in love with the lawyer with the wedding dress and that smile,2
this movie was tricky with the amount of swearing in it youtube kept restricting it as and blocked in some countriesterritories so i had to mute all the f words so that everyone can have access to the video,0
its so cute that dasha was so happy when she was able to pronounce thriller,2
as insane as walter is he was correct about the kidnappers being amateurs and the toe belonging to someone else,0
the coen brothers are two of the greatest american directors i iike all of their films but as others have suggested fargo and raising arizona are essential films to see,2
the fact that walter practically causes half the film s problems yet it turns out in the end not to mention for all for the wrong reasons he was right about everything,0
this film becomes much more enjoyable as you watch it several times,2
for how overthetop walter is he is a lovable character,2
having enjoyed two of the coen brothers movies you should probably watch a few more i think fargo is probably the one i would recommend most raising arizona o brother where art thou and true grit would probably also be on the short list for followup movies,2
julianne moore is an excellent actress here playing an artist who wants to be a single mother,2
this movies actually a play on the s film noir style of filmmaking movies like the maltese falcon the big sleep or later on stuff like chinatown about a jaded detective starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when youve got it all figured out a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light so basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the detective was an aging hippy with no sense of selfmotivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it at the time it came out people compared it to their previous film fargo which while it had distinctly minnesotan humor it was still a serious truecrime story in the end but comparison the big lebowski is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story thats about nothing and people didnt like it it became whats known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance,1
true story and sad about val kilmer having throat cancer and pretty much unable to act again and tom cruise fought to have val kilmer to be in the film writing in his condition and his appearance in the film was absolutely beautiful,2
a sequel that deserves and gets a wonderful reaction from mish ellie the final half hour of this is a real emotional wringer no matter what but it s especially intense and all the more adrenalinfilled if like mish ellie you ve seen the first film already,2
in the final scene it really is tom cruise flying the plane and it really is his plane he also owns and pilots a jet,1
michelle its a privilege to fly with maverick ellie tell that to his dad legit spat tea choked at that one re mavs f being unable to fly again after his demo pulling gs damages the structure of aircraft too many gs will break the airframe immediately but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage microscopic cracks that build up over time invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks sometimes during normal nonextreme flying to combat this all aircraft have a rated glife that is the maximum cumulative number of gs they can pull in their lives before theyre retired as a precautionary measure mavs extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his f immediately but they may have used up so much of its glife that its effectively scrap anyway,0
its really cool to compare the leap in cinematography when it comes to filming the action with the fighters in the s it was amazing but now it looks pretty calm and the shots in this movie taken from inside and outside the planes are amazing,2
the numbers on the screen that were climbing was gforce g stands for gravity gs is x gravity gs is x gravity etc he pulled over gs which means at that one particular moment he weighed x his body weight the same goes for the aircraft what he was saying to maverick was that he put so much stress on the aircraft that it bent the frame itself making it unairworthy since you would have to replace everything anyway,1
ive been waiting for this one since you did the first im so conflicted i spent most of my life using top gun as an example that not all great movies need a sequel then the bastards made one and then they added insult to injury by making it so fucking good lol,0
its the best action movie seen all year and its understandable why tom cruise went out of his way to get this movie seen in theaters that feeling of watching a movie and feeling all the adrenaline was almost gone good reaction girls,2
ellie loves goose a lot few times goose was shown through flashbacks or mentioned she was emotional,2
one of the best movies ive ever seen honestly i wasnt even a big fan of the first top gun so i had no expectations with this one but it blew me away,2
y all know that jr and kane clip made my day,2
kane had some of the best returns in his career the pops that he got were ridiculously unreal they shouldve given kane more world championships than they did,2
the way bischoff sold and got hit with edgrs spear honestly looks like he died especially when it looked like he hit his head on the bottom turnbuckle,0
kinda sad that cenas return at mitb wasnt on here but it was still a great video none the less,2
jr going wild when cena returned in the royal rumble made the moment even more epic and iconic,2
john cena returning at mitb should ve been on this list michael cole lost his voice lol,1
when sasha banks returned michael cole its bosss timmmmeee,1
my would have been cena returning at mitb last year hearing cole sound like joey styles when cena came out was hilarious,2
sting returning at wm and rock returning at on raw was litrerly the loudest pop and commentators were absolutely going wild,2
we all know john cena s return from this year should ve been on there,1
matt smith portrayal of daemon targaryen was nothing short of perfection he plays the character the way i imagined he would be in a live action format cant wait for yah to see more of him also ladies this show is about the dance of dragons so yah wont be seeing the mad king in this show,2
matt smith is another example of dont judge a casting until you see them in the role because i was like bruh they got dr who to play one of the most badass characters in the history of westeros then i saw this episode and was highly impressed,2
i liked that they showed daemon crying at the funeral they took great effort to show how antagonistic he is but then showed us he clearly loves his family,2
as a fan of grrm and reading all materials associated with this story i must agree with george dameon targaryen is my favorite characters within these histories definitely top two i ride with dameon lololol get ready for a ride,2
they were not at dragonstone for the great council at the beginning they were at harrenhal otto hightower is playing the game if lady alicent gains the kings favor house hightower moves up from being a noble house to a royal one they would gain more power and influence,1
to answer you ladies my sister was a military nurse and in her studies the first cesarean goes way back to switzerland in the s and believed to be the way julius cesar was born hence the name then the first one came to the us in the s but they were brutal and often resulted in death for both mother and child and a last ditch effort until jesse bennett dedicated himself to perfect it and his students made the practice normal all over the world and by csections were normal and a way of life,1
ned stark would have never ever sent one of his daughters to do foolishness like that and it makes me miss him yet again,0
ladies daemon targaryen is george martins favorite character in all books hes written this show will be fun with him being the instigator,2
your guys reaction is everything this is gonna be a fun series to follow ur reactions on i can t wait y all had me rolling so much shock and awe this show had me hooke within minutes so nice to be back,2
dreams are extremely important to targaryens the reason they were able to escape the doom of valyria is because a targaryen girl dreamed of the doom and was able to warn her family,2
they never disappoint proud of them all blackpink is really the revulotion they are purr but blinks please keep attention for spotify please stream and listen there too,2
my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,0
speaking about backrooms you definitely should check out the complex found footage free game on steam its heavily inspired by kane pixels version and nails the vibe,2
i have a theory for that green cracking in the walls if you look closely at the entrance she came from it widens so i think that the backrooms was making a new nest for the entity but since the rooms entrance got so wide the entity was given a chance to capture her also you hear its roar before it cuts editjust figured out that human blood causes the bacteria on bodies to grow so the green lighting is definitely something else,1
kane has proven without a doubt that he truly has serious talent when it comes to storytelling and world building i can t wait to see what he has in store for us later down the line glad to see you re still keeping up with the series ryan,2
lucky that steel energy card wasnt very old some collectors would be having a mental breakdown if it was also love to see u got pokemon cards too and love to see more backrooms content,2
the humor and jokes of ryan is just top tier easily one of the best comedic gaming youtubers,2
theory for the green lightning at the walls in the end the lightning looks very similar to the vines where the entity was nesting so to theorize the backrooms creates nests for those who are about to die as you can hear the entity getting closer and closer as the green lightning generates,1
if im thinking correctly ever since they opened the backrooms random holes have been appearing around the world this kid and the car driver happend to stumble upon them,1
imagine all the friends and family who went missing without a trace ended up in the backrooms,0
i agree with ryan the sound design is on point animations world building too kane pixels is a very talented year old person,2
no sequel to a movie that is over years old should be this damn spectacular i saw this opening night in imax and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life the sound of the jets flying by the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the g forces kick in and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots i legitimately believed during the final dogfight that maverick was going to die so few movies today make me believe that on top of all that the story is so freaking amazing the theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones the story of rooster learning to not just forgive maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and don t think just fly and of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when maverick visits iceman even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance thank you tom cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie in theaters,2
tom cruise is truly the embodiment of megastardom one of the best films in decades,2
i love how hangman could ve been a typical cliche bad guy and he absolutely isn t he s cocky and arrogant in top gun because that s what top gun brings out of young pilots their competitive nature once he s on the aircraft carrier he is all business encouraging and ready to help i love that,2
sad that val kilmer iceman has been dealing with throat cancer these last few years you saw him in willow but its beautiful how they wrote his illness into the story and gave his character weight and honor he also played batman once,2
spiderman no way home and top gun maverick both brought back the moviegoing experience in huge droves as both films became one of the first films to gross over billion worldwide at the box office since the pandemic began also tom cruise and paramount made the right decision delaying this for two years because its a film thats made for the big screen and everyone knows that,2
mags if you remember from the beginning of the first film penny benjamin was mentioned briefly as one of the reasons why maverick got disciplined several times,1
val kilmer lost his voice for real due to throat cancer but they used an ai computer program to digitally recreate his voice it was nice to see them bring him onboard for this movie heartwarming and one of the most amazing moments in the film all because tom wanted him to be a part of this movie so much i got to meet val kilmer at a convention a few years ago after he beat cancer but lost his voice he was one the bravest and kindest guys ever,2
i used to own a betamax similar to vhs tape of top gun many years ago and me and my kids aged and would watch it almost daily now theyre grown up and have their own family and yet we got to watch maverick together at home here in the philippines it was an absolutely amazing sequel and yes we all felt the stress and emotions just as you did magy your reactions were so on point and wonderful to watch thank you,2
im with you magy i loved this movie and felt it was actually better than the first,2
fun fact the reason why the f fighter that maverick mentions when hes briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the gps jamming in actuality behind the scenes the f didnt have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the f s they needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the f couldnt accommodate that,0

was the asoiaf dream prophecy a bit much or just right we liked it but we have questions and well be discussing it on our livestream this thursday head to and join the bar regular tier to get early and uncut access to our hotd bar commentary and livestream coverage,2
this show being back in the bar makes me so nostalgic nostalgic we all felt when got was the most hyped show after one episode i am optimistic about house of the dragon and it will be a pleasure to watch these reactions again cheers,2
the genuine disgust everyone had at otto telling alicent to go to the king and give him comfort while wearing one of her mothers dresses is everything i think daemon is going to be a standout character thanks to matt smiths nuance portrayal of him i loved smiths delivery and daemons blunt acknowledgement of the truths viserys cant bear to face as ever thank you so much for sharing your reactions looking forward to the season to come,2
poor viserys hes a good dude but he suffers the human flaw that almost everyone suffers hes adverse to hearing harsh truths about himself even from his own brother,0
when viserys was talking about the winter coming danys theme was also playing it was so sad,0
que nost lgico ver sus reacciones me acuerdo que esperaba despu s de cada episodio la reacci n del bar falt gente pero sigue siendo el mismo placer saludo desde argentina de un fan de got que los conoci gracias a la serie,2
i love how we never heard daemon say the heir for a day,2
green haired girl is back and giggly as ever lol she s dope though my guy shaggy is by her side of course al roker jr is trying to be a scene stealer he s bringing all the sass john cena to his left is completely unbothered david spade is behind them for support hagrid and chris evans have new seats this is great sean,2
promise me rhaenyra promise me echoes lyannas promise me ned promise me,1
such a good feeling seeing you guys back at the bar watching game of thrones this just feels right,2
targaryans have prophetic dreams called dragon dreams however as maester aemon said i see them in my dreams sam i see a red star bleeding in the sky i still remember red i see their shadows on the snow hear the crack of leathern wings feel their hot breath my brothers dreamed of dragons too and their dreams killed them every one the grief and glory of house targaryen,0
daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in fire and blood the heir for a day brothel scene really makes me question him we saw that he s not enjoying himself at all despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the gold cloaks accomplishments with the boys mysaria seems to be an enabling force goading him into his darker tendencies when he says we must all grieve in our own ways i think he actually was somewhat saddened by baelon s and aemma s death daemon does want power but he does love his brother over the centuries house targaryen has produced both great men and monsters prince daemon was both in his day there was not a man so admired so beloved and so reviled in all westeros he was made of light and darkness in equal parts to some he was a hero to others the blackest of villains archmaester gyldayn,0
absolutely in love with this new show already loved all the actors and rhaenyras dracarys was absolutely amazing,2
important to note there s adult dragons under targ control but there s also unhatched and juvenile dragons and also some wild dragons just chilling on dragon stone so in total there should be around alive in this period,1
that childbirth scene was gruesome the screams affected me just as much as shireen s burning at the stake,0
house of the dragon is inspired by georges book called fire and blood which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the game of thrones universe the tragic fight was called the dance of dragons and this event takes place years before daenerys the funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself thats because the dance of dragons was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen and yes it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished so for the series we can expect less seasons than got and a more complete story different from the ending of got that was not written by george since the books still are not finished but all the characters of house of the dragon were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes hope i helpedxx,1
targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams the only reasons the house survived the doom of valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to dragonstone even in game of thrones dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs thats why she did it this is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all,0
why is it always in breech breech is and rises sharply with multiple births like the queen has its not common but it rises to between in to in,1
my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s or s of game of thrones,0
the way you both missed the babys death is hilarious,1

existem cantores bons timos excelentes e existe dimash simplesmente incr vel um grande abra o do brasil,2
this avemaria composed by igor krutoy sang by dimash as you see this song is amazing,2
the composer of this is the piano player igor krutoy he came out of semiretirement to work with dimash he has composed for people like lara fabian and andrea bocelli igor wrote a post about this song on his ig one evening about three months before the new wave dimash called me and asked if i could write ave maria for him explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style coincidentally i had a free evening and i gladly sat down at the piano and remembering the italian formula of responsibility worked with inspiration until i achieved the desired result after taking a few days for the composition to rest in my ears soul and heart i sent it to dimash who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear and of course the reception and applause given to dimash by the audience at the new wave show what a happiness it is to do what i love to write for such a genius singer to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand just a short essay on what is happiness,2
me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y ri ndose antes de que dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido se quedaron mudos esta es la capacidad que tiene dimash de cautivar al p blico sin decir una sola palabra es maravilloso esta es una composici n de igor krutoy especialmente para dimash no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla y vaya que lo logra gracias por su sincera admiraci n al magnifico dimash,2
this vocalise of ave maria was composed by igor krutoy especially for dimash it goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional songs is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as dimash the greatest vocalist i have ever heard in my years on this planet and ive heard some really great singers along the way and in every genre ever conceived what a blessing to experience this voice this incomparable talent btw very nice reaction,2
everyone expects the schubert version but then dimash and igor blow their minds with one vowel,1
soy de costa rica pura vida amo a dimash el es el mejor del mundo,1
unbelievable recently filmed in germany titled the innovators featuring young adults from around the world who have turned their industries on their heads and impacted them forever opens with dimash qudaibergen at is changing the face of todays music worldwide widely considered a music and business genius sole head and decision maker of his production company its state of the art on a campus of studios stage warehouses conference and creative centers and administration buildings and produces every aspect of his career in house from films videos albums to concerts tickets sales and distribution of merchandise pr marketing administration legal and more surrounds himself with world class talent in every field hands on and laser focused the only operation of its kind globally no air date yet,2
hes not younger this was hes was at the time same as stranger and fly away this is an original composed version of ave maria by igor krutoy per dimashs request it does share some similarities with the caccini composition and might have been the inspiration some have posited that because igor is jewish and dimash is muslim they may have opted to forego the lyrics for this reason which would make sense again i dont believe that has been confirmed by either one,1
do you want a sequel leave a like subscribe full length watch alongs more for sexy rejects,1
i dont care what anyone says about it or how its not comic accurate i absolutely adore this movie,2
such a shame we havent got a sequel of this movie keanu its a really good fit for the character,2
also loved the portrayal of lucifer al pacino did his cool version of him around this time too but stormare blew him away,2
i would really like to see a sequel to the movie with keanu reeves coming back as the titular character and guillermo del toro directing this was back in but with their busy schedules looks like we might have to wait a little while longer,2
yay this movie is underrated imo so glad you re seeing it i m sad keanu couldn t get it rolling as a franchise,2
cool little detail you might have missed is that at the beginning when that guy finds the spear of destiny and then turns and looks over his shoulder at seemingly nothing it was because he sensed constatine was behind him later on in the movie when constatine uses that electric chair to track down where the spear is it shows him standing behind the guy when he finds the spear so its like a little time travel thing,1
this was a great movie on its own and wouldve been great as a standalone series shame it didnt get a sequel but i like it as it is as well i know some people dont like it because of it not reflecting the comics character as much but i say it was a very good version of it,2
i really like tilda swinton in this movie and even though a lot of people didn t like it when it came out i did i m glad you re watching it now greg good stuff,2
i still think this movie is visually stunning for the time that it was made every shot and all the cgi and practical effects look so amazing in this movie,2
you need to watch his first guy to play tag and the first guy to play duck duck goose one his funniest ones,2
love kristen s laugh,2
the faces kristen was making before starting the video had me laughing pretty hard,2
i still love how there s a point where he clearly defogged the goggles,2
amazing laugh xd this one made me crack up too xd,2
the moment jaby said that ostrich ran into a wallit straight up reminded of that kevin hard ostrich video,1
love when jaby cracks up,2
the best laughter duo,2
kristens such a vibe tbh,2
hrithik once said giving d audience same thing what they ve seen is redundant give them something more a little more n he gave us a lottt more we fans r loving him he s d most versatile n all rounder actor in bollywood perfect blend of everything,2
ive just recently watched the original but ive to say that this teaser actually looks really good im not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but ive high hopes from this film because its the same duo who directed the original one personally i dont have any problems from a remake and i dont think remaking something is a crime the remake however has to be good if it doesnt justify the acting of the original actors then its a crime otherwise if its a remake like kabir singh which is a really good remake then i dont have any problems and i feel this remake will be genuinely good,2
vijay sir has his own charm and hr has his own please dont compare both are legends,2
the intro was so good this time you guys somehow always manage to outdo yourself each time loving how you hype hrithik always worth watching your admiration for the right things in bollywood in your reactions,2
agneepath is the movie you need to watch also langda tyagi character in omkara actually changed saifs persona as an actor,2
last film you saw of hrithik in theater was war not super,1
brilliant teaser perfect remake movie may go beyond it since same directors would have streamlined script filling the donts moving to the fact of you guys so you havent watched vikram vedha original and going to love this movie upto your choice yet thats hypocrisy,2
i am glad hrithik seems to take a different approach sethupatis vedha seemed a bit cold calculative but hrithik seems to be psychotic at times he seems like a sadistic beast waiting to be unleashed,1
i am tamil i love the rmadhavanvjs movie by watching this we might get more footages and backstory that we missed in the tamil version and wow hrithiks craziness is awesome,2
hrithik is a terrific actor u cant deny,2

so enjoyable and so funny video,2
watching doflamingo s speech after reverie is even crazier,0
this was extremely enjoyable notice how we didnt have rob talking shit about zoro i hope reactions can be like this from now on,2
its worth noting that laws plan was to destroy the smile factory to get kaido mad at doflamingo so doflamingo and kaido would end up fighting each other taking down doflamingo themselves wasnt part of the plan,0
remember at the beginning when it was luffy a lone pirate with his small boat and a green hair bounty hunter who uses three swords that was tied to a pole ohh how one piece has come a long way,2
that doffy spitch man doffy is such a w character got chills even if its the fifth time im seeing it,2
its so crazy that this week they reacted to the post dressrossa bounties and were getting post wano bounties in this weeks manga chapter,2
shame doffy chose to be a pirate and warlord he could have had an excellent future as a public speaker,1
luffy doesnt just have people under him he also has supporters from all the places he been from alabasta skypiea fishman island and etc he has allies everywhere our boys making it to the big leagues,2
in doflamingo speech the treasure he was talking about he knows something that the they re keeping it a secret who knows how long will they keep it in the shadow,1
while jerry can be annoying sometimes i appreciate that he still gives credit where credit is due as opposed to rob who will go out of his way to not pay respect when it s been earned rightfully,1
i have watched vikram vedha on youtube in hindi last year i dont think saif can beat r madhwan in acting r madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie but saif doesnt look innocent at all throughout the trailer r madhwans smile was enough to make vikram vedha a thriller movie,2
vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor i have seen in south industry n r madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece,2
krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for hours it will become blockbuster,2
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging to lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,0
i always wonder why his videos are never in trending they are so hilarious yet to the point,2
everyone is busy praising this moviebut i prefer the original anytimeno comparison therebut your reviews are as usual hilarious,2
not willing to watch others review always waiting for legend mr krk,1
hey krk you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest everyone can agree that the recent vikram vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art yeah its a remake but why it has made because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time hrithik roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work so guys dont take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like krk,1
hilarious review i am pakistani and i always wait for krk videos by god big fan krk bro i watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review also id say krks viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news so he deserves for views like and followers love from lahore pakistan,2
vijay sir is gem and true legend bollywood cant match it even hritik cant,2
we have a slightly new setup now so the lighting and audio might go through a few changes over the next week or so while we tinker to see what lookssounds the best the audio seems to be a bit jarring at times hopefully we can get that fixed we hope you enjoy the video for our full length reaction you can visit our patreon,2
so happy y all are reacting to hotd i found you two through the arcane reactions and i m so excited to watch you watch yet another hopefully amazing series,2
it is true that we didnt hear daemon said the heir for a day and his account might be true after all when he said we each mourn our own ways we are only told via ottos report and we know they despised each other the labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way just like the title the queen who never was could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen maybe daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew one thing is for sure though i think his love for his brother is genuine however rogue his ways are he knows his brother is weak and he sees otto hightower for what he is he really wanted to protect his brother from crows thats waiting for a feast hes definitely going to be a grey character and they tend to be the most interesting,1
thats what you got from daemons smile how are everyone giving daemon villain tag so quickly it feels like i saw some other episode and many other people saw another it felt more like my brother knows me hes right these other idiots know nothing smile daemon is vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra at the funeral,0
i actually loved daemon he seems to actually love his family as soon as the king said why would i do that about not making him his handdaemons immediate answer was cause i m your brotherit didn t sound like it was a birth right thing but that he was actually hurt his brother didn t choose him and he s for sure not wrong the console is playing him they see his weakness and you can afford to show weakness as a leader it s a fact,2
so excited you guys are reacting to this can t wait to start this journey with you both,2
i think everyone just antogonising daemon but personally i dont think hes bad guy hes just an extreme person and soon enough they will notice how necessary he was nblike this comment if you think so too cause i have a gut feeling by the end of this season or maybe next people will understand him eren yager effect,1
after the foul taste the original got left in my mouth i didnt have very high hopes for this yet i watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons maybe not quite there yet but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it i find it hard to pinpoint daemon on the one hand he wants to show strength the city watch part but then hes also arrogant the tournament claiming victory while the fight wasnt over and straight up horrible heir for a day but on the other hand he really cares for rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her her father would need him more now than ever before which shows he also cares for viserys i think him calling viserys weak was his blunt way of telling viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king which is in line with what he did with the city watch he feels like the king should show his strength viserys seems like hes held things together for those years but this clearly is coming to an end i feel like hes made a huge mistake by alienating daemon this wont make things easy for rhaenyra who already has to fight the fact that some people dont want a woman on the throne in the end i think it will be between those two and viserys will be long gone from the picture,0
they referenced the white walker prophecy at the end when the king was talking to his daughter seems it s a warning passed from king to king little did they know it took years to come to pass and the king even says a targaryen has to be on the throne to win that cold war yes it s rumored the throne rejects those who aren t worthy by cutting them this whole series will show us how such a powerful family like the targaryen s become the died off long lost house we see in season of got when daenerys was with her brother cast out and ridiculed so we re gonna see what they did to themselves to become that so low and from dragons on total around in this series to dragons no longer even exist in got and are old rumors each targaryen pairs with a dragon either a new one or one passes down from a deceased relative there are young and old dragons dragon eggs trainers and keepers so cool,1
pretty sure that daemon didnt actually say the heir for a day even in the books its implied that otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers and daemon just didnt want to say anything at that moment he is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure,0

imagination badal pinned my comment badalispiro,1
the original movie was op and the teaser of this movie looks promising hopefully it would not disappoints us,2
casting is looking perfect but it would be more enjoyable if we didnt know the story bcoz the original vedha was unpredictable and this time we know each and every move of him,2
i think that this vedha by hrithik is much more brutal and crazy as setupathis vedha seemed to be more calmalso hrithik roshan has always surprised usbe it super guzaarish agneepath,1
i think we should give this movie a chance because hritik has never disappointed us in acting from blind to teacher from theive to secret agent his acting was always on point,2
don t care if it is a remake or not if hrithik roshan is in it,2
when hrithik says iss baar sirf majah hi nahi tajub bhi hoga at the starting of the teaser makes me feel that there some surprise for the audience or change in the story im too excited for it,2
i dont care even if its a remake because i havent seen the original one and it seems like it would be a good upgraded remake so looking forward,2
i have high expectations in this film the trailer is soo much exciting,2
from bollywood these two actors can do these role,2

one of the thing about this dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he always respects us the audience and his team and he is polite in all his videos we congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come we are always with you,2
lets all appreciate the content his man and his crew makes its just a masterpiece imagin whats hes gonna doing in the future,2
i respect to everyone who involved in this seriously the best piece that ive ever seen on youtube hats off to well all love your video,2
he can roast anybody without making them feel bad,0
this guy genuinely knows how to roast and still stay in a limit and respect that person,2
lets all appreciate the content this man and his crew makes its just a masterpiece imagine whats hes gonna doing in the future,2
one best thing about dude is that whenever he achieves something he never gives the credit to himself he always respect us the audience the most and his team too he is always polite in every of video we congratulate ourselves for this achievement more to come and everything comes we always with you rtzg,2
lets all appreciate the content of this man and his crew makes its just a masterpiece imagine whats hes gonna doing in the future,2
he sticks to a formula but the tunes dont get repetitive you gotta be a certain level of cold for that to work,1
all credit where it s due walkz the only reactor i ve seen who truly understands how goated trappo is,1
we have to start having a conversation for trapo in the top of drilltrap all time the run he s been on in the last year is an all timer bmt,1
yh top drill songs at least of the year imo his thought process to bar is different to everyone else,2
watching your stream got me to like this tune big facts the energy was mad,2
k trap has been on a run for like months since he went independent top in the whole uk hands down any genre my nigga don t miss big up my guy walkz we appreciate the content always,2
i dunno if i m just deeping it too much but there s so much subtle things in the video like when he says he caught amnesia didn t finish the bar and he just let the beat play with the ad lib i ain t saying a thing it was so simple but effective idk am i overthinking it,1
shells in my palm like peanuts,1
k trap knows how to go off on a track beat selection is brazy,1
not everyone makes walkz like this mancold still,1
this guy can literally play any instruments he was awarded for being the youngest tabla player and tht was when he was or something year old,2
the first one is an ar rahman composition again sung by mohit chauhan this is from the movie rockstar mindblowing album,2
he is not only a fabulous singerbut also a great composer lyricistgreat human beinghe knows to play every instrumentsand he is brand ambassador of uttarakhand culture,2
this guy is literally the greatest talent ever come to any reality show yet his humility is still intact and makes his so lovable,2
he can play guitar keyboard tabla piano and many more he can sing play instruments can compose also,1
he is amazing do check out his teri mitti vande mataram full performance he killed itttt,2
pawandeep played all instruments with soulful singing at same time,2
also react to his teri mitti me mil jawan or tere bin nai jeena both are his best performance in the season,2
checkout his other performancesthis guy have a bundle of talentshe sing so amazing and also he can play almost every instruments,2
please we want more of his performances,2
maturity is when you realise lakshay is increasing his quality content day by day,2
even this min video is more meaningful than their whole lifetime videos on health and hygine in their channel,2
more power to you honestly seen your content ideas grow since last few yearsjust know you are improving and doing your best to entertain us,2
huge respect for uhow gracefully you explained your point feels greats to see you evolving into a better and mature content creator,2
respect for you this is just facts and defending yourself in the most respectful way ever no cheapsake nonsense and just facts that is all so proud of the absolute maturity you have shown,2
after reaching a certain age her daughter will surely agree the facts told by lakshay just remember it,2
kaafi crisp bro usually just a silent observer to such beef but it was impressive how you still managed to keep a level head through out it,2
content that you and thugesh create are real fun and respectful also without crossing the limits of roasting be consistent always thats your key,2
going through the video after watching the live session that lakshya did before this video made me realise his unshined talent that had yet to come to light in acting the difference is his pitch language body language taking thing like i will file a case for granted really shows his supremacy and how much of an alpha he is it really reminds me of the aparichit the person who was in his youtube video and the person who was in his in his live almost feel like they were two different individuals i dont support anyone of them prince and his wife had milked there child and they not tackled any of the allegation he was just taking out his anger making personal comments but i cant just blind eye on things that lakshya said just because im his subscriber and this had cleared that the past allegation like ganging up bulling were some how true lakshya portraying an image of the person that he is not thinking we should not abuse in youtube because its an public platform and spread hate but can make an abusive live video on insta i guess insta is not a public platform anymore and its strike one thing that lakshay is not abuse because of the problem that he had faced in his past for making that kind of content,1
lets w a moment to to appreciate how much effort he puts into his contact to entertain,2
the best part about the teaser is that both hrithik and saif look drastically different from r madhavan and vijay sethupathi and very honestly hrithiks vedha is looking slightly more menacing than vijays im cautious but highly excited at the same time im quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if im not wrong theyve said it isnt a scene to scene remake hopefully optimistic,2
i m from chennai but i m a big fan of hrithik and don t tell me it s a remake it s a beautiful script which is worth to be filmed again and i m glad hrithik is doing the villain role,2
i respect to everyone who wear involved in seriously the best piece that ve every seen on youtube hats off to well all i love your video,2
hrithik is next level no one can beat him he not copy vijay setupati he played his character in own swag the king of indian cinema hr,2
this is what reaction channels should learn from pj straight to the fkng reaction without talking any trash and it genuinely feels like he is watching it for the first time as always pj nevee dissapoints,1
pj never dissapoints while saying maine original movie nahi dekhi,1
chalo mai bhi likh deta hu pj never disappoints btw sach mein nhi karta ye banda disappoint,1
you should watch the original movie featuring r madhavan and vijay sethupati its a masterpiece,2
first time after a long time after kabir singh this look promising i watched original i dont want to know about story line i just want to see the maniac and dense acting of these two,2
its directed by original director so hell yeah im gonna watch it,2
i love the original tamil movie the tamil version solidified vijay sethupathy as my favorite actor the whole concept of setting up the story in the vikram vetal backdrop was so unique the climax fight vedha has a come what may unhinged chaotic attitude and the crazy banter between vikram and vedha during the fight it was absolutely fresh to look at personally i love both saif and hrithik i really dont want to compare vjs and hrithik ill be honest i was skeptical about the remake but the teaser does look promising i love hrithiks attempt at being the unhinged vedha except for the accent as you rightly pointed out the teaser does look promising even though the bgm is very good i was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head i do miss it i really really really hope and pray this movie does well,2
theres this eccentricity in hrithiks eyes that tells me hell do full justice to this role he has his own unique style and wont be just mimicking vijay sethupathy i have faith in this movie because of the makers really looking forward to it people just have to approach it with an open mind rather than being so negative even before the release,2
the only thing thats exciting me in this film is hrithiks portrayal of a gray shaded character hrithik roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform,2
that sam cs bgm towards the end gave me massive goosebumps vishalshekar and sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack,2
the only thing that matters is box office hrithiks agneepath was a box office hit and his vijay is totally different from amitabhs vijay if he can succeed in making a new vijay then i dont know why people are saying cant match vijay sethupati all that matters is box office rest people will always criticize no matter if its actually great,1
initially when i heard that hrithik roshan is playing role of veda i doubted if he could fit into that role which vijay sethu pathi immortalized that characterafter watching the teaser i am surprised and excited to see veda in this remake version congratulations to both heroes hrithik roshan and ofcourse vikram role is tailor made for saif ali khan,2
fully agree with you regarding that scene where vedha hrithik is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets people have the habit of complaining and most of the people who are complaining they have not even watched the original vv and yes hrithik did not copy amitabh and similarly here he did not copy the great vs,0
in orginal movie and trailer specifically both vikram and vedha were projected to be equals given equal screen time dialogues and actions but here i believe hrithik is being pushed more than saif and thats what bugs me,0
i like how they made hrithik a bit devilish instead of vedha being the calm guy like in the original i feel like vjss vedha is how mohanlal wouldve played vedha and hrithiks version is how mammootty wouldve played the role,1
let me clear you that if you are watching this song without watching movie then its not worthy and you will not understand the reason of this songss rajamouliall time hit movies provider,0
allu arjun stylish dancer ntr speed dancer ram charan graceful dancer allu arjun and ram charan are cousin brothers,1
ram charan dances sooo well but jr ntr debuted as protagonist when he was years old but ram charan came later both actors age is similar like rc is and jrntr is both are good friends off the camera as well btw ram charan is son of mega star chiranjeevi who is a very very good dancer as well so obviously his son would dance good as well,2
now please react to nachore nachore song of jr ntr yamadonga movie ss rajamouli direction sensational dance moves by ntr at the age of in i bet you wont regret after watching that song,2
each and every actor in south industry can dance so well,2
to know ramcharans talent you should watch bangaru kodi petta song from magadeera movie then you will realise how he is capable of,2
i think sufiyan is slowly becoming fan of ntr react to more of ntr my suggestion is nachore nachore song from yamadonga movie you guys will definitely love him more,2
for ur information this is an fact that jrntr is also known as epitome of actingjrntr respectively known for his acting and dance,1
its naatu naatu in original language and jrntr alluarjun ramcharan ram pothineni are the top dancers in telugu film industry,2
im from india love ur vids but i really miss anum in this video,2
rathsasan is not film its soul of indian cinema every to minutes audience is surprise every scenefighting emotion suspense thriller search and horror,1
nobody can beat original one ratsasan what a masterpiece,2
ratsasan is ratsasani mean original is original no one can defeat originial,2
this the master piece our indian movie original is always best,2
ratsasan trailer gives more information of movie scenes except the villain scene and face thats why you were able to guess about disorder and gifts things but cuttputlli trailer just gives few glimpses of ratsasan movie and focused more on akshays dialogue without revealing anything thats the plus point obviously original remains classic but lets see remake works or not,2
its more complex and confusing than you think its good its made in hindi also great movie wish the remake also live up to that react to deva deva song from brahm stra,2
rathsasan goosebumps this movie need appreciation,2
thanos i am the best villain christopherhold my gift ratrassan viewer can relate,1
you should watch rathsasan movieits indias best thriller movieits also available on youtube in hindi dubbed with the name fo main hu dandadhikariplease watch original one and after watch remake,2

drake stand for do right and kill everything drake on forever do right and kill everything drake mode young ma unaccomadating its an acronym and young ma flipped it to work for herself yall be killing it and r mad funny keep paus ng and breaking that ish down good breakdowns should take a good amount of time,1
ive got a feeling theres going to be laps done with this track the bars are,2
eminem studied the rappers that came before him and surpassed them a long time ago that shows a genuine love for the art you should react to brainless and bad guy from eminem both are fantastic songs,2
im a clown like john wayne gacy is one of my favorite things hes ever said,2
his wordplay metaphors punches and diverse flows are just syncopated genius with any beat em the goat of hip hop forever,2
please go for tone deaf the bars are hades itself em rhymes orange with banana there its one of my favourites from the album,2
the real amazing thing about ems first few lines is that he was finishing young ma s rhyme scheme that she started way back in her verse she rhymes quavo facial lay lo wayne mode drake mode rake mode paid so gang mode pain go flame go etc it s out of order i know and then em comes in game oever thanos and finished it the man is a monster but that was nothing but respect to young ma for holding the rhyme scheme out that long which i think was something she did to pay homage to em cause that s his style fire song,2
next one should be not alike by eminem,1
no one even comes close to em flow cadence story telling accents technicality and beats all fit for what he does he is the greatest rapper by a mile and it aint even close,2
what other movie scenes shall we react to see if you can find scenes from your favourite movies hopefully less then mins long just send us the names or links below,2

lovingg all your reactions please react to allu arjuns new song memu aagamu from coke studio india,2
this is one of their best choreographies its so awesome the energy the switch and the formation of the choreo and everything is on point and very detailed it also showcases how smooth of a dancer each member is and how they can match the fierce of the song to the swag good job tbh,2
the hand thing that lisa jennie and jisoo did at ros s part was sooooo satisfying,2
some haters may say ah the movements are easy peasy it seems they forgot that not everyone can pull out some easy movement into extravagant dance stage presence of yg artists never disappoint me blackpink killed and nailed it like always,2
their charisma is on another level you can really see how much they grow confident since the last time they preform,2
in this dance practice lisa movement really sharp crazy shes the main dancer and yes i love all members too blackpink is the revolution,2
i cant wait for them to perform it on vmas im actually kinda expecting this dance practice video because literally earlier this day i checked their last comeback on how many days til they release their dance practice and its only days so i expected it to be released today,2
yg said that title track is going to shake the whole world im so excited for title track,2
its satisfying to watch everytime lisa dance it just her aura really blow up she knows how to control her body her facial expressions the professional dancer behavior,2
i get really mesmerize when lisa is dancing her expression and body control is perfect,2
main dancer lisa coming through way to go bp best choreo,2
what other videos should we react to,1
why am i crying seeing this how much struggle has gone in to gain this independence,0
we have not got freedom for free thousands of known and unknown heroes sacrified their lives to give us freedom my salute to them,2
indian queens are legendary there are several warrior queens throughout the history there were records by marco polo an italian traveler telling stories in italy about the queen of telugu kakathiyas rani rudramadevi original and rightful queen to have the kohinoor aka shiva mani which could be the main reason why the england queen has the diamond in her crown still many queens and kings ruled this great land from all areas it is impossible to know all about them,1
couldnt contain my tears at the jallianwala bagh scene and the pride you feel when subhash chandra bose appears goosebumps and when rani lakshmibai fought so bravely this tribute is just too beautiful,2
the number of times i got goose bumps while watching this video is more than while reading this in books wasnt able to control my tears while watching those sacrifices given by our ancestors heads off to all the people who participated in making our country independent jai hind jai bharat,2
this was amazing we should be proud of our country,2
rani laxmi bai was a queen who faught brits after her husband died watch kanganas movie manikarnika it has the glimpses of rani laxmi bais life,1
how many times did you cry watching this video me yes,1
this is really an amazing animated video that creates goosebumps and fills every indians heart with pride joy and sadness as well the creator mentioned the name assam but i want to add more names of freedom fighters who are from assam and equally contributed foremost name is kanaklata baruah just a years old girl and she took bullet while hoisting indian flag and died on the spot other freedom fighters are gopinath bordoloi jyoti prasad agarwala maniram dewan kushal konwar hem barua tyagbir bhogeswari phukanani other prominent freedom struggle unsung heroes from northeast india are major paona brajabashi bir tikendrajit singh rani gaidinliu years old naga girl haipou jadonang u tirot sing syiemlieh moje riba u kiang nangbah pa togan sangma and the list of names doesnt stop here there are many more,2
lakshya legit killed them with facts love the way hes changing and replying to toxic content creators with such maturity shame on unnatural,0
basically it was an mistake i was trying to give copyright claim to those who use my content but unintentionally it goes copyright strike to my friend kundan btw i am glad you cover my news,2
he wanted a picture with a tall white guy,1
one of the best thing about today that he never text credit for himself when he achieve something he always respect us the audience and his team and he is always polite in all of his video we congratulation our solve on this achievement more to come and everything to come,2
lakshay killed it this time all he said was fax,2
neon man is consistent but not more than thugesh,1
timestamps mrbeast thugesh lakshay chaudhary aryan fit vlogs fit minds lal singh chaddha monu official crazy kundan achivements one like please,1
as u said dont think mrbeast had to do anything in india he just had a connecting flight to maldives and in order excite or grab attention he might have posted his presence,1
saiman the most underrated you tubr and neon man the most timerated you tuber,0
masterpieces cannot be recreated they cannot be overshadowed the original was a masterpiece story was mesmerizing taken from the inspirational olden story of king vikram vampire vedha in a different style bgm was outstanding in tamil both vijay madhavan were given an excellent par performance,2
cant say anything about this now but original one was a master piece thrill suspence was top notch and acting in that by r madhavan and vijay setupati was at their best,2
i know hrx is good but in the original one vijay setupati n r madhvan performance was insane,2
let s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative,2
hrithik is next level no one can beat him he not copy vijay setupati he played the character in his own swag the king of indian cinema hr,2
this movie also available which is dubbed one but best one is original no one match vijay sethupathi but hritik gaves such a glimpse up,2
i dont support remakes but its ok when same director adapts it scene to scene copy,1
ohh my god what a teaser definitely this film create a new box office records hrithik sir acting was mind blowing,2
nothing can beat original vikram vedha,2
yesterday i watched kartikey full of goosebumps,2
this is lowkey emotional after everything thats happened everyones back in pretty much the same place,2
remember when they announced hotd first thought i ll definitely watch this series with my favorite bar and here we are,2
cheers to house burlington its so great to see everyone back like old times this was a pretty brutal ep rip queen aemma im right there with the guy taking a shot during well actually im right there with the squire losing it in the background of the joust then i take the shot to calm my nerves and stomach cuz yikes,2
i was so excited when you announced that the watchers of the bar were returning for house of the dragon im thrilled that the first reaction episode is already out its been so long since we got to see you guys all together again thank you for bringing this back much love from oregon,2
it brings me tremendous joy to see everyone back and this still a thing to us on youtube this is like a reaction reunion thanks for doing this again sean,2
i basically watched all of got by myself none of my real life friends cared for the show so i turned to youtube reactions and somehow you guys became my got friends people who i could relate too after each episode thank you for getting the gang back together,2
after having a whole pandemic between the ending of got and the beginning of hotd its really wonderful to the see the bar crew having a great time all together in one place,2
que bueno veros de nuevo,2
daemon targaryen aka the rogue prince is the best targaryen in the lore of asoiaf and i cant wait for yah to see more of him an we all should take some time to praise matt smith for his portrayal of the character because its nothing short of perfection the show runners hit it out the park with the casting for all of these characters in this prequel,2
this brings me back glad to be with the bar again for this,2
begin is the song written by rm in jungkooks prespective jungkook shared the feelings he felt with his hyungs and rm made that into a beautiful song lyrics,2
i remember at that time idk if its true but ppl were saying that jk almost fainted in chile because he is human and of course he was exhausted but also because it was so hot and the altitude of chile is pretty high for them compared to korea,1
estuvieron en chile en ese entonces no los conoc a los sigo desde como lamento no haberlo conocido antes,1
finally i already missed you so the next one is as soon as possible jungkook and jimin are the ones who get hurt the most they always give more than they expect and often get hard on themselves and often exhaustion and fainting just for everyone to see the best of them in every performance it hurts armys to see him this way,0
jungkook and jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances they are both the ones i noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering jungkook has gotten injured multiple times hes almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted multiple times or came close to it i of course worry about all the members but i always worry the most for jimin jk because we know how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes,0
guysill ask again but may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed id really like to see you to react to them as they are important parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history shows how their emotions developed and changed over time and give further context to a specific era episode of the rise of bangtan i hope you dont just brush them aside as its really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like not sure why that changed but i hope youll quickly return to them before it gets too far off its a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well because it gives you a mental break and as i said really just gives you more and more context and content as the series goes on theyll be more and more important to the series too whether thats answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldnt be further explored in the episode itself youve already missed so much content at the very least its be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when its importance hasnt diminished but increased every episode,2
becoming army truly is a lifechanging experience and one that anyone who hasnt done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand i would have never thought that at the age of i would become such a huge fan and supporter of the boyband my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point years later almost to the day and i look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves they have zero understanding and they all think im crazy i think all i can think is how sad it is that they wont give them a chance and experience the same thing i have i like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is bts you guys are that kind of reactor and its wonderful to see,2
guys is there a chapter or it ended at jungkook is really hard working and perfectionist he want to go on stage matter what happens to him he is turning very soon he grew up,2
remember all the deleted and bonus episodes a chapter is not actually over until you watch them maybe you didn t know i really like to watch you react to rise of bangtan but it s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don t finish a chapter until moving on your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series it s fair id you don t this is just so weird sorry,0
cant wait for episode the rise of bangtan chapter filter,2

managed to finish essays without any distractions because of this soundtrack thank you,2
imagine this you wake up in a room that youve never seen before the bed youre lying in is very comfortable you sink right into it you dont want to leave but you want to know where you are you sit up and looking around the room you see that it looks like youre in a very cozy but very old room this room has seen many many things it seems theres a mirror to use in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice there is a closet full of clothes however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you if you prefer the feminine choice it is a beautiful seafoam green dress with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees grouped with black mary janes and long white socks the masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas with black dress shoes you put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room you go down the stairs of the house to find two people they look like blonde twins one is a boy the other is a girl they are sipping their tea when one of them notices you oh youre awake the boy cries so they are the girl replies they introduce themselves as aaron and anastasia aaron tells you that since youve been asleep all morning it would be good for you to go outside with them you reluctantly agree but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside you see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves there are mountains in the distance and you can also see a nice pond in the sky you can see the moons and even a planet or two you can even faintly see the stars there are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings the three of you walk up to that tree and you spend the rest of the day playing there the twins took turns pushing you on the swing eventually night came and you went back to the house for dinner anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta youd ever had and aaron did the dishes insisting that you relax as their guest after a little while you retired to your bedroom changed into the clothes given to you and succumbed to a calm dreamers sleep wondering what the next day had in store for you,2

last night i was watching the sun set with my cat out of my attic window and thought wow im basicly in a lofi girl art right now perfect time for a new mix,2
i remember two years ago staying up at in the morning with a cup of anxiety just to listen to the am study session premiere at p using limited data on my half cracked phone wondering where ill be in the future and if things will go well for me after i graduate now here i am once again at in the morning with a cup of coffee fast internet and my own custom pc it took a lot to get here and i still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future but for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years just know that if i could make it than so can you i hope you will get to experience the same bliss i have at the moment as we often forget to enjoy just today when we keep thinking about the tomorrows and thank you chilledcow for being there during the moments edit i just want to say i appreciate everyone for all the encouraging likes and messages i wish nothing but the best for all of you who are pulling through your struggles,0

i feel like the lofi community is one of the best one out there its rarer than rare to find toxicity negativity quarrels and stuff theres just a bunch of people searching for inner peace while going on with life i am extremely fortunate to find this community at an early age or thats what i think so hope this community lives forever,2
this mix is really calming despite all the distractions and stresses from daily life and for just a moment i feel at peace,2
i hope one day we can see the whole lofi girls house for now we have the bedroom kitchen porch balcony and different parts of the living room a minecraft map or a virtual world could be great,2

this is the type of song you d sing as a kid and realise what the lyrics mean when u grow up,1
we dont look for old songs we look for the feelings and memories they carry,1
maroon s music videos always show something beyond expectations this song was like watching a profound thriller the video and the song go so well together its a great song and video,2
como esse clipe n o chegou ainda bilh o de visualiza o que injusti a adoro essa m sica pra mim uma das preferidas minhas o clipe nem se fala top demais,1
minha banda favorita,2

esse clipe uma obra de arte,1
essa m sica marcou minha vida,2
y est canci n nos gusta todav a y nos seguir gustando hasta que estemos en nuestra tumba,2
what is your favorite animal,1
maroon is like gta wasnt made for kids but its everyones childhood,1
i think the fact that a lot of people loved this song before even knowing the lyrics shows how good it is a song that can be enjoyed without having any idea what the lyrics are about is a job done right,2
a lot of people seem to misinterpret the meaning its saying that you cant leave me even if you want to you cant stay away from me dont deny the fact that even if we should stay away from each other you want me you love me its about a toxic relationship that just wont die because of the raging sexual tension and romance they cant escape from,0
eu amo esta m sica,1
i am in love with both the lyrics and vibe melody its a masterpiece and perfect for ppl like meits heaven,2
i dont care about meaning of this song i just enjoy the vibe,2
i am speechless lyric is masterpiece and he sing it sooo beautifully,2
asn p sni ka,1
keep up the good work,2
this is a song that i will listen to over and over again and not get tired of,2
his ability to sing so flawlessly in such a crazy head voice his vocal range is ridiculous that vocal technique along with the lyrics and instrumental makes this song so impressive and iconic,2
yrs old vibing now knowing what it means and questioning humanity,1
just relaxing,2
great song as always,2
your songs are great and unstoppable,2
love this song its very special to me,2
i love this song,2
sitting here listening to this song at again realizing what it actually means,1
loved it as always i think you guys literally no my favorites,2
martin garrix was only when he made this song,2
quality music never gets old,2
this isn t a song it s a memory,1
animals is years old and still gives me goosebumps,2
year old clip and i still feel my childhood coming back to me,2
i wish music like this was still played over the radio and at clubs,1
i was listening to this song when they just dropped it years later and it still gives me the same emotions,2
casi una decada y aun sigue sonando esta rola,1
nunca envelhece bate na mesma vibe como se fosse a primeira vez,2
tiempos que no volveran la electronica en su mejor tiempo que recuerdo escucharlas en,2
that was the most fascinating piece of work i have ever seen those wildlife photographers are amazing how they can get so close stunning,2
i love how two male lions express their love and frienship to each other,2
a very tearful moment for me as the lion was in need of help and the other one come to help then they actually rolled in the grass to celebrate their victory amazing love that has been,2
the moment polar bear appeared behind the seal and the subsequent chase with long moment of suspension when we know nothing about the outcome is some of the finest nature moment captured on film,2
the way those first lions celebrated cuddled afterwards was too cute it s like they said that was a close call,2
man i m glad i clicked on this video these animal encounters are so beautiful all in their own unique way thank you for sharing,2
the lion was like thank god you came brother it was touching how grateful the lion was when his brother arrived these animals are amazing,2
i am very thankful for such a long amazing touching and emotional doc and for having sir david attenborough as the narator of most part of the video what a lovely gift have bbc offered us,2
you bring joy to people all over the world it is simply wonderful thank you very much this is probably the best video on a channel already full of incredibly beautiful videos the quality of the footage is on its own possibly the highest you can find on youtube im so glad i found this gem,2

o fato de the animals se reverenciar a n s no final do clipe me faz sentir falta desses tempos onde a era obra prima,1
esta melodia la recuerdo mucho pues es cuando mi mejor hermano se quito la vida y ahora la canto n honor a el te amo hermano,1
musicians play simple instruments no show no expensive costumes no expensive lighting effects only youth and talent and it turned out to be a masterpiece,2
this dude has the most amazing set of pipes his voice can echo through literal decades,2
im leaving my comment here so when someone likes it i can listen to this masterpiece again,2
i ve been looking for this song for age s and i finally found it and this is still a masterpiece,2
no dejemos morir la buena m sica tiene que quedarse para la eternidad,1

what a heroic defense of her cubs made the cougar mom loved it,2
the turtle segment is pure comedy bro was stuck on his shell helpless watching hurt,1
all he could do is look on humiliated as the victor claims his reward he was stuck on the side of his shell looking helpless,0
and the mother cougar is so much smaller than some of the massive male cougars that was amazing,2
i love this so much please do a part two i can watch this all day,2
i love watching these clips they really show you how powerful these animals really are,2
lol the tortoise segment was pure gold bro shot the fade and flipped him over helplessly then proceeded to clap tortoise cheeks and made em watch,2
i can t believe they just showed that tortoise hitting it from the back like that,0
the turtle segment is hilarious,2
the arsenal of weaponry the tactics the engagement pressed by an urgency the primal intent to disable like you dont play boxing nature dont play there is much to learn within these segments very much to learn,0
this song on full volume will result in either a speeding ticket or a pregnancy or both,0
and this song still at the top of my list the good music never dies,2
years later and i still love this song give nickelback all the undeserved hate you want i think theyre good,2
this song should be listened while driving at full speedlove this song,2
i never understood nickleback hate i love the dirty growl of their guitars and his rough voice,2
never understood the nickelback hate they were always really good imo,2
i grew up listening to nickelback i actively like them my parents have literally seen them live over times like come on,2
god i love this song so much it never understood the hate this band gets the guitar the voice and drums just rule,2
i have been listening to nickelback since i was yrs old this was the first song i heard and i still love them so much im yrs old now my first concert ever was nickelback nov ziggo dome amsterdam i really dont get why some people hate them they are amazing nickelback,2
say what you want about nickel back i was never a giant fan but the drums and bass in this song are top tier great song,2

dudes beating those drums like they owe him money,0
this song wants to make me tell my parents they can sleep in my room if theyre scared,1
my year old daughter dad what did he say me we re just a bunch of ducks and animals,1
listening to this whole album makes you stronger in the gym,2
different but i like it architects never disappoint,2
if youre still listening to this masterpiece youve a good taste in music architects never let me down,2
just found you guys after being recommend by a friend of mine he says you have to hear this song after listening to this on repeat for an hour i then found the album that is great from cover to cover you guys are what this genre needs badly you guys are tearin it upmuch respect,2
this is truly a masterpiece man i love the blend with the clean vocals and the very catchy chorus,2
this song makes me want to agree to the terms and services without reading them,2
i actually like the fact that every maroon is different from one another it makes them special they are a band that always keeps moving and doesnt get stuck in any sort of rut,2
a moment of silence for those kids who thought this was about animals,1
hidden meaning aside this song is a banger,2
meanwhile in a parallel universe just like humanshumans,1
the greatest music of all time never get bored of listening to it itd been years,2

essa m sica me inspira demais,1
i used to love this as a kid i still love it bc its so addicting,2
quase uma d cada dessa m sica estou envelhecendo,2
i m gonna say it if you knew this song s actual meaning before you were your either lying or lost your innocence too early in which case rip you my guy,0
i saw a silver fox once i was fourwheeling with my grandpa while he was out moose hunting and it ran right in front of us and it didn t even seem scared they are absolutely gorgeous in person pictures don t do them justice,2
that white lobster looks like its shell is made of opals and in most pictures here the akhalteke horses fur to me looked more pearlescent than golden truely stunning looking creatures one and all of them,2
ive seen a completely white peacock at a fair once it was beautiful and very friendly we werent allowed to touch him but they would walk around in an area and be very comfortable around people,2
once there was a fox near my house we live in almost in the middle of a large town my mom managed to record it but when we checked on our chickens one of them was gone we later found her hiding under our side porch the chicken that went missing was a polish chicken and i named them dawn,1
one time me and my family went to a bird sanctuary in florida while on vacation and saw one of the the only leucistic screech owls in the world his name was luna and he was nine years old about six years older than screech owls live in the wild,1
a note to the channel all peacocks are male females are peahens saying the male peacock is like saying the female cow,1
ive seen a blue lobster at an aquarium once pretty neat and very different from a standard lobster,2
ive seen three of those bicardinals and i never knew it was rare my grandma told me that it was because of the weather,1
i actually might have found a new species of cockroach yesterday it looks like a smokeybrown cockroach but it is small has a completely black thorax and is really fat and has really tiny antennae if anyone knows this species please tell me or maybe its a new species i discovered,1
albino snakes are probably one of the most common snake morphs seen in captive bred individuals they re not hard to come by at all also all the snakes you showed had black eyes albinos have red eyes so none of those snakes were actually albino most albino snakes i ve seen aren t pure white either they often have some yellow on them as well see albino burmese pythons hognose snakes and checkered garter snakes to name a few,1
a vida t o bela ali s o nosso planeta terra tem criaturas t o espl ndidas dizendo por outras palavras t o belas e graciosas eu amo tudo o que constitu do o nosso mundo desde uma pequena rocha uma planta e todos os seres como estes t o delicados e belos a vida sem eles n o somos nada e a vida t o bela,1
the music is so relaxing and seeing all of these amazing beings has made my day a whole lot better we certainly do need to protect all of them because earth would be terrible without any of them being around thank you for this video,2
oh wow great sounds and impressive pictures so great to just switch off relax and escape from everyday life should really be done regularly thank you great work and all the best,2
great this is one of the most wild raw videos i have ever seen beautiful animals spectacular scenery amazing music,2
,1
great filming beautiful and spectacular scenery and music but above all wonderful animals,2
nature is our key ally we need to reconnect with nature protect and restore it because the sad truth is almost all the stunning animals in this video are disappearing at an alarming rate but these videos do help with sharing the message and showing how beautiful and important nature and biodiversity is,2
this is probably the best video on a channel that is already full of videos that are incredibly beautiful the quality of the footage is in its own league possibly the highest quality you can find on youtube i am so glad that i found this gem and i m sorry for people who don t know this channel i hope there will be many more videos showing the beauty of many more places on this planet these videos give people the chance to see the world and the only thing they need is an internet connection you bring joy to people all over the world it s simply fantastic thank you so much,2
amazing nature and wildlife on earth,2

this is absolutely stunning i love the voice over there is always something special about watching nature and animals,2
documentaries of all kinds literally never fail to keep me intrigued especially animal crime or history ones,2
i absolutely love natureit just calming to me n watching the behavior of all the animals is very fascinating,2
this was absolutely incredible the beautiful area where so many are nourished the wonderful narration and the exquisite music what a wonderful combination plus the positivity of the focus that they will have all they need thankyou so much for doing this may be the best documentary ive ever seen,2
beautifully done without any animal hunting actions for a change very soothing,2
great documentary very peaceful and relaxing,2
these documentaries are always so relaxinglove em,2
i love nature and this wild life video make me feel good when watching and learning about the survival of the wild animals badly i feel simpathicaly for an elephant tunkbut am grand its strong and still using itthank alot for the video,2
i love nature documentaries about the lesser known parts of the world such interesting diversity and beauty,2
i appreciated this nature video so much especially because it did not show any killing except for the butterflies,2
not only were all four members of pink floyd phenomenal musicians and songwriters they were fortunate enough to have some great engineering and production folks to assist them in delivering music that will never die i cannot recall just how many times i spent in my bedroom with my headphones on just blissfully absorbed by animals didn t need shrooms or acid to trip to this masterpiece,2

this album is year old today and still an absolute banger,2
this could have been released today and it still would sound futuristic,2
it s hard to estimate how many times i ve listened to this album it doesn t really matter but i bought the vinyl in i was and here it is and it s as fresh as the first time i listened,2
one of the best albums ever made timeless,2
just a complete kick in the gut every time i hear it such a good album but goddamn dark af truly a masterwork,2
its blues its jazz its symphony and progressive rock rolled into one in a class by itself,1

i think baby elephants and lion cubs deserved an honorable mention,2
it was around the summer of when a friend and i went to the fresno zoo as we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water we watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water needless to say we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother we could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight later that night the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the zoo that day that baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals ive ever seen,2
i couldnt stop smiling throughout the entire video and my heart just glowed with an aura of golden love thank you so much for making our day brighter by showing all these adorable little darlings if i could id adopt one of each i hope that we humans will work together to save all these species and treat them with love i am so grateful that i was blessed with kitties and one dog throughout my life they were truly a gift from god many good wishes to you and all viewers,2
baby elephants are also adorable i thought it would have been included,2
my eyes are melting from the cuteness,2
i don t have a favorite because they are all so darn cute,2
baby cheetahs are actually really cute with their little mohawk looking furs i think so at least,2
the red panda just makes me die from cuteness,2
everything s adorable here but it bugs me that there are animals included that look similar but aren t the animal listed ex sloth bear in with the sloth chipmunk mixed in with squirrels and so on still all super cute,2
cuteness overload,2
my family actually saw a moose around that size it was insane,2
the alligator at is oh my god extremely huge and tall that was very surprising to me,2
this man is amazing because he talks on best fact,2
a vulture is meters ft kgs lbs yeah i dont think so,1
i live in australia average crocodile is ft,1
man i seen an moth like that at my aunt lol and then my sis started to say a story about her friend having a pet moth and she let it free lol,1
its usually not a vulture its a condor or a andean condor,1
the one that i thought was the craziest was the one right before the last one,1
moose aren t the size of deers do you usually feet and a deer is feet,1
i have seen one of those big spiders in my bathroom when my sister was just about to take a bath the spider was just hanging on the corner of our wall,0
as a rule fight s between two rhinos don t even end with injuries pretty certain that rhino fights have the highest mortality rate of any mammal other than humans,0
i cant even imagine what the poor warthog had gone through the air mr narratorthe air,0
the best part of this video is you getting the names of animals wrong the goat in the second clip made me roar,2
maybe years ago i saw a clip on tv that i dont see here of a fight between a tiger i assume male and a male lion in a clearing in a forest they fought for a while and then the lion ran away tigers are on average bigger and heavier than lions,1
the african leopard is the worst case scenario for humans a complete predator which intermediates between lions and cheetahs swift stealth agile and resentful you can run and climb but you cant hide,0
this lion fully has a horn in its bicep and its still trying to take a bite out of the buffalo savage,1
well made informative and entertaining ty for including imperial measurements i wish all makers would do the same,2
tigers have the size but lions live in packs and practice fighting other lions daily the first few years of their lives that in my opinion would give the lion the edge if a lion and tiger encountered each other,1
its nice to observe the wild animals fighting each other,2
i love how everybody comments on how he gets the names wrong lol,2
for those who dont knowthe giant megalodon is simply just a normal and harmless whale shark you can tell by the white spots covering its back and its round head though i am a believer of megs still existing its very clear from the gate way that this find isnt as rare or mega as they think,1
also i think what you call shapeshifter is a newly discovered type of squid the lights are possible for a sea creature as we see deep water has lights well its no underwater electricity but its something,2
for the megalodon vs whale i think that the creature that just scooped up the whale it not a shark it doesnt seem like a normal attack of a shark,0
i wasnt there and im not a marine biologist but the possible megalodon at is clearly a whale shark,1
pretty sure the shape shifter was a new species of deep sea squid there are various squids that have wedded tentacles such as the vampire squid also the ghost squid is a magnapinna squid no doubts about it it doesnt any different from any maganapinna squid ive ever seen their nick name is bigfin for a reason,1
the socalled turtle snake is a hoax the only thing real was the blurred out fish guts the rest was said most likely to be cardboard andor papierm ch,0
that poor kid still being scared even tho the shark is dead,0
the crocodile was terrifying,0
i believe that new england had its own giant hornets this summer i know because i was cleaning my kitchen and saw two very big hornets huge and scary its even scarier for me because im allergic to stings,0
it can take over the whole village from a shark fun fact sharks cant attack without water,1
nothing like hunting down a old song you just remembered,1

that dog that stopped the truck for its owner who was having a seizure is nothing short of incredible,2
you know we ve fallen short as a species when animals have to remind us how to show unconditional love for one another,0
that stray dog helping that lady had me in tears he is a keeper i wish he finds himself the family he deserves that dog right there was a real life hero protected a complete stranger as if his own master,2
it warms my heart to see animals trying to save other animals even a small fish where a human would have left it to die animals are so much smarter than we think they know things even we do not animals care way more than humans do they are not greedy but only take what they need and help others to survive even ones that are not of its own kind that is the true way to live in this world animals deserve so much more kindness than we give them next time you see a animal give it the respect and kindness it deserves,2
in my experience pets have demonstrated more humanity than humans ever did love the vid,2
the cats helping the disabled dog is a one in a million that no one would believe if it was not filmed,1
i fell out of tree once when i was young and it knocked the wind out of me really bad my german shepard ran up and grabbed my shirt and started pulling me to my back porch he was a good boy,2
animals are way more awesome and sensitive souls and more intelligent than most people give them credit for this was amazing,2
that dog helping his disabled owner is a beautiful being i love animals,2
mass respect to all these animals,2
cute animals love your videos super like as always a big kiss from mini yorkie yoshi au au au,2

when the husky was screaming mama i laughed so hard,2
,1
the dog jumping off the slide was a tad traumatic for me,0
a few are funny but some are cruel pets being teased till they retaliate is not good either,0
det h r var det roligaste p l nge,1
the bird was like yeah the view isnt as great but flying down here is so much easier and relaxing,2
he looks just like scoobydoo totally forgot how to do time stamps,2
xd,1
i love baby,2
i had to go to the hospital after seeing that one,0
after reading comments i agree i felt ripped off so i decided to search for fattest giraffe and there are many copies of that particular photo with a few that have been squished or spread to make it look even fatter yet there was also one sitting in someones hand suspicious i know but i was more amazed to find a very overweight tiger one animal i would not expect to get fat also huge prairie dog and a very fat horse some animals labelled morbidly obese could turn up more,0
its so sad to see the ones that were truly loved by their elderly owners they never meant to harm their fur babies,0
i wish they had more footage on deep blue there are only two videos of her that i know about that original one and the one where they saw her off the coast of hawaii just watching her swim around impresses me she is huge,2
one of the fish in the goldfish section isn t even a goldfish it is a cichlid hybrid called a parrot fish,1
even though they might look happy they most certainly arent that hedgehog is living his best life gets to eat all day and gets plenty of attention,2
theres an obese rabbit in my neighborhood hes a wild one and nobody knows how he got so big but hes become popular enough that theres a couple slow down for wildlife signs i think hes probably living in a garden or maybe stealing outdoor pet food,1
im aussie and the way he said kukaburra had me laughing so hard i fell of my bed,2
i went to the state fair in dallas texas and there was a pig weighted pounds they turned him every half hour and big red cows some with their babies it was so interesting,2
can we just appreciate how oshine picked up the toy after she fell off xd,2
this song hits different now that im listening to this on a late night in the middle of june,2
to be real when i first heard this song i immediately love it and honestly the vibe is great as well,2
am i the only one to who this song makes me feel an indescribable feeling feels kinda nostalgic btw,2
i feel my mind calm down and i foget everything and vibe to the songdont let this song die,2
este tema le encanta a mi nene de a os,2
dave dancing to the empty theater just makes me wanna cry,0
umas das melhores musicas sem duvidas,2
the song makes you remember nostalgic things when the song itself isn t nostalgic it s a normal box of nostalgia when it becomes older it becomes nostalgia a box of nostalgia the box is made out of nostalgia what a amazing song,2
this song still gives goosebumps even after years,2
started hearing this song on the radio literally everyday i really like this record,2
i love your animals and your content,2
it s awesome to see how far your zoo has come it looks amazing but i think your macaws would be a lot happier in a larger enclosure,2
they will be so happy with you so cool i appreciate you being so awesome to the animals you take such good care of them,2
hey jacob your animals are absolutely beautiful and precious you do a fantastic job in caring and loving them keep up the amazing work and videos they are truly amazing,2
i love your animals soooooo much,2

that s so cool thank you for making videos i love your vids,2
great episode buddy finally a full zoo tour,2

many of the examples of leopards you showed were actually jaguars,1
one of my favorite sites to visitlove it and thank you for such an informational site on wildlife,2
in my imaginations i thought i could out run a wild animalbut damn kmhr for a hyena i would be dead in secs,0
largest known animal on earthblue whale best sea predatororca a cheetah is not a leopard otherwise good vid,2
the camera people deserve our appreciation,2

we wish you all the very best for your future life may everything that you do make you happy and rise,2
i love your videos keep goingyou are great,2
new album for those that wish to exist out now,1
you know you ve reached the top of the metal mountain when you get a whole orchestra to play a breakdown,1
dont care what anyone says an orchestra puts so much more oomph and power behind a song like this now its on a completely different level,2
the orchestra looks like they are enjoying it and that makes me really happy,2
whoever arranged the orchestral parts is brilliant instead of the usual treatment of trying to fit the song into an orchestral piece they fit the orchestra to the song this has got to be one of the best if not the best orchestral versions of a hard rockmetal song ive seen,2
as a trumpet player i have to give a huge shout out to the low brass that brought the bass line and bad ass sound of this song through,1
i m a violinist in an orchestra and i listen to architects this is like the best thing ever happened in my life,2
this needs to be on spotify asap,2
now this is some fucking awesome music amazing,2
this needs to be on spotify now please the people have spoken goosebumps,2
he could break right through that glass leave it alone i have a gun most floridian thing ive ever heard,0
i love how the puma and the human are basically yelling the same shit at each other,0
well there goes the end of my tarp fishing calmly tells a big ass crocgator to get back,0
now when you play with lionsits important to never show fear,1
i have encountered bears while hiking in alaska photographed the in my pic but the mountain lion clips actually freaked me out the most,0
that shirtless guy nearly gave me a heart attack when the snake was coming and he was leaving the baby and so slow getting in the house to close the door if it wasn t for the other guy who did everything faster it was going to end bad,0
i like how the cyclist immediately surrendered to the moose,2
one of the most scariest encounters ever,0
oh my god guys there s an octopus eating a crab then watches it like a action movie,0
the bear chase at is unforgivable a real shame the bear missed,0
broim watching this at night and at first i thought i was dreaming,1
voc muito criativa parab ns,2
im thinking of wolf demons when i hear this song this means its super good,2
this is the best song ever im so glad you made it in gacha,2
me remembering this months later xd its still gud,2
amei,2
i like how you included the parents in the background when she howls,2
i love this i subed and this is amazing,2
in the animal kingdom the ability to hide disguise yourself blend in to your surroundings and be unseen not only affords you safety from predators but can also make you a deadly hunter in the african savannah zebra graze on grasses they seemingly disappear into in the madagascan jungles chameleons change the color of their skin to suit the trees they climb in the warm tropics mantis blend in amongst the foliage as they hunt their prey the octopus becomes one with the great barrier reef with apparent supernatural ability polar bears and the arctic fox disappear in the blinding snow as they scour the arctic tundra penguins play unseen by predators in antarctica and the snow leopard rules the mountains of southeast asia animal armory takes a closer look at these fantastical superpowers and the animals that wield them watch animal armory episode here freedocumentary nature,1
love this documentary so much the narrator is amazing also lets not forget the writer andy mitchell thank you for making this available for free,2
fantastic documentary hope we as humans preserve all of the species and for that matter all animalplant life for generations to come snow leopards are just astonishing,2
this is times better than any movie thanks so much love to the production management,2
i can actually feel whats shown here without actually being there in the wild beautiful creatures and masterfully lensed,2
i love the goose noises coming from the crow at and the horse noises for the zebras totally accurate,2
there is a big mistake in this the dazzle camouflage doesnt work to hide the zebra in the grass its designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target so when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws the same thing was used against submarines,0
is this original footage or from somewhere else regardless it looks freakin fantastic the editing is superb,2
just finished watchingwonderful episode brilliant subject matter relaxing intriguing music exquisite cinematography lee perry has such a commanding presence as narrator yet calm serene animal armory series has quickly become my new favorite thnx so much for this lovely program perfect for rainy day in ny,2
its good and funny to see how animals cares for each other specially the goat and the chickens,2
that giraffe was pretty amazing body slamming then stomping with such precision i had no idea they could defend themselves like that,2
the way that raccoon got flung had me dying lmao,0
incredible vid we all possess the inherent right of selfdefense the bees revenge on the hornet was masterful,2
love how the female cutely flops away,2
i really love how the frog scapes from the snake,2
the way the old man hit the alligator it s funny because your just hear a bonk bonk,1
the way he used a frying pan showed me how powerful i would be with it,2
that actually got my belly broken xd,0
the favorite for me was when the goat who had nothing to do with the fight seemingly went over to defend the chicken from the hawk,2
wtf was that bard stun hello,1
wow so cute congrats love from romania,2
thank you for bringing joy to all of us with your work god bless you,2
thanks for sharing cutest ever,2
i love it so much its so cute,2
the animals are so cute,2
so cute love from pakistan happy day to all of you,2
i have a hugehuge ratphobiaso i know i dont wanna encounter an albino rat the size of a small fully grown dogthe sight alone will most probably kill me,0
love the videos but surprised you didn t mention polar bear or shark whale,2
i love animal videos but this one has some flat out incorrect information elephants for example do not find humans cute spreading that kind of information is what leads people to underestimating an animal and getting themselves hurt wild animals are just that wild they can be socialized but that does not mean tame or domesticated,0
did he said the blue wale is about pounds,1
thanks for another great vid so interesting but damn im so glad theres a screen between me and most of these animals,2
thank you for saying the lion is the king of the savannah lions dont live in jungles,1
you showed walruses and stellar sea lions when discussing elephant seals,1
i have video footage of a elk ripping the front of my brother in laws pick up truck apart he was pissed of at my brother in law because he made the sound of a male that thing was yards away when he did that and let me tell you i felt like i barely made into the truck in time that was only feet from us ive never seen such power in real life it was insane that was on vancouver island just for your info,0
i thought there was a type of albatros thats bigger than a condor or did i hear that wrong,1
very interesting video but according to wikipedia great white sharks have bite force lbs you said lbs i believe so which is accurate,2
i just finished college all these years of schooling have been mostly miserable now i spend a lot of time learning things on youtube for fun and out of curiosity,0
i often watch this ted talk when needing extra encouragement as a home educator may you rest in peace sir ken robinson thank you for sharing your wisdom,2
the sad thing is this was posted years ago and nothing has changed in the school system,0
who is here after learning about his passing rest in peace dear sir rest in peace youve inspired many including myself and well do our best to continue carrying your torch,2
teacher grade is just a number also teacher judges your future because of your grades,1
it wasnt until i left school that i discovered how interesting learning can be including what in school i found tedious,2
this man made more sense in minutes than a whole committee in years and years of planning and execution,2
this is why field trips are soooo good they create an atmosphere of curiosity and learning its sad how in high school we get much less,2
and that is why i have learnt much more on youtube than in school,2
gran v deo pero perm tanme hablar de algo importante veo que muchos j venes y viejos cometen errores que creo que no deber an ser creo que todos j venes o mayores deber an tener un plan de inversi n que aumente su rendimiento financiero de tres cifras a seis cifras la inversi n puede ser tu plan de jubilaci n o plan de futuro seg n lo que quieras pero lo m s importante es que tengas una inversi n que sea rentable,1
you forgot the most important function of school to make children hate learning,0
i hope you all realize the incredible scope of possibilities and opportunities you introduce to young people today for the most part i think you do and i appreciate all the commitment and energy which shows in the outcome every time i think of crash course and the whole insights and enlightenment genre of youtube for that matter i think of for want of a nail and i wonder what id be doing now if the possibilities you introduce to viewers with such comparative ease in this time wouldve been around in the s thank you,2
this channel is getting me through university,2
thank you crash coarse team for continuing to give fun and thoughtful educational material for us all,2
i love that as part of additional recourses for our sociology class we have these videos it is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that its focused a lot on american context d which is true because from this video it looks like usa has one of the best educational systems which is deffinetly not true here in the czech republic compulsory school attendance functions since also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools public or private of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than usa but i dont think you have the best one but its just my opinion so please dont come at me d,2
a more cynical perspective on why public statefunded education became so popular and important for industrialized countries is because their workers now required more knowledge in order to be efficient they needed to be able to read and write and have basic numeracy skills to operate machines if the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use worryingly the same is happening nowadays many companies complain that people leave collegeuniversity and are not prepared to enter the workforce they want someone else to teach people to be good efficient workers so that the employer can make the most of their staff from day,1
educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition neighborhood preconceptions of people and income which affects how much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil student it s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in loved the references you used as well james,2
pleaseeee do these for uk sociological structures because most of your videos have helped my alevels so far and are incredibly helpful,2
there needs to be more focus in school on how to think and less on what to think most kids learn how to memorize material and pass tests but only certain kids verse themselves well enough to approach extra credit problems that werent covered in class and actually require thought,1
we are teaching our children the wrong things in school we are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections this means when one section fails then the rest also fail we need to teach our children to be independent instead we teach children how to be obedient workers to give meaning to someones life teach them how to grow their own food build their own house repair their own car cook their own meals eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray this gives life meaning,0
interesting my learning style is slow,2
my grade science project back in the late s was on learning styles my teacher was shocked and surprised when i submitted my project idea all my subjects were my classmates over a span of a couple weeks i tested their comprehension of certain short stories pictures and videos through visual audio and reading when the science fair day came my booth wasnt the most popular with any of the other kids but with all the school teachers and parents they loved it i remember the results of my project was inconclusive because i tested each student individually with each individual method of learning no one method of learning is better than another but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen but i ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due,2
i worked as a high school teacher for thirty years over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory learning style was just one of many nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof ever yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher so you had no choice at least whilst being observed i became quite cynical in the end because i realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their cv and each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one god forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,0
i had an excellent and very intense mathematical statistics professor for whom varying teaching style was his teaching style i recall one day for an hour long lecture he came in and wrote notes and provided examples and proofs and he never said a single word in another day he switched his handwriting to beautiful perfect cursive he was a bizarre teacher but pushed me to the absolute limit great prof,2
i ve been selfstudying alevel maths for the last two years and i think the real method to learning in my own experience is repetition similar to how you would work out in a gym the more you do it the better you become at it i think i ve taught myself more in the last two years than any of my teachers ever did in school,2
im a pressure learner i only learn school material when theres severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me,0
people learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic also if you understand schooling as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades and education as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know but also that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually making people dumber,0
im a teacher in new zealand and vark was covered in my teaching degree years ago we did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching ie try and give the children a verbal aspect and an auditory aspect and a reading aspect and a kinaesthetic aspect that sounds more like the multimodal approach you described i remember i came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well she looked at it and said i dont want to read all that cant you read it to me,2
i feel like the learning styles myth has ultimately helped teaching though its encouraged teachers to be more multimodal in their teaching style in order to in their minds reach a wider variety of learners even if the hypothesis was wrong its ultimately created a stronger teaching style,2
twenty years ago i gave a small talk about vark to my fellow educators the key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate but complement each other in a holistic manner over years i have found many keys to assisting students to learn humour comfort having eaten slept well etc pause frequently to review points question your own knowledge openly and invite students to do the same as they learn i loved teaching and was only persuaded to finish when the paperwork before and after took more time than the educating,2
im glad i live in the age of the internet i learn every day ive never stopped being a student,2
its official im opening a school like this if im rich when im older or maybe even if im poor i really dont care i just want a school like this,2
i personally believe children and students should be taught to think for themselves they should learn to debate solve problems and be encouraged,2
this video speaks to my soul im training to be a teacher at the moment and its not what i imagined i dont feel like its what i should do with my life but this video has revived me slightly and reminded me that this wasis my vision and not to be bogged down by the current system awesome videos,2
every single one of these videos is perfectly made with amazing points everything is so well thought out these videos make the world a better place,2
i am a teacher i love my job and i need to tell you this is happening in schools it is pushed for students to learn and understand life problems we call it the hidden curriculum it is what teachers facilitate in their classrooms teachers put students in many situations and help guide them in appropriate ways or guidance about finding themselves and their interests or understanding money which is definitely in the curriculum you are correct it is not as blatant as this example and i wish it were more but your next video i would love to see your solution to this problem the education system knows this is where we want to go they just dont know how,2
great video i look forward to teaching my children these valuable lessons if the current curriculum doesnt go over these important subjects,2
schools definitely needs to teach the various biases and fallacies funny thing about them is that by simply knowing people will commit much less of them this is one of the purest example of knowledge is power and most certainly belongs in a curriculum,2
great work the school of life its really heart warming that you made an effort to study the current education system and provided with a simple solution like focusing on the life challenging subjects having said that i dont want this to be just anther video i want us all to collaborate and design a real time working ed system test and work on it at small scale first then making it biggerlater because i dont want the future and the current generation to suffer the same fate as we did peace,2
as someone who grew up doing common core it just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other common core materials for essentially no benefit to the students i can t recall a single time common core was spoken of positively by the teachers or the other students,0
i think we can all agree the schools need to incorporate financial education all throughout high school,1
so we found that the problem wasn t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in and rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame it was easier to say kids aren t learning because there s something wrong with the books teachers and schools i love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance now we ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live,0
i dropped out of high school when i was held back in th grade and got my ged at weeks before my th birthday the ged tests were way easier than end of the year tests in regular school,2
what most people dont understand is that basic education is culture you cant just write a list of things to learn you need to design an engaging environment for people to receive information and play out tests you also need to include the parents of children to make them understand and play in key of the curriculum,1
ive taught the alevels uk and the floridamichigan curriculum at international schools the us has a lot less focus than the uk americans are confused about what raising standards really entails foreign curriculum pushes students to master a smaller set of skills with smaller textbooks and more essay writing whereas the us focuses on a wider range of concepts with superficial multiple choice polling often this leads to foreign students having mastery and being well spoken about foundational concepts while american students win trivia night but cant really explain why the know something,1
education is used to separate and maintain the social classes in the states rich only chooses the private to avoid public broken system,1
schools need to push to hold back students instead of pushing them to a level out of their league until they give up the students that are showing much slower growth need to be put into an alternative careerlife focused schoolclassesprogram,0
lets perform it on a positive note the culture and ecology have to be healthy for starters schools have to be safe and secure it has to be supportive of learning curve for the students the student must take extreme ownership of the curricula the subject matters must be based on science learning methods must be evidencebased yes im a seasoned stem teacher by the way,2
apologies for not watching the whole video as a former student and a parent of students i know the system was broken long before common core i remember in college my english teacher had to give me a grammar guide because i was so deficient on the basicsthough i did well in english all through school i had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough i graduated with the required credits things have gone down since i was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations that means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure they had to take history and social studies but only had to pass one the policy of no child left behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to teach we have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them schools arent just expected to educate students now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying ieps head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings with all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook common core like no child left behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation my kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated there was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students it meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task at the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure they promoted the best teachers out of the classroom they took away teaching assistants due to the costs they increased class sizes and they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way,0
a very truthful talk thank you ms jayne,2
i love the passion and professionalism of the teachers i work as an educator,2
fabulous message love the roads analogy with education,2
great job jayne,2
differentiation accommodation and special ed hinge the diversity and inclusion in the world we are living,1
really useful video bravo i sub it,2
succinctly espectacular,1
words,2
very good,2
wow amazing,2
support public education,2
im amazed how the people behind this channel make such attractive fun animation while turning what couldve been hours of lectures and studying into a minute video,2
while working on my masters in education one faculty member told me that in his opinion our schools were designed to babysit our kids so the parents can work,1
i find it utterly interesting and a bit paradoxical to see deweys progressive ideas presented through a short and well made lecture which utilizes state of the art instructional design it really tells us that the art form of lecturing is rather timeless,2
i am studying john deweys philosophy this video really makes me understand more clear on his principles such attractive fun animation and clear explanation,2
ive been studying with the traditional academia style from my chidhood and i think this was one of the reasons of my deep unhappiness everytime i had to go to the school and i agree the system can be totally useless when it comes to study died things in only books and not providing experiential oportunities to learn for children its a very serious matter that i hope will dramatically change very soon i adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but i can tell not in life sharing my experience all the best to you guys,0
when i went to school in the sixties there was one program one track and it all revolved around completing workbooks memorizing facts and spewing them back in exams and in addition being judged on academic performance if memorizing and spewing dates and other facts counts as performance we were given a grade for citizenship a good grade in citizenship meant you didnt give the teachers any trouble you had learned to go along to get along a bad grade meant you were trouble and got a lot of negative attention from the vice principal i spent most of school particularly middle school in terror of making someone mad or being different it was a hateful experience,1
thanks well done sprouts and the visuals are just amazing deweys theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for education it it is therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one a critic would be how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus for the discussions it is important that some teacher instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussiondebate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas for the interdisciplinary aspect to work very strong school leadership is essential as well as a strong teamwork culture among staff as it would require a lot of sharing consultations planning and constant reviews,2
my school was too crowded for everyone to flourish i have not seen any change in the last years since i graduated ranked choice voting is much needed now i reeducated my self after i turned it took me years to realize how little they thought me,0
thank you for this shirt video it really helps me trying to get through deweys texts i am writing my pedagogy vision which is influenced by dewey,2
dont be lazy in learningthese words in my mind forever,2
never stop learning coz life never stops teaching,2

this video speaks to me in so many ways being afraid to make mistakes and always overthinking over things i either have no control over worldly affairs or things that has already been done,1
as he said learning is the key i really wanna put it on my life,2

i want the transcript of this video to read everyday in the morning it it possible to download it anywhere online,2
this thing is also evident in india students preparing for neetjee and for many other competitive exams who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who cant afford to go to these coachings most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are iitians doctors etc these coachings provide great facilities to their students so the results are obvious there are very few government colleges of class and in india who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams also what i have noticed is that its not just the school that you go to matters but also the kind of peer group which you have also the support and thinking of your parents and the overall society and environment in which live matters when it comes to education,2
an education that prepares learners for life after school i would really love to see this in my country we are trained to seek jobs so may graduates are frustrated by the education system most of them end up studying by staying in school all their lives as a defense mechanism our education needs to teach the mind heart and hands for us to be a bit more successful,1
this is soo true but the real situation is even more dull for the sake of the work schools are providing the online classes to the students without considering whether they have or havent necessary access to the resources this malice is pervading in rural regions more abruptly,0
agreeing with you i got into public school in kerala and afterward for college i got a scholarship thanks to that i have no education loan we should focus on the education and financial equality of the society so that people have upward mobility and people others as well,2
im from india and here students can get admission to all the big universities only through an entrance exam due to covid the exams were postponed in april which is the usual time they happen now when the country has hit peak infection the central government has decided to hold all the exams at least million students attempt these exams each year despite the clamour from the students and opposition the government is proceeding with it students have a long list of various concerns that are brushed aside due to the rains many regions are flooded families displaced and property destroyed transportation is nearly impossible some states have still not lifted the lockdown so trains buses and taxis are either unavailable or charge exorbitant rates the exam centres are few and far between particularly in the rural areas without means of transportation students are unable to reach the exam centres even if they do manage to arrange for transport as hotels and restaurants are closed or open only for takeout they cannot find safe accomodation many of the students have applied to multiple universities offering same or similar programs they all have entrance exams in september if a student tests positive due to any of these exams either he cannot take the exam or he infects hundreds of others when he attempts the paper despite the illness and like always the poor and disadvantaged in the country are suffering the most in this situation the government has offered no explanation or assurances for safety this is a no win situation for both students and their families the government has no solution that affects millions of students education and career other than to postpone the exam or hold the exam this is the state of education in india right now due to an incompetent government,1
great piece tom this issue needs more attention in the media,2
we also need to teach students how to learn einstein himself said i do t teach my students i give my students an optimal environment for learning and they learn by themselves paraphrased sure yes quality teaching is ver fundamental but without teaching them how to learn they would be dependent on other people rather than independent,1
this issue needs more attention from everyone very nice work done by the cnbc team to highlight this issue in your report,2
a voice from cambodia i came from a state owned school and finished my high school examination with a grade then i enrolled in a state owned university and completed my bachelor degree last month recently i joined a management trainee program to compete with other fresh graduate students in order to earn the top spots to be qualified one of them was a girl that graduated from foreign countries she spent years in singapore and one year in australia and i can see clearly see the difference between us in term of languages skills and knowledge it s hard to stay being optimist because in reality students from rural areas in my countries don t even know how to properly use a computer while those in urban areas ace this skill and other multiple skills since they were young to my knowledge one of the possible ways right now is to enrich the english language to the disadvantaged students and also creating high quality educating contents in our own language namely khmer ideally i hope those students will obtain the proficiency in english language then study the contents that suit their interests through educational media that vastly available at hand now,1
in my opinion the most important thing which determines the educational performance of the child is whether hisher parents value education or not everything else is secondary,1
this is arguably one of psyquis best beat drops,2

love how psyqui started out with the amen break and turned into something from a rhythm game amazing track,2
if school felt like this no one would ever leave,1

just so were clear army drill sergeants arent allowed to do a lot of this stuff in most countries sleep deprivation and injuries kills actual learning regardless how determined everyone is,0
i used to work for those online tutoring companies they wanted native english speakers and promised you but would dock your pay for things like yawning on screen the pace was insane i was fired for not smiling enough the burnout rate was very very high especially because you had to get up at about am to do it if you lived in america the kids would be really young the youngest i tutored was too young to understand anything at all and be in pajamas and finishing up their dinner so like the last thing they wanted to do was stare at a computer and learn english especially because the age range seemed to be yearolds sometimes they would pick up the laptop they were on and just run around the room with it and the parents would give us bad marks for not keeping their child engaged enough it was a really horrible job for both companies i worked for,0
in kenya i experienced the same the kcse is the one exam that can make or break your life i slept for hours a day lessons from am to pm it was stressful the pressure from parents and society is sometimes too much i am glad it is all gone,0
my god this actually gives me an understanding of why there are so many international students from china who board at my school especially students in my year year to get an education which is actually constructive and without the burden of social status being dictated by marks etc ill have to replay this video when ever i start to complain about my education being hard because it is nothing compared to this,1
im this year and am studying in an international high school in shenzhen china i was in public school until high school im grateful my parents provided me the opportunity to leave that stressful system but i heard from my former classmates who are in the system that in recent years the pressure on that system has been declining but i cant be assured because im no longer in that system recalling my dark days in that system ive always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages when you fail to remember them teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times i understand the reason why our government has such a system because we have such a vast population and i do think its relatively fair even though its fairness is declining especially when this double reduction policy came down,0
ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,0
my sons were in chinese public schools until th and th grade respectively i am french and their mom and chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system until the th grade the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work now as bicultural kids they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son from th grade onwards the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave bullying by teachers can also occur my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates this reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden what it didnt do is address some fundamental issues with the system teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students instead they push them out everything is based on tests one in grade and one in grade these tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills even if that has improved a bit system should be reformed to take equivalent of gpa into account this would ease a lot of the pressure the last years of high school are spent on passing exams rather than help students grow there is a little that is learnt in those years to help them transition to higher education yes most of them will have strong language and math skills but a lot of it is mechanical some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum,1
education has become competitive for parents to make their children worthy in this world to competent other for their future its not only happening in china in other fast growing cities its better to divide studies according to grade rather pressure the kid at early agenowadays parents are feeding kids with vitamins and many nutrients to improve their brain function but they didnt think the world most top renowned scientists never had this facilities,1
the problem i have with those overly stressful education systems is that i wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them what i learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn in selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes the military seems to do it too in their own way i would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue its funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stressfree education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months i wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries here in france we dont have that type of education system nor in the united kingdom i studied for years at a british university,0
i never really agreed with this kind of education system i live in malaysia my earliest childhood memories were ever only filled with tuitions left and right no play until you finish your homework if you fail to memorise spellings you will be punished back then i never really thought much of it but now that i m in college being exposed to a more western type of education system made me question this kind of practice it never helpd me improve my academic i was always dead last in class all it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety im never going back to those times,0
i am a teacherand i approve this message,2
with college diplomas decreasing in value and severe student debt increasing in presence this song is becoming truer every year,1

thank you god for this beautiful year now i can chill listening to this song in peace with no school pressure feels,2
someone should sing this to the government,1

as a new teacher this video really inspires me to make a difference in my own school it wont be easy definitely but the idea is there,2
im watching in years later and i feel like theres still no change,0
i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty,2
this man needs a noble prize,1
ive been listening to this guys speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything i have seen in a long time i was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school this wonderful psychologist actually told me in th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so i know so i spent years believing i had adhd when all i had was this thing called childhood eventually in th grade i switched to an alternative school and everything robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on im a senior at my alternative school going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me ill spare the details but i just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what im most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and i will do everything in my power to achieve this i wouldnt have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity much thanks to ken robinson for his words of wisdom and innspiration andsharing his vision with us,2
rip to this legendary genius thank you ken for everything you taught us,2
i certainly remember being much better at being creative when i was younger but now that im a freshman in high school ive noticed that im much worse at the whole creativity thing now the problem is im being praised why i am great at finding the one answer i can take tests very well but am typically not the best at projects math is my best subject english is my worst where you typically have to write creative essays i want to be an engineer so at my school we have an elective called preengineering its one of the closest classes to an actual job thats available at my school and im not the best at it sure i can do the math required but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard i feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future its telling me that theres one answer which is never the case in engineering i hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul and realize that we need to change education,0
so much truth in one video my philosophy teacher who is a very intelligent and beautiful woman showed us this as part of the course but afterwards she was really emotional because she didnt want to mark our creative essays anymore but she had to because of the system shed rather just read all we create and give comments and enjoy it but the grading ruins it all,1
i watch this every now and then for inspiration love the kids and profession if not necessarily the system,2
i now have a whole new appreciation for having learned history at school and having had some great teachers and lecturers once i got to university with history theres never only one true answer for every question you ask because everyone views the world differently from culture to culture religion to religion even between generations which is why history gets revised so much to answer the questions that each era asks youre free to come up with any ideas of your own so long as you have the evidence to back it up,2
guy has an existential crisis whilst speedrunning a popular game altered for educational purposes,0
in bedrock sometimes portals are just that hard to find i remember blowing up a stronghold for like an hour then finally finding the portal,0
i love the way he makes everything heroic as if its in an old tale at least everything after the stronghold,2
this went from a speedrun into an epic tale with a whole ass redemption arc,1
this guy is so poetic while he s exploring this foreign port of minecraft it s so fun to watch he speaks with such enthusiasm like one of those audiobook narrators that read books out loud to you i really admire that,2
the lesson we learned today never mess with bedrock edition bosses,1
after reading a few comments i would like to clarify that in bedrock both now and at the time of this video portal rooms are kind of bugged and will spawn disconnected from the stronghold there will be no hallways connecting to it and are usually just behind a few block thick wall or even up to several blocks away,1
i ve gotten really good at speedrunning education edition after i saw a lot of my friends do it my best is i think that s really good,2
i love how he makes the speedrun feel so alive,2
just in case you didnt know bedrock edition has a chance of not having a portal room this makes it really hard for speedrunners to use bedrock because if they get to the strong hold in just minutes it might not even have a portal room,0
noone has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do powerful words i live by that,1
fact we learn more on the internet from travelling and meeting people than we have at school,2
i used to write so well and elaborate descriptions were super easy my pen flowed on paper like butter but ever since my teacher screamed at me for exceeding the word limit in the exam i got so discouraged that i gave up on writing and now i cant even write a simple essay school really does kill creativity dont let that happen to you,0
these creative children have turned into these teenagers who are unwilling to think outside the box im only and i felt that in my soul,0
this is extremely true one example my brother is amazing at art hes super talented but he keeps getting cs and ds in art because he doesnt do what hes told he challenges the teachers there are people in his class who jave absolutely no skill but get higher grades because the do exactly what they are told and dont think outside the box the teachers are literally trying in limit children creativity in an art room,2
education is when you learn from your mistakes school is where you get mocked for your mistakes,0
everyone is intelligent but our grades made us idiots jabin baret,0
how i learn a language at school memorizing a k word essay by heart memorizing long idioms by heart memorizing twenty word literature questions by heart scores well for test forgets everything what i leaernt after a day,1
what parents expect from us during school constant straight a s good social life all that what they don t expect stress depression social awkwardness school just sucks having to determine all self worth on a high or low grade just makes you upset and then fear what happens as a consequence i hate how parents don t understand that school can genuinely give a child depression and mental health issues because they refuse to think like their child they always say that we aren t depressed just faking it for attention i had a mental breakdown once all i was asked was why did i cry and that there had to be a reason a person should not have a damn reason to express themselves it s just bs,0
i loved my th and th grade math teacher his goal was to make the class love math he said he loved when people failed and he also only checked homework because the school system made him he did the best he was allowed to and this goes to show that you shouldnt blame the teachers you shouldnt blame the people who designed the school system around years ago you should blame the people who keep the school system the same never changing it to suite modern needs more modern schools are near identical to ones over years ago which were designed to mass produce factory workers let that sink in,2
its true education is a neverending process i feel formal education doesnt teach you to learn from your failures but rather punish you,0
absulotely a very useful one and i learned today to spread this knowledge as much as i can,2
education is discipline if you know its important although you just have to go through with it you ll definitely go places on the other hand there are many who think they wont learn a thing there these are the people who can t work except dreaming about doing the next big thing because of their lack of discipline,1
in starting its boring but later we love it,2
i agree with this on so many levels it s weird take my like,2
who is behind this channel this is very kind and honest step to aware others in real thanks for this i really appreciate and loving this work of yours,2
we should improve and educate ourselves to succeed,2
thanks for the videonow i realise why education is so importanti have read and studied about abraham maslow but yet i cnt figure it out myself not until now,2
not gonna lie what i learned at school what i learned on youtube,1
thank you for your amazing video,2
as a year veteran teacher i suggest that you talk to teachers about their working conditions the disrespect has infected the classrooms teachers are being verbally and physically attacked by students and even parents on a daily basis a lot of this stems from mental health issues yet nothing is ever done about it,0
low wages harassment bullying karens lack of security respect paperwork working conditions pay safety updated and fact based books etc plus who the heck wants to worry about being murdered at their job not having security taken seriously by those in charge this will never happen at are school attitude,0
its hardly surprising even in rich districts teachers are underpaid undervalued and overworked they are expected to take on more responsibilities every year with fewer and fewer resources all while administrators ignore their pleas and parents treat them like overqualified babysitters my wife quit teaching several years ago she was working days a week and spending hundreds of dollars a month on supplies just to keep her classroom running and the school gave her absolutely no support with unruly students,0
respect for teachers is not just about the salary although an increase in salary is sorely needed teacher pay has always been lower than other professions with the same education and experience its also about respect for the profession student behavior in my view can be linked to the disrespect for teachers theyre seeing parents administrators and politicians demonstrate hiring a person trained as a soldier to teach is very disrespectful to the profession as a teacher i dont feel qualified to do the job of a soldier i respect the profession too much the anybody can teach attitude is not only insulting its ignorant,0
who wants to get shot in the classroom while trying to protect these disrespectful students who cuss you out on a daily basis,0
i was raised in a teaching family when the profession was respected and teacher strikes unheard of fast forward to a major university where teaching majors walk away from the profession after their first classroom experiences why would any sane person want to be in a job when they are disrespected or not trusted so much,0
when parents start teaching basic morals respect and integrity youll see more teachers wanting to be in the same classroom until such time i doubt well see a rise with educators,1
a lot of comments virtually no one citing the elephant in the room systemic racist school funding based upon property taxes other countries insist that every school district be funded the same these countries are consistently rated at the top in worldwide education surveys and results btw these countries also fully fund health care and mental health too,1
decades of we need to cut the education budget created an environment where supplies are now being provided at cost to the teachers larger classes low respect with more flak being thrown their way this year due to bs rhetoric denigration from political grand standers and then pile on top this push for parents wanting to directly interfere in the teachers professional conduct you have caused the great resignation of teachers own up to it and fix your funding priorities,0
so it turns out that if you underpay and undervalue teachers nobody wants to be a teacher huh go figure,0
bernie thank you for giving the proper voice to this critical issue biden threw a bone much more help for regular people is needed systemic change is needed in the educational debt industry,2
because a healthy and educated country is a strong country thank you senator sanders for all you do,2
the cost of education in this country is crazy if we want to have an educated workforce we need more affordable education,0
here we are in the th century in the usa and education is a luxury something is very wrong with this picture thank you bernie for your deft combination of common sense and wisdom,0
stop funding wars and start funding education and health care its taxpayer money let we the people vote on how to spend it,0
its outrageous that union organizers are excluded from the debt forgiveness program sounds like something the republicans and corporate dems would have agreed to include in the bill,0
bravo bernie a good argument for education and training is you will need less of the welfare state not more,2
so sad why are federal student loan interest rates so high we need workers with skills in this country my husband died at and his one wish was to pay off our daughter s graduate school loan and our daughter in law s undergraduate loan i did that and now have a new granddaughter we need to lift this burden to help all with this kind of debt,0
incredible we have to starve the narcissists of people to do business with bernie thank you bernie for getting our weak voices out there with complaints that we can view publically so we know we are not alone that there are people both in our shoes and also those willing to help from their care for us and our problems,2
bernie for president,2
i m years old and have lived my entire life in mississippi is a huge win in that every time i have observed state rankings regarding quality of life issues we are nearly always the reason we have come up in the rankings is that my daughter is a teacher in the mississippi public school system and she raised mississippi s ranking seven points by herself i am very proud,2
number is not too shabby but near dc more resources are given to novanorthern va while in rural counties and sova southern va teachers sometimes use their own money to buy school supplies still when my daughter was in highschool sova they sent educators from different states to see how we did so much with so little respect for our teachers,1
as someone whos from md and lives in pa pennsylvania came higher than i expected and maryland was lower baltimore probably dragged maryland down but pa is a surprise thats because pennsylvania schools are funded through a system called school taxes where each of the school districts spread across counties levy their own property taxes to fund their schools thats why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good this system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities or those in the poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at,0
ok here we go arizona louisiana alaska new mexico nevada oklahoma california alabama west virginia mississippi south carolina idaho montana hawaii michigan north carolina oregon georgia arkansas tennessee florida south dakota indiana north dakota texas utah wyoming washington colorado ohio kansas kentucky missouri illinois maine iowa nebraska wisconsin rhode island pennsylvania minnesota delaware maryland vermont new hampshire virginia new york connecticut new jersey massachusetts,1
just moved my family from ny to va and although ny is one level higher in education what we gained as a family with piece of mind among everything else is priceless great video briggs,2
according to wallethub the best state in the country for quality of education is massachusetts followed by california according to research released january by wallethub the study was part of wallethub s annual ranking of the most least educated states in america this year s ranking combined two categories educational attainment and quality of education broken down by relevant metrics massachusetts placed first in both categories followed by california while the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school associates undergraduate and graduate diplomas quality of education includes metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race within that category california follows massachusetts rounding out the top five for quality of education are florida maryland and vermont respectively,2
i grew up in mass and the schools were excellent that said my kids go to school in los angeles and there are some great public schools here my daughter went to a french immersion public school in glendale ca i felt like she got a pretty amazing and unique education,2
the closest i got to college was watching the professor on gilligans island that must put me a few points ahead,2
im from ca and i find this super surprising while overall our stats suck when you look at the exceptions the smart kids here astound me at dimanomd bar i knew this kid who was talking calc as a sophmore in high school i also met this taiwanese girl who was taking data structures and algorithms at and recently got into uc berkeley i think while overall our stays suck our top scholars here can top other scholars after all the uc system has some of the most prestigious universities according to us news,2
would have been nice to see what per student funding was per state as well see which states are getting a return for their dollar or correlation between and funding and results,1
nothings wrong with going to college its the fact that we are traditionally taught that we all need to go to college to be successful when in fact college isnt for everyone and especially isn t the only way to succeed in life same people that tell you to go to college are paying debt still from it how the rich stay rich and poor stay poor,0
exactly as a member of genx a lot of us are still paying off our loans but yet are gonna send our kids to do the same thing years later i think not i say this as a person with a bachelors and masters degree i encourage young people to get as much education for free or as cheaply as they can the important thing is output if you produce good work academic or otherwise youll always be in demand with the internet people are able to start all sorts of income producing ventures without high overhead you can become a software programmer using tutorials online and make plenty of money you can learn a trade with only two years of study via community college if youve got the mind to start your own company afterwards then get a business degree when youre able to pay as you go you can learn digital marketing without a degree,2
my son is a senior in high school this year he says he might choose community college but doesnt want a year university trade school is fine too i think he just doesnt know what he wants to do with his life yet and thats okay i went to college and spent years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me i dont understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they havent even had the opportunity to live life yet i want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one im in no rush to kick him out all i ask is that he works or goes to school i dont want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job i want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly i dont want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet he can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so theres no age limit,0
as a millenial i cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow how much could colleges charge and get away with how far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place now that the next gen has seen the effects they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security universities is just way too expensiveon top of that theres cost of housing and food and transportation if it were more affordable i truly believe more kids absolutely would go but if someone in that position asked me for advice i would always advise them to at least complete community college and year degrees or certification programs at the very least in a practical field many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs,0
i find this so awesome i hope these colleges are forced to significantly drop their prices they sucked american students dry crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security now its finally coming to a head and its long overdue i hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt,2
i started my career in the food industry as a shelf stocker at a grocery store then was promoted to merchandiser then to a buyer a vendor later asked me to join them doing sales fast forward to today i m still doing sales but now in the seafood industry and make about k gross annually not bad for someone that didn t go to college find what you re good at and work hard at it college isn t for everyone,2
this was inevitable university tuition kept skyrocketing over the past years tuition has greatly outpaced both inflation and incomes for collegeaged students the entire millennial generation became de facto indentured servants from their college debt basically financial slaves to their debt education can be very useful for employment goals but there are limits and we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective generation z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt trust me gen z you do not want to find yourself in that situation it will steal years if not decades from your life and you will never get that time back also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovationfocus its common for software developers to earn figure salaries with no college at all companies do not care where you went to school or even of you went they only care if you have the skills that can help solve their business problems how you go about acquiring those skills is totally irrelevant the company doesnt care if you learned to program java at college or on your own its high time that universities start to feel the sting to their annual profits as more and year olds wake up and push back on the cost of attending college,1
they are smart to opt out ive been going to school my entire life im and enjoy learning there is no difference between high school and community colleges there is also no guarantee you will find work with a degree just because you have a degree doesnt mean your work is good professors will rarely tell you if your portfolio is good because they dont care the institution they work for already have their money technical colleges used to be different but they too are falling into the hands of ceo executives who think they know how to run a college colleges also dont let teachers teach the price of education is not worth it you get a better education from the university of youtube which most teachers use to teach,1
when education becomes a business instead of a right this is what happens,0
well lets consider this most nations give free college to their citizens here in the us however we charge them to attend colleges that would make our nation more educated and more adept at highskilled jobs its almost like we want our population to suffer while we are going threw an economic crisis but hey lets ignore that completely right,0
instead of being mad cause people only know this song because of gta you should be glad todays games show great music to the new generations,2
love the lyric believe it or not there s life after high school and daryl s expression while singing it,2
my son was playing gtai was like you listen to hall and oates worlds collided that day,2
thank gta for putting some classics on the radio hits different when your cruising down the highway and this comes on,2
if you dont like hall and oates then you probably dont like music,0
when this was released in i was in high school and i loved it im here in still loving it just as much oh how i wish we could go back to the s best time ever,2
daryl hallwhat a voice,2
just another underrated ho song that absolutely kicks ass,2
believe it or not theres life after high school,2
absolute tune the ending is great feels like it needs another seconds of that guitar riffing to be honest,2
if you allow young people to be inquisitive creative and selfreliant they will educate themselves throughout their adult lives childhood should be seen as a sacred phase of development and education as a means of the individual to empower themselves as and when they choose to not a punishment to be inflicted upon the unwilling until they are ready to enter the ranks of workers bureaucrats and managers,1
is no one gonna point out that russells a way better moderator than of journalists and academics that interview him nowadays,1
russel brand did a really good job here he made the interview light and enjoyable and at the same time probed yuval to go deeper into his ideas than ive seen him go in other interviews,2
it seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to society and do good things and the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the world students need to learn the language of the world they need a good solid understanding of the basics then they can adapt to anything and be better prepared to contribute,2
oh how i love russell brand listen to him praise the students for the quality of their questions he is such a great example of raising each other up,2
you know philosophers are very very patent peoplethey can argue for thousands of years about some ethical dilemma without resolution,1
to become a selfguided learner start with platos dialogues on education how do you know what you need to know until after youve learned it how can you tell what is true these were considered crucial questions then that needed urgent answers,1
thanks for this its so relevant and i heard some excellent questions and i liked the way they were answered and how sometimes brand translated or summed up hararis answers it made things even more clear and focussed than the talks and interviews i had watched and read in the past little while the audience was fabulous and asked the best questions ever,2
great discussion thank you yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future i would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future useless people my government in africa has done nothing to help the people all it has done is line the pockets of the politicians education is already being reengineered today by the private sector udacity coursera come to mind there are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world so the future of the youth of today depends on them thomas friedman in his book thank you for being late suggests that the previous digital divide between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the motivational divide the youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated and overcome the natural laziness that yuval tells us about and learn and keep learning what they need to know is what to learn then learn it with the help of the internet organisations like udacity khan academy coursera and coaches and mentors teachers in the world of yesterday schools also need to embrace these changes,1
coming to this in isolated and away from my kids thousands of km awaymy son chose to read theology i had read law politics and economics and retain a keen interest in these areas i had discouraged his choice and questioned it i was probably wrong,0
india is a country of a billion people but if anyone ever says that stuff again ask them what is the addressable market for their product and watch the fun ill bet my money of these so called entrepreneurs dont know how big their market actually is thats why they can never convert their company into conglomerates,0
ive started company twice once when in college and again internationally i noticed that india largely emulates the us way of doing things in reality we should follow the uk model that means unit economics first and market dominance next and not vice versa,1
really value of an iit or iim is not in their curriculum its in the students who get into these institutions after beating lakhs of people,1
i dont know why people dont watch interviews they are as insightful if not more,0
you never disappoint,2
masters union cannot replace institutions like iim or iit because of the sheer fact that mu does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university indian colleges or universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an iit or iim has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into iims and iits be lacking in certain core subjects dont assume i am a casteist because i am outlining a drawback in reservation policy i completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education but in an institution like masters union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten while masters union assures great education institutions like iits and iims ensure social equity and great education the entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in mu,0
im learn a lot from this video i like how pratham is talking about insights of industry,2
hey guys you always create very valuable content thanks for that can you make a video on icreate a government institute to promote startups,2

les dejo aqu otra informaci n importante sobre las pr ximas capas,1
me parecio interesante ahora creo que habra menos fallos en votaciones e influencias como en twitter,1
me parece muy bien ya que como vimos en el video de que pasar a si bobi compra minecraft nos menciona que twitter es una de las redes sociales m s toxicas y me parece bien que nadie sea influenciado por nadie as todos podemos tener nuestro voto personal solo falta esperar a los mobs y mas jugadores para la minecraft live,1
me pregunto si los servidores aguantar n tantas personas en la votaci n,1
a mi me parece una buena din mica pero me gustar a quef lo hicieran en el sitio web para mas accesibilidad a todos los jugadores premium y no premium pd soy premium pero en el launcher oficial no me carga la y en tlauncher si carga no c porq,1
discrepo mucho con eso a pesar de que las votaciones ya no sean en twitter se puede seguir influenciando a la gente desde ah porque siempre habr gente que mire twitter para ver las opiniones de sus youtubers favoritos sobre el evento,1
me parece muy bien que lo hagan as como tu una vez le recomendaste porque as ser m s entretenido y encima m s seguro muy buen video,1
sinceramente espero que mojang nos sorprenda con mucho contenido y una optimizaci n justa para comunidad porque mojang lleva a os haciendo mal las cosas,1
me quiero hacer esta versi n de mi personaje con este estilo de pixel pero no tengo uno que este en steve alguien me dice el nombre de este pixel de minecraft,1
yo solo espero que todo lo que muestren en esta minecon lo agreguen en esa misma actualizaci n no como paso con el warden que lo pospusieron o como las luci rnagas que no las agregaron like si t est s de acuerdo,1
let s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative,2

for the last run it is possible for that portal thing it happened to me before although this is obviously cheated,1
no matter how much they cheat got to give the first guy credit for not spawning another ender eye just to fill the portal,1
one time playing minecraft l found a buried desert temple i never noticed that they existed tho so l found a cave decided to dig further in and l found the treasure room i thought it was a structure keep in mind l had never heard of desert temples and when l was looting it it randomly blew up i had no idea what it was and until l learned what a desert temple is l always dug in a cave dead end,1

first of all silvers videos are just getting better and better what a guy second tarpor is one of the best leaders weve seen in a civ event absolutely incredible video filled with so much emotion and such a phenomenal plot,2
i had a hunch that the survivors would win even with their low quality gear i knew because they had spirit determination and unity thats what makes an army strong,2
the antiscientists taking advantage of silvers joke to decieve the others was genius,1
love how the anticure scientists just gaslit their way into the survivors side i feel like we didn t really get to see how much the mutant zombies pestered the teams though i suppose that might just mean there weren t really any notable events aside from what was shown guess their fellow man was enough of an enemy already,1
i like how the scientists were the ones who doesn t believe in antidotes that s like air plane pilots being flat earthers,1
i love how realistic and interactive your challenge videos are its like survivor lol really love it looking forward to more in the future wish i could join the servers tho,2
i d e a for new civilization experiment nations are split on the big continent and a small lake isle in the center of continent the nations are plains boost to farming and gathering resources get more of them they have additional heart in ther region but they have heart in other regions so making a nation to defend rather then attack structures castle and village next to it jungle jump higher and get much lower fall damage can build special sorts of bases i guess but heart overall structures aztec temple and village on trees desert loses less hunger bars over time other nations in their region lose heart but the desert people lose heart in other regions like the plains structures a pyramid and a trading post swamp their potions are more effective and lasting they dont need to kill blazes to make potions but they have heart in their region structures giant witch hut islanders live on their own island faster swimming on boats and themselves better fishing efficiency but the isle is little and not much land is fertile that makes them invade others structures seaport dock and coastal village snow it is very cold there and people are brutal they are heart s in the beginning but for every kill they get heart that makes them an aggressive unstable society but they can eat only meat because they probably have never seen vegetables structures igloo village plus viking fort mountains quick diggers x speed structures forgotten mine dvarvish fortress the situation of the regions snow mountains plains islanders swamp jungle desert,1
this event was absolutely wild,2
yo tarpor really has showed himself as a very charismatic smart and strong leader paying tribute to him three scientists and all the other survivors remained and been killed for making this way through,2
the coolest thing surely was the diamond craftee mecha armor,2

great video as usual but i cant help but feel disappointed at how the hunters get so regularly outclassed,0
i really miss the times where you would do butcher farms and stuff and i look forward to seeing it again cuz tbh some ppl just came here because you used to do things more differently and when you stopped doing that it got just a bit more boring maybe you can do a week for a farm theme and the other week for this theme this is just a suggestion but ik ur working hard to make us happy so keep up the good work,2
i had the same idea using a skulk sensor for a secret base entrance i used it at a mountain and put it at a spot where you can get to the door in time but the pistons dont activate it nice job with yours,1
i wish the recovery compass actually pointed you to ores although finding ur dead body is still pretty useful,1
can you do more prison escapes those were fun to watch as well,2
does anyone else miss when ryan used to do escape rooms also you can find sculk sensors in chest in anchent city would probably have been faster,2
i love your builds it s cool you are a pro jj,2
i tried this it came out great my friends love it they ask were did i get the idea and i told them to survive and like and share,2
hi mikey and jj hope you have a great day i love your vidoes they are inspirational for my minecraft builds,2
you both can make it tri anything you guys got this in and mike to the and i love your videos they make my day so amazing and i love your videos because they say noob vs pro and you both are pros and the noobs are the mods you guys are the best players ever in minecraft,2
did you and mikey survive that fall at the end,1
i love your videos there sooooooooooooooooooo good,2

it was obvious that dream would never stop speedrunning i knew he would do a twist,1
i love the fact that they were chasing dream but as soon as they entered the deep dark with the warden they had a new goal entirely survive,2
i laughed so hard with the scene with the warden and i am honored that dream is wearing technoblades crown,2
the ancient city but has to be the coolest thing to happen in a manhunt and is the perfect example of why it was added,2
love how it stops being a manhunt as soon as the wardens spawn in,1
dream wearing teachnoblade s crown is just so wholesome,2
good seeing you back and thats a nice tribute its good to see humanity isnt a forgotten concept,2
insane as always great content the dynamic between everyone is unbeatable,2
you know how theres speedruns for a single player beating minecraft how interesting would it be to see a speedrun with multiple players trying to beat minecraft together,2
i just love how dream find him being able to talk on twitter more important than a child receiving lifechanging harassment edit thx for the likes,2

dein content is einfach immer so hochwertig egal was es ist probs an dich dass du immer so krass durchziehst und probs an die cutter und dieden coder der challenges,1
wahrscheinlich die mit abstand besten animation eines minecraftmobs aller zeiten insane arbeit die in diese folge gesteckt wurde und ein krankes ergebnis,1
challengeidee alle aggressiven mobs fliehen vor dir w hrend alle normalerweise friedlichen mobs dich angreifen,1
einfach kein witz komplette aufmachung die kleine story line dazu das design richtig krank w nsche dir viel erfolg f r den n chsten versuch,1
ich denke immer wie will man dass machen dass es nicht langweilig wird immer verschiedene bosse zu t ten und sich davor auszur sten aber basti schafft es jetzt schon zum xten mal respekt,1
ich liebe diese ganzen einzelnen comebacksbitte mach weiter so,2
pass auf dass er sein dark totem am ende nicht benutzt das k nnte eine starke zweite phase werden,1
perfekt geschnitten minuten sind k rzer als man denkt,1
schon allein die story ist dieses mal so geil wie gut kann ein minecraftvideo gemacht sein basti sein team ja,1
riesen kompliment an die coder ich hab noch nie sowas gesehen mit so vielen verschiedenen attacken und computergesteuert einfach genial,2
one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he always respect us the audience and his team and he is always polite in all of his videos we congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come and everything to come,2

i feel happy when i receive a notification of subscriber,2
dang i liked hearing twice the toycat but also glad they decided that having the vote on twitter where alts and people who dont have the game can vote wasnt the best idea,2
stoked to finally get a cape i missed the boat on the migration cape my ancient mojang account from ish is long lost to history but i did buy both versions on pc years ago and bought it on mobile back in or goodbye optifine cape hello official cape,1
i am excited for the prospect that like the example test vote the mob vote may last a longer period of time like hours because they usually happen at like am my time hopefully a larger section of the playerbase will end up getting to vote with the new system,2
i feel a bit ripped off by the cape i bought both versions of the game but bedrock edition on the xbox and java well on a pc i still bought both versions since windows and xbox are the exact same but i will not be getting the cape since you had to buy windows and xbox separately meaning they see them as two different items though it s the exact same version of the game just different platforms edit they are indeed the same email of course though they might hopefully surprise me and this is just a worry about nothing,2
im glad that they are doing a change to the voting system i remember last year it was a hassle to make a twitter account just to vote for the copper golem and for it to not win,1
it s a better system but if they do another mob before adding the old ones im gonna have an aneurysm,1
i liked the broken audio version better felt like we could hear inside toycat s head,2
the goal of capes is to be a reward for a thing and to be rare and there are some that are rarer than others now it s just one more cape in the wild of all the minecraft account some capes are more rare adding an account more value because you deserved it,2
i hope if theyre going to use this server for voting issues the server can handle the traffic else it will be a very laggy experience for all of us,0

hey there checkout my hour sat math crash course and use code first for a discount if you want to master the sat math section,2
i m taking my first sat exam this saturday junior here taking internationally trying to aim for at least a may luck be with all of us,2
great tips i also tell my students to chill on fridays if you train for a marathon why would you run a full marathon the day before your race same goes for your brain i also like that you mentioned learning from your mistakes the key is to make sure you go back over your practice i tell my students to not write the correct answers and go back and retry the problems they missed to see if they can get the right answer the second time around thanks for the video,2
even after practicing more than questions till now im not able to cross the barrier i have given practice tests till today and my scores are and what could be the probable reason according to you please help i really feel frustrated and hopeless now to think that even after practicing so many questions im not able to get a score edit ive given one attempt and my score was,0
how do i improve on my history passage i got a on it whereas im constantly getting close to perfect on other passages,1
i am getting close to perfect in writing and math but i am getting like anywhere between wrong in reading section constantly wiuthout any real pattern any tips,0
instead of charging money for notes just make a pateron,1
thanks ritesh these are very helpful tips,2
im taking the sat this saturday aug th and i didnt study anything wish me luck guys ill need it,2
ritesh why are you charging money for your sat notes no bro this is not the way i cant use your notes now,0
for those who have not seen already i will be hosting a free live sat reading session on lighthall this wednesday pm est register for free here,1
summary annotate read the questions first dont overprepare vocabulary all vocab questions are based on context practice active reading with this time you saved go prep for the sat ik youre going to kill it,2
hi i am a rising sophomore i have gotten a on my latest practice sat with a in english and in math will i be able to hit at least a on the real sat exam if i practice these methods everyday for the reading part of the sat,1
guys i need more tips for reading sometimes i get wrong questions and other times i get how do i remain consistent with just days left for sat,0
annotate read questions first focus,1
i really hope to get a good sat score after watching your videos,2
thank you so much can you make specific tips for esl students,2
thanks for the help ritesh been watching ur vids for months now,2
hey ritesh thanks alot you are helping so much,2
can you also give writing tips,1
make sure to check your answer sheet with someone next to you during the test,1
i saw this video several months ago and took my sat last month with ur tips i got a thank u so much,2
hi i ve been kind of in a state of stupor since the school year ended i m a rising high school sophomore and this video got me extremely motivated the sat is still relatively far in the future for me but i wanted to prepare ahead of time i will keep all your tips in mind i wanted to thank you for getting me motivated again d good luck in your studies,2
im giving the sat on the oct i loved this video gonna implement that into my schedule and i shall update this comment when i get my score,2
hey thank u for making this video im going to be in the th grade this fall and im thinking about taking the sat in th gradespring im foreign and you really motivated me to start getting ready for the exam so i succeed and fulfill my dream of attending a university in the usa,2
i got pen and paper and made a note of everything you said and pasted it on my wall this was such a good video im aiming for at least a,2
hey this a great video it gives a great overview of studying for the sat the best video ive seen your editing is awesome too i liked the fast pace anyway thanks for making this,2
were you studying for the sat while you had school if so then how much time did you study everyday for the sat compared to your school hw thank u sm xoxo,2
this is great advice i think that going over all the problems i get wrong will really help increase my act score i really like how you set your lock screen and created a schedule thankyou,2
thank you for this usually talking about the sat brings me so much stress but this calmed me down thank you,2
hey there checkout my hour sat math crash course use code first for off join my mailing list here for updates deals and more,2
thanks for sharing the study like it s your last test even though you re taking it twice is an interesting approach i get the value in it but i actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out i tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again also the focus on the math first i like i ll actually have them only do one portion of the test with me for the whole month or two and then take the test and then do the other portion for a whole month or two to superscore,2
hi ritesh im a brazilian student ive been studying for the sat like crazy for the past months my goal is a but im stuck at the ive scored a month ago on mock but only ever since and i feel it is a lot due to my mentalitystress do you recommend anything for me to relax or review so i can actually get a,0
hi ritesh verma first of all i want to say bunch of thanks for helping us with your incredible skills and knowledges i have a quatiosn for you is it possible change sat exam test date and how can we do this i found from my collage board change resigtration but i couldnt change my test date and test center,2
question is there a specific reason why you recommend taking the sat twice i heard a lot that getting a or above is a mark that for example colleges dont look too deeply into whether you got a or not too big of a deal so if i were to get a the first time should i really take it again,1
i have a sat in days and i have not prepared that much please pray for me,1
im an international student so im taking the test in december in the format is completely changing for students outside the us so would you still recommend taking the test again,1
do you suggest any specific book for doing well in this short period,1
hey man do you have any tips to avoid silly errors i get errors just due to carelessness or not reading the passage thoroughly do you have any tips for that,0
quick question i got a on a previous official sat i made some stupid math mistakes but killed the english section for the most part can i still clutch up and get that through a bunch of studying or is that a strechthis is my first sat btw,0
tomorrows my sat exam and trust me this was the best video that i have seen so far for the reading section thank you anna,2
you literally just made a super hard test seem like a fifth grade spelling test thank you,2
that tip on twopart questions is probably the best sat tip ive ever gotten thanks,2
notes all the information you ll need will be on the test whether it s in the passage or the little introduction brief before reading the passage skim the questions to see if there re any summarytheme questions and take note of the vocab words remember to read the titlelittle introduction for vocab questions read the whole sentence plus maybe the sentences before and after for context then substitute in each answer know what certain terms are for twopart questions look at the second part and highlight all the quotes in the passage then read the first question only the question and try to see which quote answers every part of the question compare the quote to the first question s answers for the literature passage try to be engagedto have fun read challenging books beforehand for the debate passages read the first passage and answer all the passage specific questions while it s still fresh in your mind repeat for passage especially for the sciencebased passages don t infer anything use the passagegraphs to back up each answer,1
the sat reading section was like torture to me i would get questions wrong all the time but with alot of hard work and dedication i ended up getting a on it you can do this guys,0
super helpful i m not exaggerating if i said this one of the most valuable videos about sat on youtube thanks a lot wish me luck for december s sat,2
u seem rly genuine and u dont give off the vibes that u just made this video to boast so thank u for that,2
im an sat tutor and this taught me a few excellent tips ive never seen or thought ofespecially those intimidating questionevidence ones impressive thx,2
this helped me get a on reading bringing my superscore to thanks,2
there are types of scorers those who tried really hard in prep do really well in school and then share people their tips and how they did it and the kid who is just really smart and did not prep and has no clue how to help people because they just chose the right answer,1
check out my free satact workshop below is the link,1
doesnt seem too bad until you have to do it by yourself haha,1
this is the most helpful walkthrough everybody else just talks fast lol,2
ive actually taken this exact practice test so this walkthrough really showed me what i did wrong and explained some concepts i realize i didnt understand completely i found it very helpful thank you so much,2

i love that you re going fast and at an accurate speed for the real exam love your techniques so much thank you please keep these coming,2
here in india even th class exam comes harder than this,0
straight forward with no bs thank you this is so much better than any professional help,2
ive been studying on khan academy for a couple of weeks now using their sat practice problems watching you do this has helped me so much more than that has thus far thanks,2
ive taken the sat times the most frustrating part about the sat is that unless youre at an advanced level in math or above the normal level for your grade theres a high chance you wont understand or even recognize over of the material and questions the first time i took it i barely understood a lot of the math on it because i wasnt even completely through algebra long story short i hate standardized testing and i feel as though a lot of kids are set up for failure tt im lucky i got to take it multiple times this year since i understand most of the math now,0
im going to take the test in five days and i just found out this video thanks for sharing,2
hi could you please recommend which type of calculator should we use for the sat,1
really informative thank you,2

i wanted at least a that was my goal my minimum i got an now i m retaking it senior year but i m completely dejected i have a couple weeks left i m really trying to understand things better people are counting on me,0
this is so helpful i m also trying to raise my original score around points to get in the s range and seeing that you were able too helps me see that it s possible,2
let me tell you my story first time i took my psat when i was in freshmen year and i got a i took it again in sophomore year and i got i took the psat again in junior year and i got i ve been self studying past months and i think i can get,2
how long did overall raising your score by points take you how many hours did you spend per week any tips on how to balance school extracurriculars and studying for the sat,1
my tip if you know you re taking the act study for that first the timing of the act is much faster so if you study hard and get used to it the sat will seem like a piece of cake at least that s how it was for me,2
honestly for me at least knowing that there will be another opportunity really relieved my test anxiety and i ended up with a much better score than i predicted,2
that s so funny we got the exact same first two sat scores and hoping that s a good sign and through hard work and dedication there will be a in my future,2
i took it at the end of my sophomore year and got a just took it again months into junior year and got a my superscore is a combining my tests hoping this video helps me reach the i want by the end of my junior year,2
thank you so much i m currently studying for the sat as well and i really recommend the college panda books including erika meltzer s critical reading for the reading section,2

totally not trying to cram everything in one night good luck on everyone else who s taking it tomorrow small update the test wasn t so bad i think overall it s the stress we put on ourselves just be sure to read everything carefully and not to second guess too much if a question is hard skip it and come back later get the points you know you for certain understand and can get and then the rest,2
god bless this man im a college drop out whos trying his best to go back to school and get his education degree but never took the sat while i was in high school btw hoping i can pull thru and prove myself as a capable individual,2
i have my sat next week and i think this was the most useful minutes of my entire quarantine thank you,2

rensselaer polytechnic is such a gem of a school its a shame it wasnt even mentioned on this list after graduating my oldest went to microsoft and my second went to amazon both for software engineers my third has his foot in the door for jnj for chem eng they were average kids that got an incredible education as proven by their technical interviews i think you really need to mention rpi in more of your videos,2
i ve been watching since freshmen year heading into my senior year now i self studied with many tips from here and got a today thank you,2
thanks for sharing i am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to since sat scores are all relative since i score a it blows my mind to think about being in the top i think the part about scores being inflated because schools dont have to report bad test scores since students arent submitting bad tests scores makes sense however i do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the us world news report requires a school to report at least of its students scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings thus more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots,2
hi brooke ive been watching your videos for a while and was able to score a as a junior my subscores are both which is causing me a dilemma because i want to go into engineeringcs my total score is at the th percentile or higher for almost every school im applying to but my math is at the lower end for my intended major some places should i retake to get a or or will it not make much difference,1
hey brooke would a superscored sat made from a m e and a m e be looked down upon by schools that have right at the bottom of the middle would raw be a considerable improvement,1
hi i m an international student do you think i have to take sat and submit my test scores how important is that for a class of especially if i want to get into a good university,1
hi brooke great video as always quick question do you think the sat will serve of any relevance for students of the class of and beyond regards,2
what if you have a big divide my daughter has a math score under but a verbal score over for a she also has an unweighted in ap and ib courses s on both ap tests she took so far and a on her first ib test,1
whats the reasoning behind not going test optional if you score in the th percentile wouldnt it make more sense to submit only if youre in the median score range,1

skim through the questions actually read the passage carefully once first kind of question main theme save for last second kind vocab seeing the words that you do know and use the process of elimination third kind paired questions pair the choices from the questions remember that these types questions are meant to have a single answer underline main subject and main verb semicolons and periods are generally interchangeable and colon sometimes too read through the whole paragraph before they ask you to change the structure of the paragraph,1
i m actually kinda nervous cause i m taking my sat tomorrow and did no studying whatsoever watching this give me some confidence thx,0
not me watching this hours before i take the test,0
i got a with little preparation everyone here will be fine even if you don t get the score you want life goes on,2
read questions first read the passage carefully save the main theme questions for last ask myself if the word i do know could be the answer take advantages of the pairs choose the best answer theres only one,1
i received a score of though it s only a part of what the colleges are looking for in my case my high school grades steadily improved throughout the years with my junior year ending in around gpa and gpa for my senior year i was accepted into uc schools pennstate and a guaranteed transfer to boston university,2
to be honest about this whole thing youre right you dont have to study the knowledge you accumulated from th to th grade all you have to know are the tricks wealthy people pay just for this to the test and thats the only way possible to get a high score its like a very special system to weed out the people who cant afford to go to college i feel sorry for this because education should be affordable to all,0
retaking it tomorrow got a last time so let s hope it goes well this time edit i got a,2
read questions first actually read the passage main theme question for last keep unknown word in mind link up the line evidence and best understood questions take advantage of the pairs choose the best answer there is only one writing underline main subject single or compound and main verb in sentence if either answer is interchangeable neither is the answer semi colons and periods and colons sometimes read through the whole paragraph before you answer question,1
the guy who invented sats sounds like the type of kid to remind the teacher about the homework,0
i m surprised they didn t mention how you have to pay to take the test seriously it s one of the most obvious ways of why and how it measures family income over actual intelligence rich people can just take the test more,0
so you re telling me if this person didn t had this weird fascination of ranging peoples intelligence into some kind of scalemeter format that i wouldn t have to stress over sats so much,0
the sat is still way easier than most other countrys entrance exams,2
half the comments on this video are lol you guys think the sat is hard wait til you learn about insert random country s standardized test the discussion surrounding this video shouldn t be mine is harder and therefore better it should be about how bad standardized testing is and how it really isn t a measure of intelligence just of taking the test,0
all these people commenting im poor and i got a by studying a lot we are talking about that poor people on average are less likely to get a great score not that its impossible there is a difference between inequality in general and a specific success story,0
low scores should never be a veto on a student s life that hit me hard,0
sat exists chinese and korean entrance exams please allow me to introduce myself,1
first thing i learned after spending on my act prep was that the act measures how good you are at taking the testa test under a time constraint even people who get or dont actually know the answer they just know what for sure is not the answer my tutor,1
when i was in high school i took all general courses and got a on the act average i am now in medical school at the th percentile of my class all of which were honorap students with act scores and straight as in high school national testing doesnt look at one of the most important factors in people determination and resilience,1
full algebra playlist hope this helps with your review,2
i pray for all of those who take sat to get a very good mark and everyone succeeds and goes to a good university,2
years of maths within hour omg thank you,2
before i get into my comment i would like to say thank you i really appreciate that fact that you take the time out of your own day making these incredible useful tiktok s and youtube videos so people can study even though your not making anything off of it back to the point id like to say thank you because right now i m a freshman and i didn t really have a motivation to study for the act but when i was scrolling through tik tok i saw a video with a really hard math problem but you made it seem really easy like i could do it in a minute so after that i did more research and found out how important the act really is so i ve been studying with your youtube and tiktok videos along with other things on the side i still have years before i have to take it but your videos are so entertaining they make me want to learn and get better at math,2
im watching this the night before my satwe love procrastination,2
i improved by points on my sat and this was a big part of it thank you so much for making this video we all appreciate it and you,2
you cant imagine the magnitude of my gratitude towards you thanks man,2
i lowkey just started crying out of appreciation for u and all u do for us,2
this is the some of the best math help i ve ever found for the sat,2
as junior year is stressful as it already is my man i want to thank you so much for helping me out i feel confident about the sat now,2
use code first for a limited discount off my sat course,1
biggest tip of your life do lots and lots and lots of khan academy to the point where you have done so many questions that there aren t new ones edit also take practice sats every week or so,1
im worried i cant do my sat on august tt any further more techniques please,0
i am at on both math and verbal so how could i improve marks,1
the biggest problem for me right now is that i m working during the day i try to study from am but then i have to catch the bus to go to work at and then i work until but get home at then i have to walk my dogeat dinner and can only start studying at again but i wake up at so it s so hard to find time,0
the august sat was sold out in my area so i signed up for the october one instead,1
please how many hours do you spend in reading like for a day please reply this it s quite urgent thank you,1
what type of universities can i get into with a sat score and gpa keeping in mind my extracurriculars sops lors etc are pretty average,1
so excited that i graduated high school and i get to take the sat again because i want to transfer,2
how can i get fee waiver for sat exam i complete class in but not joined any college please say how can i get fee waiver,0
a girl in my school just got accepted into yale with a full ride scholarship she deserves it and im so proud of her,2
yeah the sat is unnecessary everyone proceeds to get s,0
wow glad to see that yale students are so humble and friendly,2
i just graduated from law school and attended washington u in st louis for my undergrad it is so interesting seeing all of these people a few years behind me talk about stats scores and extracurriculars yale and other elite schools can really and truly set you up for life but just remember if your scores aren t this amazing or you don t get into your dream school you still have a wonderful life ahead of you i ve taken classes at community college public universities and private universities and your education really is what you make of it college is only a few years out of the rest of your life and i wish in high school i had known that and spent more time making memories and less time worried about my gpa just my two cents and amazing that all of these students are so accomplished at such young ages,2
hey queen girl you have done it again constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly i d say i m surprised but i know who you are i ve seen it up close and personal girl you make me so proud,2
as an ib student the person who was predicted to get a thats actually insanely impressive i would say much more so than the gpas thats a which means top marks on every exam but one plus top marks on other things like essays core to the program,2
as fun as these videos are i do want to give a certain amount of warning to hs students just because you have the grades scores letters of rec essays and extracurriculars doesn t mean you ll be accepted into these schools i was denied to all of my colleges despite having a a and being on a nationally recognised robotics and rocketry team i even did robotics research in hs at a university applied to the university and then was denied from that university so much of it is just an arbitrary lottery it s hard to truly know,0
and having a ib predicted score is way more impressive than getting a gpa we have a monster on our hands,2
this is unknown territory for me its fascinating i dropped out of high school in th grade due to multiple reasons but mostly due to feeling overwhelmed and lost without any guidance im proud of these kids cause they dont all come from privilege they worked hard,2
i like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education in highscool i was a gpa student barely putting the effort to muster a c my only way getting into college was soccer but eventually i quit due to mental health i was really depressed and didn t have any motivation for anything had no friends no job and overall i was in a bad state in hs i just turned now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer but yeah would ve wished i had better guidance and wished i could go back and change that so i wouldn t have made it harder on myself i didn t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life starting to change now how i am now and it s honestly making me a better person and happier seeing you guys so happy at yale is motivation and brings me joy you guys are very smart and i also admire your hard work you put in and the sacrifice,0
this was highly requested feel free to leave questions in the comments below introductionmy scores whowhatwhenwherewhyhow sat test portion study plan books resources sat subject tests and psat,1
super useful i wish i had this when i was doing sats,2
i got a score of when i took the practise test offered by khan academy with a on maths and on english in my defense it was my first attempt and i wasnt really expecting it to be this long i found your video helpfull and hope you make more sat related content,2
this was so informative im in icse board and in th grade and i know that might sound a little early to start doing all of this but frankly ive been freaking out about my entire future a lot lets just not get into that and your video helped assuage some of my worries thanks so much,2
hey avanti it would be really great to see you solving the commonly asked questions,2
im not taking the sats but still sat through the entire thing im a masters student stuck in india waiting to get back to the us it just feels good to watch your videos as weird as it may sound your videos are helping me stay hopeful,2
thank you so much for this video it was so informative and really helped someone like me who isn t be familiar with these type of exams could you also make a video about essays and how to write an impactful one to get into harvard,2
update idk if all indian schools are doing this but cbse has introduced cct critical and creative thinking where all subject teachers give students cct based on the subject this also comes in boards for me only one teacher is constantly giving us work meanwhile other teachers arent very consistent so theres a website where you can access cct questions on all subjects so you can train yourself,1
hey avanti you re really helpful to a lot of people including me thanks,2
update sat subject tests have been discontinued forever sat optional essay section has been removed as well,0

i saw my friend finish reading section in like minutes and was chilling during the test and he ended up with,1
honestly getting all the questions right is a quite impressive but getting all of them wrong is wayyy more impressive,2
jehovah i pray that everyone watching this very helpful vid scores a on the upcoming sat amen,2
i got a on my sat using strategies similar to the ones you recommend so this guy is legit y all if you get anything out of this it s to take the time to fully understand the passage the only caution i d have with your strategies is to avoid any sort of generalizing as you did with finding the word that fits in context while that is the case most of the time i ve seen collegeboard switch it up before they re rude like that you re killing it tho keep up the good content,2
him answering questions in minutes me still on question after minutes,1
bro you are actually a god i just took the sat today and it went so well the only thing i did from my previous attempt in august is try using your strategy and my performance magically improved i swear i ve spent so much time trying to improve i practiced over questions read prep books and studied under tutoring yet my score decreased every attempt through the past year however you were the only one who was able to help me only other channel is supertutor tv also this happened to be the last sat i could ever take since i m a senior just wanted to say thank you so much,2
i answered questions in minute i got all of them wrong though,1
you re honestly the best sat resource that i ve seen in a while like i have learned so much from just these couple of videos compared to watching sat tips from other bigger channels thank you for all the help and i really love your style of videos ps you re gonna blow up soon i just know it cuz these videos are actually really informative,2
ive got my test tomorrow thank you so much you know one of those times when the teachers teach you stuff but then your friend just explains it briefly and easily and you understand just better than the hour looong session thats exactly how i felt anyways thanks again and wish me luck,2
bro you didnt even just get a you got every single question right thats crazy,2
whos taking it tomorrow lesss get it btw anna youre a great human being,2
im taking my sat in a week and i watched all ur vids in one sitting thank u so much for this i appreciate you,2
im just gonna be real with you if a question says delete the underlined portion as one of the choices times deleting is the best option i never see them put that choice but it doesnt fit,0
thank you so much you are helping thousands of people by uploading advice on how to be a smart test taker and using common sense to your advantage the main thing about the sat is staying calm and knowing what to do you are helping a lot with both of those,2
i am giving the sats this saturday and when i say this i mean it this is by far the best video i have watched on the reading section the double trick worked so perfectly for me in the practice test may god bless you,2
i watched all the videos in your playlist theyre very helpful you are one of those very few people that actually show something useful rather than bragging thank you,2
i ve watched so many videos on sat studying tips but none have actually gone into detail usually just recommending sites to use all your videos have seriously helped thank you so much,2
if youre taking the sat soon good luck,2
my physics teacher last year made every answer on our test c,1
imagine having the test with the fifth possibility e none of the above,1
you know the school system is bad when people are posting how to guess the answer to a question,0
whats a b ok it has got to be a whats a b easy its a whats a b i have picked a times now i think its b,1
me circles d three times in a row also me sweats nervously nah bro they gotta be trickin me,1
plot twist hes filming this in class and the teacher is waiting for him to finish before sending him to detention,1
primary definitions are almost always wrong me nods and chooses the answer that says blend means to quietly assert,0
i couldn t do this i d get anxiety and triple check the passage,0
definitely a good sign that these tests are worth the paper they re printed on when people are more focused on minmaxing time spent per question without even reading the passage as opposed to engaging with the content as it would ve been covered in class way to go college board,2
learn more in less time through my hour sat math course for a perfect score use code first for a serious discount,2
life if you re gonna get that,1
good luck on your sats for those of you that are nervous just remember that once you get into college this test will not matter anymore so dont treat it as life defining or anything,1
now this is a real sat guide all of the points you made are very realistic and factual im taking mine in october and i was afraid the way i was studying was wrong but you confirmed to me that i was studying right thank you so much,2
i love good sat scores im gonna get that score i got this you guys got this lets gooooo,2
august sat would be my first attempt and hoping to give my best,2
i hope everyone taking the august sat gets their target score,1
i love good sat scores im sure i can still do a lot in these final two weeks thank you for this video,2
like literally youve made me improve my confidence in aceing this test,2
i love great sat scores hoping for a thanks for the video,2
i did extremely well on the sat i went to a great college where i met my current lovely wife soon i reached my phd in physics i got a job as a professor at harvard university and at around years and of age i had my first child a gorgeous baby girl later on i earned my most prized achievement the nobel prize for figuring out how to manifest the theoretical push of gravity into an accessible fuel source boy how i love sims,2
i got a on my sats i went to a community college got my associates transferred to a year college did super well there went to school of medicine at uw and im almost done with my residency,2
how the hell you get out and end up working at buzzfeed,0
these people all got better scores than me i think the sat shows how well you can take a testnot how well you understand the subject im a terrible test taker,0
no talking during the exam you all failed,0
dont stress about it you have the pressure of scoring in the th percentile and not doing the worst out of all your friends your family is counting on you to get a scholarship and go to a top school its highly competitive youre competing not only with kids in your state but students in all states and this is basically the test of your lifeother than the grad school exams mcatthat determines community college or top university and the difference towards getting more money towards your pay check sure dont stress about it,1
this is the entire problem with the sat system its not about the knowledge its the tricks in taking the exam things like sat prepping and all other things should not be encourage when taking it in real statistics term the results you get from taking the test are false because youve practice to jacked up your score,0
they got high scores i got a and i thought i did good,2
no way these sat scores were accurate out of yea okay someone doesnt know how the scoring works,0
first of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements sat study classes etc obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities sat act gpa school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library that is me and i can affirm that for many asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to ivy league schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us we push for the best because of our work ethic not because all asians have oh so much money for the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities it is not that asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say mexicans africanamericans indians and other disprivileged minorities in the states the only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end i am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but i am just making a point here why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage note i put that in quotations meaning i myself do not think that is a fact there are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public so tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another can we not just all be equal human beings it is like saying red is better than pink why oh because it is true without an explanation so what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a th grade chinese girl and i wanted to share the truth to everyone thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this no enmities i hope,2
can we just appreciate my guy sitting there for hours and making this video thanks a lot for the help man,2
just think abt itwe were just freshman not worrying abt this test,1

thank you for all your advice tomorrow is my big day so fingers crossed,2
perfect timing i was just about to look for some last minute tips for my test tomorrow,2
my predictions readingwriting math i ve never done too great i ll update later alright post test predictions i truly have no idea i was so hopped up on adrenaline the whole time that i could have gotten anything right or wrong and i hardly remember time for the waiting game isuppose,1
my predictions readingwriting math overall edit after taking it readingwriting math overall my results readingwriting math overall im just going to keep this score i have been studying for over a year now and it s not going to improve,0
my prediction math reading goal,1
i m having sat today and it s am right now i am so excited yet nervous,2

my prediction math i will miss question because i either miscounted squares on a graph or multiplied numbers wrong reading writing i will do something stupid overall,0
preach race doesnt determine scores it all depends on your work ethic motivation and positive influences on your life,2
her if you have a month left you can study for like hrs everyday me uh my sats are literally in less than days,1
the sat black book really helped me i got a without studying the first time then i got a the next time after studying i m aiming for,2
im a junior whos trying to get a on the sat this year i took it last year and got a i have to study like hell,0
you got a on your very first try that s crazy,2
i didn t even know what the sat was until sophomore year because my parents didn t know much about how the school system worked here and i m the oldest so it s all firsts,0
watching this as a senior is too late lol please don t procrastinate like i did study a lot,0
title how i got a on the sat and how you can too me bet,1
hey you if youre reading this and youre about to take the sat i just wanna say youre gonna do great if you want more motivation if you wanna be hyped up a lil more keep reading while i was studying for my sats i kept telling myself this is the only thing thats academically important to do that is secluded from school meaning that there are no teachers or classmates to hinderinterrupt your learning this test is the amount of effort you put in so thats just really something to think about while youre going into this test i wish you all the best,2
idk if everyone has access to khan academy but that helps too and provides practice,2
can we get a video on how a company that sucks so much money out of students is supposed to be nonprofit,0
so mistakes in math takes you down to the things people do for money,0
so i took the sat practice test right i usually score on a practice test i make a total of mistakes on the math section on a bad day which is what happend usually it will translate to a score of i did pretty well on reading and writing sections im excited to calculate my score and then i see the horrific truth in writing is translated to points deducted for wrong answers is translated to fine is translated to points deducted for wrong answers a total of even though i did exteramly good in the writing section just above averge in reading which is a totally flawed section but thats another topic and amazing in the math section i got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school am i a joke to you,2
thank you for your video could you arrange a video for the international students application for scholarships where are the official dependable web sites the requirements everythings,2
i like how most people are trying to dislike this video,1
i remember a few years back i got a single question wrong on the psat reading section and it dropped me three points out of the possible explain to me how its not curved,0
can there also be a video about sat subject test scoring,1
the sat is curved unless the math section has been changed since i took my exams in so i really wonder what has changed since that amazing time,1
can you please do a video on how the math section on the sat is scored,1
the fact that they don t score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video what do u call saying that one test is harder than another so they can get more wrong even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating this is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar and even though this may be harder for the english section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a curve because there is no other word for what ur doing,0
want to read these tips instead of watch check out the blog for this video,1
come up with a pacing strategy review previous tests rework old mistakes review concepts youre always struggle with,1
who s reading this the day before their test,1
everyone reading this message for september th lets get those scores update it worked i got a,2

if you re taking the sat on may th i wish you the best of luck you got this,2

hello brooke we have loved all your videos and found them very helpful i was trying to look about pricing to see if you review essays my daughter has already taking her sats but we are wanting some advice on which is the best essay to submit and to review the content is this something you or your other staff do please let me know thank you,2
taking mine after tomorrow havent even prepared adequately for it this is when i want to start studying,0
that last tip was clutch i was pretty confused on how to do that one,1
very informative,2
school told us this was happening the week before the test i have roughly hours until i take it cheers,2
i did better on the sat i didn t study for,2
i offer my prayers and condolences to every child whose parents showed them this,0
that dad is so peak indian dad energy yes you achieved the perfect score but you still could have done better,2
honestly really proud of this guy hope he thrives to do more extraordinary things,2
it s every indianasian parents worst nightmare for their kid to get a score physically impossible to improve or get better on lol,0
dude didnt even care much to study and still got a perfect score hes a natural genius,2
son perfect score on sat indian dad starts with a complaint of him not getting up early understandable,1
it s always great to see lil kids doing well for themselves that s actually really cool,2
this is a once in a lifetime achievement one that he will probably never repeat there is no need for him to do it again we all know trying to achieve top marks is hard enough but when you are constantly pressured to do so it is definitely mentally taxing,1
holy smokes his dad was so critical throughout the whole thing,2
hope that dude gets into the college he wants his parents should be so proud,2
practice makes perfect good luck to everyone who is trying to take the sat and thanks bro,2

these people are not high school students they have forgotten some stuff even then the average is a lot higher than the national average of as you have claimed this is more than standard deviation from the mean and almost standard deviations i would think this concludes that chinese people are on average good in sat maths instead of looking at a fixed cutoff score of and concluding that they are not that good,0

money goneeverybody s story has switched upthe parents are guilty as hellkids traveling and gone for days with grown folkmoney fame sex lies it s a damn farce,0
parents pimping their kids and thats pure evil and they dont care why aint they being held accountable,0
if you going to charge r kelly make sure you charge the parents too,1
all need to be on trail parents pimped out their kids they re all guilty,0
if r kelly goes to jail all the parents of these young ladies need to go too,0
sad but no judgement was he wrong hell yeah but without the enablers he wouldve never gotten away with this everybody was wrong,0
why didn t they act like this years ago now all of a sudden they mad smh this trial is full of hypocrisy,0
the parents need to go to jail for allowing their daughters to be allowed to be with r kelly,0
whats done in the dark comes to the light all i can say is if there are some women using these types of schemes to just get a bag please do better because theyre actual victims out here of rape or molestation,0

just a little note for those who are frustrated and are unable to improve your sat score it is not the end of the world my sat score was but i focuses a lot of my supplements and other parts of my application and i was able to get into my top choice school nyu so don t lose hope and give it your all,2
this freaking girl got a on her freakin psat with no prior practice like wtf i can dream to get that score,0
to the highschoolers who are prepping and studying for the sat study hard and try your best don t beat yourself up if you dont end up getting a perfect or high score im a third year in college and i wish i could go back in time to tell myself the same advice,1
i dont even have an idea how exactly that sat thingy works but congratulations jasmine im happy for you and im also pretty sure hese tips will be helpful for other tests too,2
i see a lot of people worried about the sat in the comments and first of all congrats on your score jasmin that is an incredible achievement however i just want others to know that the sat and college admission isnt all in life so dont stress much about please i know someone that got a and he went to uc santa barbara its more important to worry about your being and your mental health the sat made me lose one of my best friends after he went insane trying to get a perfect score sometimes being smart just doesnt come naturally but its not all that there is to life if you read all the way thank you and remember selfcare is key,1
wait you got a without any preparations people cant even get that scores after so many practices,0
i feel like a big part of the sat is to be a good test taker there are plenty of very smart people who are not good test takers the sat just does not measure you college readiness well in my opinion,0
good luck with college apps,2
i got a on my first practice test then a after two weeks of studying and two weeks after that ive still got a baaad feeling about the real thing tho,1
as a junior almost halfway through my year im quite surprised that i never thought hard about taking this test i never focused on what i need or when i will this really makes me realize how its a new complete thing to work hard on and im scared but thankful to see this video,2
her in my diagnostic tests i was consistently getting around a me with my on the psat,1
ive been tutoring the sat for years this version of the test is the fourth version i have taught im very happy with this videos emphasis on quality studying over cramming and using actual sat questions the stressing of analyzing your wrong answers to see how you could get a question similar to it correct in the future is exactly how to go about it i have an important side note the fact that a student needs to do all this prep just because the test is a mass of eccentricities is one of many indicators of just how bogus the sat really is,2
love this taking mine aug so definitely came at the right time,2
i m currently using the sat prep black book and it has helped me a lot i never would have gotten one if it weren t for your recommendation thank you,2

thank you for the info im a brazilian student struggling if its worth applying to the us i did a indepth research some mock sat s at home and have a strong sympathy for certain american colleges education structure as compared to brazilian or european universities which im fortunate to have the citizenship in both places nevertheless if i do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years i d have to eliminate one of my options whether usp in brazil or epfl in switzerland due to the amount of time set into both while balancing my studies for the local admissions testfuvestusp the epfl s entrance exams in french and a few ec s i obtained a couple of scores at home following all the procedures as timemonitored tests i judge my english as nearfluent since i have been taking classes since i was above all i have a strong passion for physics mathematics and technologiesmainly ai related to physics research i also would be prone to take sat ii and possibly ap exams as well as the toefl to sum up with my out of gpa my main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest math or physics with computer science i have participated weekly in two educational nfos since i was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work some calls and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher which i loved i had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until i started piano lessons one year ago i have been taking english and french private lessons for years and played varsity statelevel soccer being the captain until the pandemic started i acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live i life i wont regret however i awfully believe that my extracurriculars arent good enough for top schools and im inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education but entirely different from what ive expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that i also have in history and art back to my financial means im entirely grateful for the opportunities that i already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of per year from my parents by converting my mother s income to usd we would qualify for financial support from needbased universities and those would be my goals my question is am i a strong applicant for america s a universities undergrad or have i lost my chance by not investing in a passion project,2
i missed you se eun,1

my sat is literally in a week and i cant thank you more,2
this was a great video i wish there were time stamps so i made them subjectverb agreements verb tenses pronouns antecedents adjectives adverbs modifications parallelism comparison sentence structure punctuation,2
i srsly needed something like this that summarizes everything i need to know in one place and helps me get an idea of what i need to focus on it is also great for a quick revision if u have ur exam soon,2
i can not thank you enough after watching this video it has boosted my sat reading and writing by over points,2
wow best sat grammar video ive ever watched all these things mentioned in the video have indeed helped me a lot for the sat writing section keep it up bro,2
as a brazilian i must thank you for this wonderful job you have done in portuguese im a really good writer but when comes to english i just cant keep the quality my very first time taking the sat i get wrong in the writing section however at khan academy in the last practice test that i take im getting rights with frequency which makes me really happy after that video i finally understood some keys concepts such as semicolons which im sure can give me more rights im going to take my second and last sat on this saturday so im studying hard to do well and get some financial aid thanks teacher sure you had been helping a lot of teenagers and now im one of them thanks,2
great video under one hour you re able to present and elaborate most important grammar rules that s needed in sat thanks you,2
thank you very much it really helps a lot hope you will continue doing such great videos,2
well i haven t chosen c in a while is the ultimate guessing trick,1
me watching at years old ah yes my next sat stands no chance,1
teacher don t worry guys the test is super easy that s because you already know all the answers,2
i just go with what letter would look good with this question works like a charm,2
i appreciate the assumption that the guesser is going to be slighly off and not frantically looking for the number thats closest to whatever outlandish number they got to,1
my ex is a teacher and while we were together she was creating a multiplechoice practice test for her class before their gcses but the trick was that she designed the test so that every answer was c and laughed at the thought of her students panicking over getting option c for everything,1
thats a pretty cool trick too bad we never have multiple choice questions like that,2
not entirely related to this sort of guessing but i feel like whenever all of the above is a choice on a test that it s correct about of the time,1
me a canadian high school student the sats dont stand a chance now,0
i would have reasoned to option d being that e can be written as x one might imagine that e was spawned through the miscalculation of the square root of component,1
subscribe you could be in a video d,2

i really haven t wondered how bubblegum was made but now i m glad i do know how it s made,2
im a millwright and i can tell you the difference between handmade and machine made is automation when they are making the forks throughout the process the workers using the presses and grinders are still manipulating the forks by hand also the mms and gum are good examples of automated processes,1
i hope you guys like the new video concept,2

they are geniuses all the team of mr beast i admire them very much let the successes continue guys,2
why is no one talking about how motivated chandler was to not have his search history shown bro clearly had something to hide,0
truly inspiring video the presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game i love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most minecraft videos being published today using pc or console versions of the game and i really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles i really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding if you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter this means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem in the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety i also appreciate the chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication it also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles the background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come a really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls i cant wait to see more work from you simply phenomenal,2
chandlers face at the end was priceless,2
one of the best thing about this dude is that he never takes creadat for him self when he achieve something he allows respect us,2
the people that make these maps are legends,2
subscribe or i kick you,0

mr beast eats edible gold me eats a ferrero rocher wrapper,1
the food doesnt look that amazing its basically just a normal meal wrapped in gold i say as i shove another pizza roll in my mouth,0
all those looked delicious and seeing their reactions tells me id love it if i had it,2
its scary how much gold jimmy must have in his veins,0
mr beast eats pizza me thinks pizza hut is expensive,0
man watching them eating cheap to expensive foods make me feel so hungry right now including that golden pizza,1
watching him eat the grilled cheese and the golden pizza makes me drool,2
i would do anything for even just a slice of that pizza,2
i m a teacher and would be honored to use that pen to pass fail my students,2
chris s energy is just awesome,2
chris issuspiciously happy when he thought it was a fursuit,2
happy birthday jimmy i hope you keep helping more and more people and officially make this world a better place,2
i just love chris is just going really fast and jimmy is have a good time lol,2
you can tell chris is becoming more of a dad by the oh it s a box joke,1
jimmy just straight up had fun while chris was racing air,2
bro his face when riding in the go kart is so wholesome you could tell he was genuinely enjoying that,2
are they more chaotic than usual or is it just me love your videos btw,2
so much fun to watch,2
chandler fails nd grade also chandler wins an island,1
i love how garett perfectly represents that one kid who won t shut up about something that they think makes them cool,2
imagine how embarrassing it must be for the teachers,0
imagine how far chandler wouldve gotten if he didnt get wrong on purpose in nd grade,1
i wonder how far karl and nolan would go if they were around at the time,1
teacher i wrote the answers for the test on the board chandler fails somehow,0
can we all collectively agree mr beast is the best content creator,2
legend says chandler still can t pass nd grade,0
the teachers are probably feeling humiliated teaching adults especially the one who taught chandler nd grade and he failed xd,0
we gathered a list of the most talented people we could find on the internet and held our own talent show for a prize,2
its so fun to watch people whose talents are this impressive but its even more fun to watch jimmy and chris narrating together,2
i am so happy for lars anderson bow guy that man is truly talented and dedicated to his craft he also shot three arrows in seconds which is unbelievable,2
bow guy is actually from denmark and as a dane i am proud that he had the talent to impress jimmy and chris,2
it s so cool to just see how dedicated people are to a single talent,2
chris and jimmy have such a good energy together,2
chris is so funny and truly the meme lord,2
i love watching chris and mr beast react together and i love watching satisfying videos but the thing is we watched chris eat more chicken nuggies than the satisfying videos,2
now we know jimmy and chris are just buds watching a guy lay bricks,1
when chris eats each nugget i want to eat nuggets,1
jimmy should have done this challenge before starving himself for days lmao,0
i love how jimmy says you and chris didnt catch it,2
i love how jimmy said hydrolic with the letter o but chris didnt catch on and give him a nugget,2
as a fellow serb my self this made me happy and idk why,2
i love how jimmy didn t catch him saying watermelon on a grinders cool cool cool cool let s watch it go into the void void void void,2

let s all appreciate that this man never disappoints with his family friendly videos,2
making this for jimmy was worth it he gives to people and deserves everything that comes his way,2

i remember watching your hour modern warfare stream you inspired me to build my first pc when i was when i watched your first build video with your dad so proud of where you re at man you re doing amazing,2
lets appreciate how much work preston puts into these vids,2
legendary video as usual,2
it annoys me that people try to cancel this man he s been doing stuff that even some governments don t bother to do,0
as a high school math teacher in texas this is awesome you dont realize how much the teachers spend on school supplies for their own classrooms because our kiddos dont have the supplies they need we dont want any student to be without,2
the things this man has done for the world is incredible he totally deserves his success,2
jimmy is such a kindhearted person finally someone that has money doing something good with it,2
my wife is a teacher and she greatly appreciates everything you all do for school systems they really do impact our future,2
this is genuinely one of the most loving things ive ever seen that was just righteous,2
this channel brings happy tears to my eyes keep up the fantastic work,2
absolutely loved this video glad he got the teachers on it as well bc most classrooms are fully teacher funded bc the school only gives them for classroom supplies and that is nowhere near enough for an entire school year teachers deserve the world,2
this had me with the biggest smile the whole video the kids the corny jokes the awkwardness i loved it,2
subscribe to me and i ll build you a surprise beemteam,2
dude this video felt so well done ur vids are getting better and better every time great work beem team,2

i just found your channel a few days ago and i have been obsessed i love seeing the crazy things you do and build,2
matthew content always be amazing i like the way everyone works together to make the projects happened i been subscribed to him channel for a long time now thanks matthew and friends for bringing us real good content,2
great effort matthew you never cease to amaze me with your ideas always seeming too top the previous,2
mathew spends all this time building a play button for jimmy jimmy tips it over,1
id like to see a panel of security experts govt officials intimately familiar with standards for handling tssci such as the ics and the like anyone who has held a cleared position in dod is familiar with the mandatory security training they had to take every year and probably remembers the many references to the dodm ics and other standards i think the public needs to hear first hand officially how this material was supposed to be taken care of they need to hear about scifs combo safes cypher locks cover sheets security procedures and all the penalties associated with mishandling such material this is not a political discussion its a national security matter,1
when you have a two three four tier justice system things like this happen and criminals run rampant,0
i can tell you why trump filed it with this judge in particular he thinks every judge he appointed owes him for that and will overlook their oath to help him out if this judge says no he will call her a rino and appeal it with another judge as for why now he is hoping he can stall the investigation,0
i love the judges why did you come to me because trump appointed you and trump expects loyalty and bias in his favor,2
he needed the documents because deutsche bank doesnt believe hes as rich as he says he is they flat out refused to take eric as collateral,0
it would be a political decision not to charge trump for taking the classified documents and refusing to surrender them,1
he s had them for months there s no way of ever knowing who saw them or photographed them until they surface somewhere in the world it s the most dangerous action he did coz of course he will have shownsoldused them for leverage,0
that s what happens when you hire an oan anchor as a lawyer,1
seven hundred documents each one for sale for million each can be quite a nice retirement fund remember trump has always been a transactional person and what he figures is his he feels perfectly in the right to sell to give as a gift for some favor,2
simple phrase to remember i expect and demand your loyalty,1
that is pure desperation im glad theyre safe ive spent years in poor rd world countries and i perfectly understand why some people will risk it all to get out of there and maybe be able to create a better life for them and their kids,1
did you find a boat i got a dresser but lets go,1
you know things are desperate when your furniture starts to resemble an oceangoing vessel im glad they were found by the cruise ship but did the cruise ship really have to make them handpaddle their way aboard,0
you got to respect a high group of people that are willing to risk their lives just to live for freedom,1
this is what desperation looks like im glad they were rescued hopefully they will be accepted into the country and have a chance at a better life we could use these hard working ingenuitive people to strengthen our nation,2
this happened on my thanksgiving cruise a few years back it was carnival fall we picked up immigrants fleeing from cuba,1
heck give these brave folks shelter and work just for heart and effort we need more people like this,2
i cant imagine the desperation,0
incredible guts,2
heck if they ended up in the usa they went from the frying pan into the fire things are not easier in the us there really is nowhere to run nowhere to hide from the harsh realities of trying to survive in this socalled modern world maybe an uncharted island in the middle of the pacific bring your own food and booze though,0
do republicans realize that we can see them its like jefferson davis trying to take credit for signing the th amendment which freed the slaves,0
they should include the wording in the legislation that the constituencies whose representatives vote against the bill won t get any money under the act,1
its called hypocrisy,0
thank you jake hold everyone regardless of affiliation accountable,2
the hypocrisy is out of control thanks jake for exposing these hypocritical people we need more of this,0
wouldnt it be fun if the fine print in these bills stated if you voted no your state will be excluded from receiving an allocation of the funds,0
that last question dont your constituents deserve the truth that doesnt apply to todays rethuglican party if your a liar your a republican and a good one at that,0
i love that mr jake tapper is shining a light on the deceptive practices by a bunch of the politicians and moreover that he very clearly states its not okay some politicians and even some of us voters have over time experienced an eroded sense of right and wrong its helpful to call attention to this because we as a nation need to start somewhere to recapture a normal good sense of ethics right and wrong matter to build a prosperous economy,1
of course they do what else do you expect from liars,0
the federal government guarantees the education loans the lending institution and the universitycollege are not liable for any of the loans thats the problem,0
it doesnt solve every problem in the higher education system so do nothing is analysis you really need to be in a very privileged and comfortable place to serve with a straight face,1
this is great for some people but you really need to regulate the actual universities who are charging absurd amounts and thatll get lobbied against hard by college corporations,0
remember it s only federal loans and those parents with less than stellar credit scores could not get federal loans,0
just or years ago going to university in america was free then corporate america took advantage of the educational system the problem is the educational system in america if you are a middle class or poor families going to university in america is a lifetime debt,0
as great as the debt relief is its just a band aid start capping the amount educational institutions can charge or set up training institutions that charge lower prices that others will have to compete with,1
harvard has billion with a b endowment loans should be by the colleges,1
it s the interest that compounds that becomes a problem puts graduate in a financial prison for years i paid my student loans and i support debt relief it was hard to pay of k because of interest,0
student loans should be dischargeable or modifiable in bankruptcy proceedings based on a proper showing of financial hardship it is absurd that the credit card debt on a spring break trip to cancun is unquestionably dischargeable by a bankruptcy court but tuition housing and fees for college are not,0
my mortgage just announced it identifies as a student loan,1
somos obrigados ouvir a cnn pra saber o que a esquerda pensa dif cil engolir esses comentaristas tendenciosos,1
t o simplesporque n o abrem todo o jogo pra que as elei es sejam as mais transparentes poss veis o que querem esconder,1
como um presente diz que n o h transpar ncia na elei o e foi eleito desde que o sistema eletr nico existe eu quero ver se ele tem coragem de defender isso num debate debate lamento o brasil ter chefe de na o t o despreparo,1
dinheiro bom dinheiro em obrada odebrecht,1
rid culo o tse nesse caso da reuni o com os embaixadores nega a transpar ncia e considera isso um ato antidemocratico e a imprensa joga lenha na fogueira pois a onda atacar o presidente,1
bolsonaro reeleito em,1
im a war veteran and i am watching my country being driven off a cliff in a clown car filled with conspiracy nut jobs terrific,0
forget about the evidence said no innocent individual ever more importantly his denial of democracy and proper judicial process is unfathomable,0
the pillow guy screaming forget about the evidence thats all you need to know about him and his followers,0
pretty difficult to change the opinions of people whose opinions dont require evidence especially not by presenting evidence to the contrary,0
just forget about the evidence this is how he started the statement,1
as a cybersecurity engineer i can say these people are the real deal and they are saying the right things this is how to do transparency for cybersecurity right democracy dies in darkness,1
no just forget about the evidence the gqp have swallowed that bs hook line and sinker,0
i remember when sidney powell said there were so many votes for trump it broke the algorithm i felt my iq drop when she said that i suspect several people developed actual brain cancer as a result,0
these fears and conspiracies really thrive in darkness spot on i find a lot of people that fall for this stuff simply dont bother to seek answers for the questions that they have they keep themselves in the dark on purpose,0
if you want to be a democracyyou better start damn acting like it thank you mr krebs,1
perfect defense for a bank robber your honor my client was just taking the money to a more secure location,0
word is lots truth is none lmao absolutely humbled,2
as someone with the correct clearance i can vouch just like so many of you that this guy didnt keep them in a place that meets requirements for storage of such materials also lying about all this is quick dismissal from your clearance ive seen people fail to get adjudicated for omission of one piece of information they thought wasnt important one lost it for keeping in touch with their mother who is from china their contact with their mother caused them to lose their tssci think about that and this guy and his followers think he did nothing wrong the level of failures here by the former president shows he is illequipped to handle said documents now its just one excuse after another day to day with the people who live in the real world of clearance all know that if we did of what he did we be effed time to put your values you claim into action republicans dont claim it only when its convenient,0
if all documents leaving the oval office were automatically declassified then there should at least be a record of which documents were removed otherwise anyone could take anything out and it would be declassified with no notice but it s just the same old game first excuse it falls apart so second excuse also falls flat so next excuse something is wrong if you have to change your explanation again and again cause they were proven wrong again and again,0
george said it best i was busy with this coup so didnt have time to pack,1
roughly as safe as as a year military officera jag attorney now a judge that ridiculous slimy phrase sets my teeth on edge it s like saying a honda civic hatchback is the same as a mercedes s class sedan because they both have wheels,0
opinion rudy is enabling after the fact and providing comfort to a traitor both men swore an oath so can be charged with treason and are clear and present dangers to this nation,0
he took his work home best line ever,2
whats in the box anderson cooper just killed me,0
where do they find these people ive sadly thought that everyday for years,0
this might be the time to track down all these threats and show some real consequences to the people that issue them or incite others to issue them this has to stop,0
the people that are making the threats need to be locked up,0
every single person that is found making threats or inciting this nonsense needs to be held accountable these brainwashed clowns are really willing to throw their lives away for a man that could care less about them on any level,0
if i called for the posting of the home address of the judge who signed a warrant for me id be in cuffs for interfering with an official investigation and obstruction of justice before the media ever found it,0
just stunning that the party once proud of standing with the military and for law and order just voted against helping veterans and now shows disrespect and distain for the law and those who serve shame on them,0
these are dark days when an individual can cause this much damage to a country,0
i ll never forget the devastating story of the judge who s information was posted online and consequently her teenaged son was murdered when he answered the door at their home this is not acceptable,0
whatever happened to the communicating a threat charge and now that its against the fbi you have to charge these people regardless if you feel if its meaningless or not when have the fbi been afraid to arrest people making death threats what has happened to our government,0
all the violent talk is dangerous because even the flippant stuff goads along the people who do finally take violent action it must all be considered serious real threats,0
in canada threats of any kind especially death threats are a chargeable offense,0
when someone finally says something on tv that you can t even say on the internet anymore wish this happened more often,2
interesting interview its incredible how discussion turn more and more intense and how roger gave his answers,2
respect to roger waters he looks at the root of the cause and not what the media feeds,2
this is what we need more of people from different views talking it out and hearing what the other has to say and even if it gets heated they can both shake hands in the end and see the others as equals too often nowadays nobody wants to hear what the otherside has to say they just want to shut it down by saying that their side is better than the other and nothing more,0
this is literally the st time i have watched anything from cnn in maybe years,2
the interviewer looks naive to me when he can t argues with waters he just avoids it by laughing,0
roger waters,2
this is my message strangers passing in the street by chance two separate glances meet and i am you and what i see is me wow,2
its always refreshing to hear great minds cutting through the bs and everyday talking points of the propaganda machines and handing them their ass on a plate hats off to you sir,2
i have more respect for roger than for any other living human being,2
he was reckless with documents people used to have to tape them back together from the trash can but i never known him to destroy documents what in the actual fuck this guy is a lawyer lmao,0
you just said he would throw documents away and at the end of the night people would have to go through the trashcans and dig documents out and tape them back together and then you said you dont believe he would destroy and documents so which is it,0
love how everyone becomes lawyers,2
the opportunity to return all of the documents was on the table for a year im sure that was the stated reason for warrant execution that stated if in the course of searching for the documents they find evidence having to do with the coup attempt they have every right to sieze that too,1
keeping from engaging in his main grift of collecting funds to finance his electioneering would seem to be the major benefit to the public in the moment,1
his demeanor says it all,2
any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never will be thomas jefferson,0
in my opinion there is a lot of people in trouble,0
the white house wouldn t have high level documents sitting around to put in boxes for interns to pack anyone who has worked with classified documents knows that,0
isn t he the legal parallel to donnie s doctor why do we give him weight why am i watching you ask someone to speculate am i incapable of doing so on my own,0
i used weed to quit cigarettes over years ago,1
with so many pot smokers now they should let the people in prison on weed related charges out,0
so rds of americans support legal pot but the federal government still says its illegal thanks for representing the will of the people,0
tobacco is almost all downsides and weed is almost all upsides hard to imagine anyone would prefer tobacco to cannabis,0
thats a good thing and honestly its probably been that way for a while just that some people didnt fess up to it while it was illegal in their state plus some people get their nicotine fix from non tobacco sources now anyway which wasnt really a thing until the past decade and a half,2
years of weed and never been in trouble with the law never been a slacker at school or work raised a good decent family nothing wrong with weed besides whens the last time you heard of weed related road rage never,1
legalize it tax it and pay for usa healthcare with it,1
am a boomer and have smoked weed for over years some people my age arent always truthful about whether they smoke or not,0
makes a positive change cannabis needs to be federally legalized needed tax dollars,2
more people use weed than tobacco ive waited all my life to see those words im so proud of all of us way to go,2
a people that elect corrupt politicians imposters thieves and traitors are not victims but accomplices george orwell,0
americans are sincerely hoping mg keep his words,1
quote of donald trump talking about the fifth amendment in election you see the mob takes the fifth he said during one rally in iowa if youre innocent why are you taking the fifth amendment,1
the question of whether to indict prosecute a former president is irrelevant and immaterial if hes guilty hes guilty,0
lets fight crime by prosecuting whiny orange politicians who got taped asking the attorney general in the state of georgia to find them votes,0
do it right and make sure it sticks but let s not take forever to do it,2
the question of who committed the crime is immaterial that is starting from a wrong premise and does not conform to justice principles in this investigation rather the question should be was a crime committed what crime had been committed and what does the law say about committing such a crime then justice should follow the law does not say unless such a person is a former president,0
france israel and south korea have charged and in two cases convictedone is still pending current or former heads of state in the last years both of the convictions led to prison sentences it hasnt damaged those countries they arent banana republics all this handwringing is pointless if any citizen is to have any faith at all left in the us justice system these crimes need to be charged regardless of the culprit,0
merrick garland is really the one us citizenpublic servant who is under more pressure than any of his country men or women up to and including the us president at this moment may he remain resolute,1
the most significant question of our time is the president of the united states above the law how the doj answers that will determine if democracy fails in america,0
as for me an american citizen i dont feel this has anything to do with political party but everything to do with honesty honor integrityyou dont take what isnt yours i dont care if the president is a republican democrat independentyou dont take government documents home with you its called theft thats a crimeanybody defending him is sicker than he is shame on them,0
merrick garland ain t resigning scott think again,1
we are going to eventually discover that he has already traded the contents of those classified documents for his own personal and financial gain wait for it,1
we all want to stop talking about dump as soon as he is indicted tried convicted and imprisoned as is appropriate according to the law,0
it should only end when justice prevails,1
yes enough hearings ive heard enough start the prosecutions,1
whenever the republican says raid the interviewer needs to respond with executed a lawful search for evidence of a crime which was obtained legally and if when they counter with hillary s emails they need to be reminded that trump was in office for four years and failed to lock her up so it s just an inflammatory phrase,0
sorry scott but garland wont be resigning there wouldnt have been a search warrant issued if there was a chance theyd come away with nothing,0
it would be an insult to american justice system for trump to get away with his accountability,0
the good thing about this is we will know exactly who to blame and hold accountable for the violence if it manifests gop and rump,0
falou e disse luciano hang amei,1
parab ns pela entrevista luciano,1
como que essas mensagens vazam para publico e o danone que j sabia da investiga o e nem a pgr sabia em tempo vamos sft explica como isso poss vel,1
imagina o que o xand o vai fazer se o lar pio for eleito deus nos livre de uma trag dia dessas,2
chega a ser rid cula a pergunta o senhor n o financia algum grupo que trama contra a democracia caramba colombo que pergunta hein acreditar que poss vel algum grupo acabar com a democracia no brasil como acreditar em saciperer,1
infelizmente n s estamos vivendo tempos obscuros mas se deus por n s n o tenhamos medo pois o senhor nos defender dessa maldi o que desejam impor sobre o brasil bolsonaro a solu o com certeza,1
foram mexer com o v io da havan kkkk deu nisso,1
que vergonha para a cnn com um time de reportes como esses dois totalmente despreparados,1
em toda minha vida nunca vi uma leva de jornalistas t o incompetentes e despreparados como a que temos atualmente,0
parab ns luciano muitos pensam como voc e vc representou bem a indigna o dessas pessoas em sua fala na rara oportunidade que eles d o as pessoas que apoiam o governo atual,1
its unpredidented that a former president should be subjec to a search of his home yep and so was inciting an insurrection and failing to oversee a peaceful transfer of power hypocrits much,0
i love how breach the confidence of the american public just means something that the gop doesn t agree with,0
he actually had the gall to say this is unprecedented when everything about trump is unprecedented,0
if the republicans win in the midterms what will the oversight look like oversight you gotta be kiddin me there wouldnt be any,0
but her emails coming to bite republicans in the butt,0
anyone being investigated by the fbi is not qualified to be the president of the united states donald trump august,0
there will be more classified information in his head than in his desk you think so he reportedly could not pay attention for seconds when he was briefed about anything i dont think anyone needs to worry about whats in his head regarding state secrets,0
this guy sweating bullets like hes a guilty school kid in the principals office she nailed his ass to the wall that is what an actual journalist does bravo,0
this representative should just say i dont care about the law if its someone that is in my party this is why america is in such a mess the representatives dont do their jobs,0
so this guy whos been the head of the intelligence committee wants to see lots of things from the justice department and fbi now that some action is finally happening involving djts crimes although apparently he was fine with seeing nothing in the last five years of criminal behavior,0
its getting easier to tell by the look on their faces that they dont believe what they are saying,0
it still amazes me that in a country where even the most charming of cussing is beeped away to not shock sensitive souls all of this public deceit dangerous rethoric and violence promotion is tolerated put on display and broadcasted enthusiastically,0
when youre attacking fbi agents because youre under criminal investigation youre losing sarah huckabee sanders wrote in nov,0
i do hope that some people in the us with some common sense know how dangerous the situation is they re in,0
hold bannon accountable for disinformation,0
how did they plant evidence when the whole search was watched on cctv,1
desecrating mara largo isnt that what happened at the capitol on jan th,0
steve bannon calling people lawless priceless,0
i swear its a tragic comedy we are witnessing,0
i really appreciate your news channel but listen to this guy is too painful for me and i am very sorry to spend on a few seconds to make my comments thank you,0
bravo jon king the way he can stay emotionally detached from such bs to let the news speak for itself is extraordinary,2
when you get to a point where the republicans say touch nancy and we ridin you gotta take a moment of pause,1
i love how the ambassador talks in circles and refuses to respond to any of the points that are being made,1
glad to see us standing up to them good on us for going there good on cnn for standing strong ass well,2
people should do whatever we want or we will throw a fit and whatever we do will be your fault actual adults with power,1
love the part where his teleprompter goes off and he looks briefly to his far left then starts reading off a paper on his desk instead,2
in the s a company i was working in moved operations to china at the time i was thinking what dumbasses and not just because it cost me and my fellow employees our jobs i figured it was just a matter of time before china and the us would be at an impasse and all these companies were going to get yanked out of china were close and while it took longer than i figured but we should start diversifying where our supply chain is located,0

no more wire hangers this is what a complete and total cult transformation looks like look at the difference just in her demeanor and her physical appearance when she was supporting cheney and how psychotic and dead behind the eyes she looks currently she s got that marshall applewhite from heavens gate look down pat,0
remember the days when representatives acted on their promises regardless of family ties to washington,1
she did the right thing integrity means everything,2
politicians need to remember they are elected to represent the voters not to do as they please,1
as a veteran i think back to my military service the oath i took weighs heavily on me right now at the time i wasnt permitted to just say anything that i wanted to my first amendment right to free speech wasnt stripped from me but it was temperedthis wasnt some abysmal violation of my rights i willingly undertook this at the time its high time to pass legislation that holds criminal penalties for candidates and officials who knowingly lie in the face of legally established facts and precedent during bids to seek office and while engaged in the tasks of their office this age of obfuscation has to end with a gaveling that wont let th weeds grow back this is toxic to democracy and if it isnt ended soon this new face of fascism will take countless lives and damage to unseat once its entrenchment is complete the coup is ongoing you see,0

thank you mitch mcconnell for stifling obamas appointment of merritt garland to the supreme courtthe force was at work to save him for a better job of a lifetime to rescue this nation from the rabid demagogues set on destroying our country a deranged unprecedented president calls for legal unprecedented actions,0
as a non american i have to say it s pretty funny to finally watch donald get in bigboy trouble,2
top secret and top secret sci sensitive compartmented information as someone who once held military and then civilian clearances necessary to serve in the naval nuclear field then work on several ultrasensitive nuclear and weapons programs the safeguards surrounding these materials are manifold and complex these materials cant be declassified on a whim and certainly dont belong outside of a secure facility none of this passes the smell test in fact it stinks to high heaven let us not forget what did with records pertaining to his infamous call with president zelenskyy information was reclassified then stored under code word protocols could this be some of the material the former president unlawfully had in his possession only time will tell,0
he should be in interrogation to find out exactly what he gave to exactly who,1
they should have arrested and charged him when they retrieved the first boxes he was guilty then that would have allowed them to rip that place apart to look for more if anyone else had taken those same records we would be in prison for life trump did it and they just went and took them back why did trump want them in the first place,0
trump the warrant cannot be released because it needs to be audited,0
what is one of the first things a defense lawyer will do when faced with anyone who has vital information that can result in the summary conviction of their client if you cant discredit the evidence discredit the witness by any means possible either through facts relevant or otherwise or innuendoes that is exactly what trump and the republican party are attempting to do,0
once youre fired from your job you cant take documents off the premises,0
trump in i can stand in the middle of fifth avenue and sell nuclear secrets to the saudis and i wouldnt lose any voters,1
put a stickyfingered airhead in the top office of a world power and set back your nation s security and prominence in the world by decades it has been said that a people gets the leader that they deserve this should be cause for deep national introspection,1

i think she should run for president as a democrat,1
cheney might run for potus now that ive finished laughing all i can say is good luck with that liz,1
go for it,2
glad to hear that,2
good for her,2
extraordinary challenges require extraordinary measures exciting times indeed,2
trumps going to end dementia joe heels up harris warmonger the house drinker and numerous other demonrat careers,0
democrats years ago the cheney family is a bunch of war criminals democrats today i think we should let a cheney run the white house again i agree with none of her policies but at least she hated orange man,0
joe should give liz some kind of appointment in his administration that would shake things up,1
breaking trump hires billion dollar lawyer me i hope he is willing to work pro bono because trump will never pay,1
i think this man ended up exactly in the role he should fulfill and only sorry for the crap he was subjected to we are all beholden and im grateful personally,2
i cant even imagine the kind of pressure our ag is under he has the weight of the american public on him he also has the trump mafia on him and his family,0
sane americans aka real patriots thank you for your great service sir,2
thank you sir thats how an attorney general does it,2
trump played right into garlands hands,0
if you wanna be successful you most take take responsibility for your emotions not place the blame on others in addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability theres always a risk in every investment yet people still invest and succeed you must look outward if you wanna be successful in life,1
what a honor to have this man in our justice he has backbone what a honorable honest man i am so proud of him for standing with his justice and fbi,2
i love how he got up there and pretty much said yeah i signed off on it what about it i dont stand at all for his political affiliation but i do respect that he seems to be doing his job on this,2
thank you ag garland now i feel our country is land of law and order,2
i don t understand aren t we all for law and order and no one is above the law it seems to me that the doj and fbi should investigate anyone that might have done anything that a normal person like us would be investigated for and possibly go to jail all corrupt politicians should be investigated regardless of party,0
i look forward to the facts of this coming out and then seeing mccarthy backpedal his comment also mccarthy preserve your documents where was this enthusiasm for the secret service deleted texts,1
i find it interesting that when law enforcement does its job these gentlemen would choose to obstruct the persuit of justice rather than support investigators doing their jobs,0
look the fact is this these clowns have always taught they were above the law they can not accept the reality,0
judges do not issue search warrants they sign and authorize them,0
what were they looking for i don t know what wrongdoing do they suspect and why i don t know what did they find i don t know was it justified absolutely not tyranny do you know or care how utterly stupid such reasoning is,0
you dont get singled out by the doj unless theres a pretty firm belief of a crime,1
kevin mccarthy s statement can be used against him as a threat made by him if at all the gop takes the house sensible american would not vote for him this time,0
waiting for the facts is the last thing on their minds,1
this is just overreach by my political opponents charles manson,0
only guilty people take the fifth the mob takes the fifth donald trump agreed donald,1
if youre innocent why ya taking the fifth amendment,1
im pretty sure we all saw that coming,1
he said it himself if you are innocent why would you take the fifth amendment,0
theyre asking the wrong questions you have to ask him something on topic that he wants to answer and just let him talk hell end up answering about questions you didnt think youd get an answer to let him talk hes his own worst enemy,0
he does everything he accuses his opponents of doing publicly on video openly and his supporters say it doesnt happen you cant argue or debate that you can only ignore stupidity at the level of the average republican citizen at least as far as deciding who to charge,0
i took the fifth nobody takes the fifth better than i do in fact there has never been anyone in the history of this great country who has taken the fifth better than i have nor is there anyone who knows as much about taking the fifth as me,2
ted cruz is a total hypocrite and until recently a canadian citizen who may not even have a legal right to run for president donald trump,0
well for the first time in his life he s telling the truth pleading the th is an admission of guilt that he has committed crimes,0
i wanted to talk but my lawyer wouldnt let me will be trumps excuse,0
in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends mlk jr,1
so pence just confirmed there are two sets of justice one for politicians and one for the rest of us,1
just subpoena him hes just doing this to stall for time hell string them along for weeks if not months and then in the end say no he changed his mind and then they will have to subpoena him anyway so just cut to the chase already get it done,0
for me as a foreigner i see pence as the personification of the smooth talking us politician and believe me i dont mean this as a compliment,1
i always wondered why the jan th committee and or the doj haven t brought him in for testimony,1
i always need a shower after listening to our former vice president,1
hed consider honoring the constitution and rule of law how big of him,1
the answer could had been yes or no listening to his talking points tell you he s a hypocrite,0
this is not that tough he is saying send me a subpoena so i have a legal excuse against the lunatics in my own party,0
the unique role of honoring your oath while trying to avoid being murdered by a mob of cranked up conspiracy theorists,0
he said that money isnt free it was free when they were giving away tax cuts to billionaires,1
im baffled by the way to different sides interpret a win for the average american spending taxes for the republicans is good as long as its on military equipment breaks for the corporations its bad spending if its tax breaks lower healthcare prices anything that helps the average american taxpayer who by the way is paying taxes already themselves its insanity,0
id rather see that money that comes from u and me go to climate and helping the of us that are losing ground economically as opposed to the republicans method of refusing to use money for anything unless it benefits the richest and only the richest amongst us,1
mitch mcconnell we have no policies,1
these arent executive orders these are passing as law,1
yes david that money does come from the people and should be spent on the people in ways that helps us duh,1
late in the game joe biden s only been in office a little over a year and a half late in the game,0
regardless of which side of the aisle you vite for i dont believe for a second that any regular american is going to shed a tear or lose any sleep over billion dollar corporations having to pay their fair share of taxes,0
senators are making money with all the cooperations handing money to them to get their way but if americans might benefit well that is a different story isn t it,1
i wish guests would answer questionsand then make their points,1
the truth has no defence against a fool determined to believe a lie mark twain,1
its nice to see neighbors playing dressup and role play on a fine summer day must be nice to not have a job you have to go to somehow i just cannot understand how playing dressup makes people feel like they belong to something,0
fbi need to shut this down now before it s too late,1
take matters in their own hands fbi they need to hold these senators accountable for their actions,1
the only items redacted in the publicly available copy of the search warrant are the names of the fbi agents so why did dt later show his copy the only difference is that it shows the names the phrase aiding and abetting comes to mind,1
these are actual adults who never grew beyond juvenile delinquency,0
someone was in high school he refuses to listen to teachers and even refused to read books so now that he is not anymore a student he suddenly wants to listen to teachers and read books something is wrong somewhere with donald,0
they are so clueless of how the entire thing was done how all the evidence was gathered what goes into getting a warrant it didnt happen over night,0
hahah hilarious its like adult children carrying guns around like youre going to take on the fbi,0
also dont they have a job or something how can they afford to stay there doing nothing,0
if you are going to put liars like mulvaney on air you need to stop them and push back every time they lie dont just let them build a big case based on unfounded assertions,0
mishandling of classified documents is a felony no intent or plans are relevant having those documents was a crime period,0
documents theres a difference between documents and classified information mick how the hell were you in the whitehouse,0
just documents classified documents in unauthorized hands and insecure property is just documents,0
im not defending destroying documents im just defending the man who broke a federal law for destroying documents,0
this guy is an insufferable weasel stop inviting him to speak,0
its interviews like this that give people like him legitimacy when they dont deserve any giving a platform to dishonesty is not balance or equity,0
nobody is asking why did trump need to take any of these documents how is it mulvaney is focused on procedure impropriety and confidence in rhe fbi and not wondering why after months they resorted to going thru all these steps undoubtedly they ask pretty please for at least months another example of the best people,0
if the president ripped up a document we taped it back togetheri never saw the intentional destruction of documents i saw documents handled in the ordinary course of business they might be defaced we fixed them how is ripping up a document considered to be in the ordinary course of business hes admitted that they were defaced,0
you cant have the weaponization of the federal government mick mulvaney this is a very common republican tacticto foist an opinion into a narrative that carries insistently the color of being irrefutable fact,1
imagine being forced to cheerlead the company that just fired you,0
the fact that stelter was sacked before lubin toobin says a lot,0
can t wait to hear mark dice do his voice over on this one wow stelteryou got a three decade old show canceled how bad do you have to be we know we know you are a scoundrel and the media is better now that you re gone he said he s excited to watch cnn and root for them what a lie the fake applause at the end is appropriate of this lousy host,0
i didnt know his show was called reliable sources reality sure is funnier than fiction,2
probably the most views hes ever gotten on his farewell,1
funniest part is when the sound guy started playing music to hasten the wrap up,1
watching stelter commentate about how this show was the standard of journalism despite being cancelled due to losing all of its credibility to the point where no one was even watching anymore is exactly the way reliable sources should end haha its truly poetic,1
the body language experts are going to have fun with this,2
i wish i could b like him crying inside but bragging outside,1
the irony of his show being called reliable sources,1
trump said only the guilty take the th amendment well who are we to argue,1
i think trump s ties to the saudis pushed this search over the edge its a matter of national security,1
if you are innocent why are you taking the th amendment trump,0
what nobody is talking about is the leads when a search warrant is presented to a judge the affiant explains exactly what they re looking for and where to find it the person or persons or tipsters on this sealed affidavit has intimate knowledge of what could be found taken and where it could be located in that supersecure gigantic complex of maralago was it a close personal lawyer ivanka or jared melania wesselberg eric don jr or donald himself as part of a pending plea deal somebody was pressed out big time to give away the information used in the statement of probable cause and i wonder what charges are pending for those people as well,1
you see the mob takes the fifth trump if you re innocent why are you taking the fifth amendment trump fifth amendment fifth amendment horrible trump,0
same as watergate not hardly i was a teenager when it happened and i seem to know more than trump knows about it,1
media has been focused on the fbi search and not about the classified documents trump had in his homewhy he took themwhy he didnt give them back when asked and what he could possibly do with that information glad to see this has been the focus here,1
why does no one ask why he took them why its taken so long to get it back and can the people who helped take the documents be held accountable too,0
the fbi didnt break into mar a lago,1
so ive been reading republican feedback that it is totally fine for trump to take government docs as long as they dont contain sensitive info or that its fine for trump to keep docs because theyre safe at mar a lago with all the security he enjoys that sounds so off right,0
rent is going up because stock companies are buying up all the properties and they will charge the highest amount they can,1
i am a landlord and realize i could get so much more for my wellmaintained and in a great neighborhood houses i have chosen over the plus years of owning these homes that i would rather treat people fairly and respectfully i did not raise rents for many years in nc landlords can only raise rents by per year because i did not do that my tenants are paying a few hundred dollars below what i could get with new tenants i have had tenants for more than years we all become a part of each others lives i care about my tenants please do not bash all landlords good landlords do care about their tenants,1
if the market is so heavily effected by a tweet then it isnt based in reality a home gallons of gas or milk etc are always in demand and you cant say the price doubled because of economics why do economy dynamics always favor the rich the prices never fall when the current crisis is over not significantly,0
people were saying there would be a housing cash there are companies buying up home to turn owning a home into a business pricing regular people out of buying a house there is a shortage of homes and las vegas i havent seen the prices go down greedy companies are pricing renters out of the ability to find a place to rent,0
part of the problem is millions sold their homes to large companies like black rock instead of to actual families those type of companies want money so they jack up the rent and never sell those homes to families i know everyone want money but think twice about selling your home to those companies every time you do you prevent other families from being able to afford a home and subject them to outrageous rent prices i speak from experience,0
so its basically greed got it theres too much money out there lets change that,0
that is a load of crap the reason rents are going up is corporations buying up rentals houses apartment buildings and then escalating the rent to make money mortgage rates are not that high look what they were under reagan now that was high,0
rents are going up because of greed,0
wtf makes landlords think theyre entitled to make up for pandemicrelated losses why are they special and deserving of being immune and exempted from taking a hit can all the people who werent able to go to work for several months and had to live off of their savings or become homeless demand a raise to make up for the money they didnt make why are landlords and banks and such allowed to demand to not share the burden,0
at least in my town we have old zoning law that prevents thousands of affordable lots from being developed lift that restriction and ideally streamline permitting and loosen regulations but they wont too much local vested interest in keeping the supply down i know my town isnt the only one with this zoning law,0
i dont think he was careless in taking these documentsi believe he and others around him knew exactly what they were doing,1
its pretty simple its illegal to take things that dont belong to you,1
those of us who had security clearances while serving in the military know how truly serious the mishandling and appropriation of classified materials is,0
all president trump had to do was give the fbijustice department all of those documents that they wanted the first time that he got a subpoena and there wouldnt be all of this drama right now once again he creates problems and then blames others when they have to clean up his mess,0
for once hold this crook accountable lock him up,0
i had a tssci clearance when i was in the air force i had to go into a special facility called a scif that was under hour armed guard etc to even have access to that type of information unbelievable,0
the question is why wasnt he arrested back when it was first discovered hes taken the documents he claims that his staff must have accidentally grabbed them with the moving boxes as he was leaving the wh has that ever happened before has any other president accidentally moved over boxes full of classified documents when they left,0
can we now say lock him up,0
classified documents in a home and location with golf tournament funded by foreign nationals perfect point for exchange,2
does anyone remember dump saying im the president i can do anything i want to do i remember that sick man with a god complex and obviously a very sick man,0
the party instructed you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears this was their final most essential command george orwell,1
put him to jail and i will believe no man is above the law not even current and previous presidents,0
who knew there were so many traitors living amongst us,0
making falsehoods to the public like the ones he is spouting need to be made illegal with steep punishments this is not exercising free speech he and his filthy ignorant supporters have no qualms about creating more societal chaos with their abject lies this practice needs to be brought to an end,0
well if the documents were planted then how could he possibly have declassified them,0
the day trump left officei remember a comment being made about him taking documentsand the comment waswhy is he taking those documents,0
criminals are gonna protect other criminals thats how it works,0
if my neighbor robs a bank and a few weeks later i decide to rob the same bank it makes no difference i would have committed a serious crime regardless and exactly how did agents sneak in and plant plus boxes of evidence in advance of the raid in supposedly secure locked rooms and safes with video security and guards and secret service on the property omg ridiculous,0
that s because his allies know that they are soon to be coconspirators,1
it should be illegal for politicians to lie to the public or mis lead the public intentionally,0
as a an exmilitary man i would like to know which oath he swore to,1
he was a captain as a veteran of the us army i am appalled that someone in the military would act this way i said this before and ill say it again i am proud to have worn the uniform im just not proud of who else has sabatini is a clown and a disgrace to the uniform and the country,0
its disgusting and horrifying that there are people walking around like this especially if hes aspiring to be in any position of power,0
as a former military officer myself i cannot fathom how sabatini ever passed a background check let alone became an infantry officer his actions and comments are a classic example of conduct unbecoming of an officer he needs to resign from the national guard before he destroys its reputation,0
as another viewer from outside it s quite appalling that people vote for such crazy and dangerous people the issue with protecting the right to talk absolute nonsense is that there are a significant number of people who are simply not smart enough to recognise it,0
they know full well what they are doing theyve shown repeatedly that they dont care about the constitution or laws that hold them accountable laws are for everyone else they are just pulling everyones leg its simply and literally a game to them thats what abusers do,0
whenever i think about moving back to the us florida being my home state and i see these videos it s just a gut punch how deluded can a society become,0
an honest but mistaken man once shown the truth either ceases to be mistaken or ceases to be honest a people that elect corrupt politicians imposters thieves and traitors are not victims but accomplices george orwell,0
real republicans would feel their skin crawl looking at that interview with the florida man what did trump do to them,0
apparently he forgot the oath he took when he signed up for his service,0
i disagree and heres what i think the real problem islegitimate law firms with good reputations dont want to be remembered as the agency who represented benedict donald,0
i think its a challenging assignment yes defending the indefensible always is,1
the trouble is that this man hit the nail on the head when he said that he would find it inappropriate to become part of a team attempting to tear down the justice system you could start off with the best of intentions but in no time at all you would find yourself standing in shit up to your neck there is no way of working with trump and doing it right forget it,0
heres what i got from this this man is a very good lawyer and still believes in the law it was no mistake that he mentioned twice that he would never do anything unethical and he would tell the threats and other bullcrap to stop what he didnt say was that we all know both of those things go very against trumps mo he is a very wise lawyer not to get mixed up in trump,1
well we know he has one attorney that has had to go to jail for him another attorney who is about to be indicted and another attorney testifying in front of the january th committee so i think its safe to say that most smart attorneys are not going to think that representing this man is worth it plus they know they wont get paid,0
it turns out that competent lawyers wont actually sit in front of a federal judge and lie for you,0
i can see why he is a good lawyer from just this short interview he side stepped politics he side stepped trump and he side stepped angering trumps followers all the while being respectful to everybody he is in a different class and not a mud slinger he has his own reputation to think about smart and honest people dont get involved with trump,1
i would have to give up all of my other clients yes code for he does not want to be disbarred like rudy no honest lawyer can defend pos,0
one of the saddest lessons of history is this if we ve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle we re no longer interested in finding out the truth the bamboozle has captured us it s simply too painful to acknowledge even to ourselves that we ve been taken once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it back carl sagan,0
theres a huge difference between saying i represented the president of the united states and i represented donald trump theres a reason that many people who worked in the trump administration are concerned about future employment opportunities,0
he lost me at it makes us look like extremist democrats why the hell can these people not respond to a direct question about their behavior without trying to deflect to democrats,0
respect for defending our country respect for being a navy seal respect for everything you sacrificed for our country respect for wanting to continue to serve our country through politics no respect for you as a politician though nearly everything you said was bullshit,0
this man crenshaw probably had access to this type of material when he was a seal on active duty knows the gravity these documents held for him to standup and defend someone who violated the protocol associated with these materials is an insult to the men and women who secure these documents and keep us safe,0
he lost me at it makes us look like extremist democrats why the hell can these people not respond to a direct question about their behavior without trying to deflect to democratsi agree with ms claire what is he talking about if a democrat was doing what trump was doing what would he say and do take some bloody responsibility,0
sure he s a nice guy has a military background and looks like russell crowe if he had any selfrespect left he d be cheering for liz cheney,1
there are ways to resolve that issue yeah like not stonewalling the national archives for a year and a half or signing a sworn affidavit that youve returned all the records when its a blatant lie,0
how many people out there would have several months to comply with felony related inquiries to keep you out of prison even one chance to provide these documents is one more than any one else would have been given,0
you know what trips me out is that instead of just taking responsibility these political hacks point out when the other side did it and pointing fingers instead of being a normal adult and just take responsibility,0
so dan crenshaws argument is noone is above the law except if theres an election and or in politicians are above the process law,1
its interesting that crenshaw was blatant in saying i want to be honest with you psychology teaches that when someone says that they want to or are going to be honest they are about to lie to you,1
sen ron johnson just went on record saying that he wants to end social security and medicare as we know it in wisconsin we are fighting back to defend these programs sign the petition to save these programs that greatly benefit all of us,1
mr mcconnell please retire it s simply time for you to go,0
i say this to my republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible there will come a day when donald trump is gone but your dishonor will remain liz cheney the stain will never wash out,0
i m just shocked by some peoples voting habits dem margins need to widen not shrink not to mention gerrymandering or redistricting is still a major issue,0
the fact that raphael warnock is leading by only four points should allow the world to see that something is very very wrong with the voters of the united states,0
mcconnells only goal is to become senate leader again why listen to him he acts only in selfinterest not for the good of americans hes supposed to be representing i think he cares who is in the white house not for americans interests but he cares like all narcissists only about how that president would impact his power mcconnell has refused to do his job for years by sitting on bills that americans want passed and refusing to act in fact he has been smugly crowing about it mcconnell like trump is very angry that he lost his position his only focus concern is getting his power back he has been in congress way too long hes secured his millions his days of glory are over he should be removed from office,0
since arriving in the senate in ron johnson has repeatedly backed policies that would leave veterans out in the cold including voting against expanded healthcare job training and educational opportunities for those who have served in uniform ron johnson s record makes clear that he has not served in the senate with the best interests of wisconsin veterans in mind,0
americans are getting fedup with the lack of a reasonable and comprehensive set of policies by the gop coupled with the extremist and radical views of so many of their members in the house and the senate,0
what a moody manipulative and selfserving man mitch mcconnell is,0
republicans wouldnt have a chance in the house if it represented the people like it is supposed to gerrymandering has destroyed the house,0
they are cowards and history will show it well said,0
i wish we could see more of sam donaldson its so nice to hear this gentleman speak,2
it is so good to hear sams voice again such a clear communicator and so evenkeeled,2
a lot of these socalled journalists should take notes on how to report the news truthfully from legendary journalists like sam donaldson he knows how to do news,1
theyre afraid and theyre cowards and history will show it that is a powerful statement which is probably lost on trump and his cronies,0
it s great to see sam donaldson such a legend such wisdom,2
sam donaldson is indeed a national treasure he seems to think we can get through this,2
sam donaldson is a legend yeah im a political nerd and i grew up watching mr donaldson he got me interested in politics and government i just love these old school gentlemen and their approach to journalism i hope to hear more from mr donaldson in the future,2
fair reasonable and intelligent miss this man and his articulate analysis of events,1
excellent interview sam donaldson is so articulate in describing the circumstances re the events of watergate compared with trumps perfidious nature and the difference between republicans then and now,1
i like national security documents that didn t have to be rescued from an expresident s club basement by the fbi,1
in the course of appealing my divorce settlement which was made without me even being in the room the judge told the opposing attorney you lied to me if you dont go outside and settle with this man ill make sure you never win another case in this court so long as im presiding judge yes folks it happens orders get pencil whipped all the time,0
they should redact them the exact same as barr done to the mueller report,1
doj sure we will release pages of blacked out paper lol,1
the question i want answered is how did top secret documents kept in a secure location only to be viewed by someone with the highest security clearance who had to request then be approved and then wait in a skiff for an armed guard to bring said documents where they may be viewed sans any electronic devices and then when finished viewing surrender any notes taken and finally replaced under guard to top secret storage make their way to the trump white house pretty good question then it begs the question who in the trump administration had the security clearance to get them and how were they removed just asking,1
pressure from the public how has the public put pressure on the judge pressure has come from media outlets how can americans help the judge understand that we dont need or want to see the affidavit in my opinion what americans want is for the dojfbi investigation to continue unimpeded and to continue without witness intimidation,0
release nothing make the public press wait theres gonna be time enough for curiosities news talk programmes and newspapers to be amply catered for after the gavel has dropped on this affair,1
all those classified documents have been compromised may as well tell the about the damage and start looking for the copies he was planning to blackmail local government and foreign,0
just redact it as much as they redacted the meullers report that should do it,1
this made me google judge vs magistrate judge the response most suited to my question read generally both judges and magistrates have the same general authority when it comes to hearing your case ruling on objections and determining the outcome however a judge has more power than a magistrate also appealing the decision of a magistrate and a judge illicit different processes as well further reading of google blurbs revealed that magistrates can only decide civil cases they can handle pretrial issues in criminal cases but they are not the last word the ultimate decision maker in criminal cases any knowledgeable lawyers or judges out there please respond whether this is correct thank you,1
you mean putin didnt tell the truth im utterly shocked i mean noone saw that coming did they lol,0
that assessment about the nuclear plant was very eye opening it could be putins way out of this but that would rely on him having any regard for his soldiers which up until now he has not shown,1
excellent guest very cleareyed no hype,2
this has nothing to do with hybrid warfare call it what it is terrorism simple plain cowardly terrorism,0
just a thought russia could do a lot of damage short of causing a meltdown make the reactors unusable contaminate the site etc,0
erin is so unbiased integrity is just a word in the dictionary to her much like virtue,1
lets not forget that when the iranian regime offered military support to russia by providing striking drones to fuel the russian aggression in ukraine our arab allies partners were working closely with secretary austin to open their warehouses to provide ukraine with thousands rounds of mm himars missiles in addition other forms of military tools to help ukraine protect itself,1
us has of the a jets in service f and f are available with over in service capable of refueling mid air f and f are not in the training pipeline at this time,1
usually when russians say their foe is doing something inhumane it is a clear sign that they are about to commit that very same crime themselves,0
how can it be the russians shelling it when it hasnt been shelled for months,0
as someone who does not live in the united states can anyone explain to me why the country is being held hostage by the nations halfwits,0

the abe lincoln joke so youre not a fan of theatrics had me rolling in laughter,2
i have to admit when hillary first called these people a basket of deplorables i winced and recoiled in embarrassment but now,0
how can jordan keep a straight face while talking to these people i love him hes fantastic,2
kleppler is pure genius he has a way to engage folks without them knowingly being insulted simply fascinating,2
one of the things that always puzzled me why would they pick jfk jr the whole kennedy family is democrat do they not know that either,0
my god these were the people that got trump elected in maybe a requirement to vote shouldnt be your age but your iq,0
the older i get i am finding that i dont have any patience for cult members who deliberately choose to be stupid i cant even watch it,0
going from a civil rights lawyer representing the aclu to calling it an honor to rep trump and bannon is a very weird bag,0
i cannot believe this former civil rights lawyer just spouted rightwing rhetoric wtf,0
it still amazes me how adult professionals continue to make excuses for the former potus let alone an adult who behaves more like a bad child than a leader of the free world,0
i am an attorney and in the course of my career i have defended some pretty bad people but i have my limits i would decline to represent someone like bannon or trump i wouldn t want that stink on me,0
this is the kind of lawyer who would have been greatly honored to represent benedict arnold,2
what a sad lawyer that must be for him to consider it a great honor to represent donald trump hahahahah,0
he didnt believe he was doing anything wrong by refusing to turn over these documents who in their right mind would want such a weak minded person that refuses to listen to advisors as president,0
two questions to this lawyer what is honor what is it about donald trump that makes is it an honor to represent him,1
representing steve bannon that will assure you a place in hell,0
ex trump lawyer still defending him i can not believe how they stick with him,0
a good thing biden stopped him getting daily briefings,1
you dont have to be a big strong man to be a big strong man thank you merrick garland,2
work at a bank and take work home fired happened to me work as a president and take classified work home that could not was but could be stolen or used against the us technically by the books they re supposed to be automatically safely assumed to be a traitor removed from any office and jailed for life technically speaking in a perfect world,0
remember him once saying during an interview i dont stand behind anything after all hes shown us of himself if you believe anything he says now youre a fool after it is released he will tell his followers look i had no privacy at all they had no right to release this info,0
clear businesslike and surgical presentation thank you mister gonzales may justice prevail,2
first he got fired then he tried to steal anything not nailed down all the while he running around yelling stop the steal,0
every time this guy still says i dont know we have to see what happens thats this attorneys answer to everything,0
great job merrick garland i knew in my heart you would come through kudos,2
thats why its important to pretend those documents are in the home of a private person,1
this is driving me crazy why isnt the media not asking the key question why did he take the documents,0
im bored of the trump realityshow can we skip ahead to the part where hes in jail and fading from memory,0
the best way to get a narcissist is to figure out their weakness and fears under the facade of a tough narcissist is a fearful person always seeking to boost their ego,0
a grade school teacher i once had used to tell us repeatedly your sins will find you out trump must have skipped all those classes that would explain his reckless criminality on so many levels not to mention his basic stupidity as far as michael cohen is concerned theres a guy who not only uses his brain but demonstrates courage contrition humility and a renewed sense of civic pride in stark contrast to any trump behavior,0
did michael cohen say maralardo if so he is totally hilarious,2
so glad to see mike having his days he deserves it all the way so glad to have you on our side mike,2
ironically trump himself signed a law in that made it a felony to remove and retain classified documents,0
i love it how this guy hits everything right on the nail i swear he can read this guy like a book,2
what really got me out of the cult was the incarceration thankyou for your honesty it usually is by circumstance rather than virtue that we change our ways,1
i love michael cohen he s a straight shooter glad he s seen the light also i want to thank all the commenters who support this doj and the upholding the law against such an egregious criminal organization and it s members it gives me so much hope thank you all so much,2
how did we ever come to this if i were a younger person starting out in this world i would strongly concider not bringing a child into the world my heart soul are broken for what everyone faces ahead in prayers will we be here the best of all possible worlds,0
personally i think education or specifically a lack thereof is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this because ignorance breeds fear and distrust especially in things that are new or foreign when i was in elementary school back in the s i was reading my way through my schools scifi section it was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics asimov bova bradbury campbell clarke doc smith heinlein and then i got to verne id just finished up leagues and was getting into journey to the center of the earth when i found a page had been ripped from the book being a good student i reported it to the librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that i was reading this particular book it was above my level she said and too difficult for me this was a hundredyearold story at this point and i was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on creature feature on saturdays but she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there a short time later i overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star a meteor that many had seen a night or two before the librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible the heavens are permanent the stars dont move as the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her and the longer that conversation went on the more even i maybe or years old at the time realized the scifi books she had removed werent above my level they were above her level she had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away and unfortunately it sounds like that sort of mindset hasnt changed all that much in the or so years since then,0
whenever i heard a book was banned from my school library i would immediately check it out from the public library i learned a lot about menstruation from dear god it s me margaret one summer i was and completely traumatized when i realized it happens to my mom too i m not helping here my point being more students will now read these books than before banning them,0
when one parent doesnt want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it that sounds more like indoctrination than education instead of removing the book from the whole school they should just disallow that one student access to the book sorry johnny you cant check out that book because your parents said so,0
i m a pubic school teacher this is part of the reason that there is a shortage of qualified teachers teachers are just sick and tired of being sick and tired they are finding jobs where they are respected,0
this downward spiral of our country should scare every single one of us well those of us who actually know history and what all this kind of nonsense can lead to scary indeed,0
for a country with a terrible education rating in the world youre doing your best to fall further down the list,0
i remember my high school history teacher saying its a race between education and catastrophe,0
people who begin by burning books will end by burning people heinrich heine,0
i took a course in college called the bible as literature it analyzed the bible not so much as being a gospel but as being a text and considering some of the incentives and bases for as much of the propositions that were contained in this script it was a pretty interesting class one of the few i still remember from my undergrad days,2
it s absolutely ridiculous to try stop anyone from reading what they want they ll just find another way even your kids the perpetuation of ignorance is the true concern,0
it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it,0
my personal opinion did the assistant truly accidentally send the phone logs i don t think she did that accidentally,1
if jones didnt do it on purpose then why is he still doing it everyday during his trial,0
its also difficult to get someone to tell the truth when his salary depends on him lying,0
first sentence and he started to liedid not do this mistake on purpose so out of accident he reported on this matter over the course of years numerous times but it wasnt intentional he just asked questions and ohhe lied over and over and over again this guy will never admit his wrongs morally compromised he is nothing else,0
theres no accounting at his business irs are you listening how could this possibly be true,0
yyyyyyeahh i dont buy the whole i didnt know bit re his lawyers sending two years of his texts to the plaintiffs lawyers his response was swift and appeared to me to be calculated im thinking especially since this is not the first time his lawyers have done this that they were hoping for mistrial or at least having the evidence removed from record as it includes all sorts of stuff anywho would you react as quickly as he did no pause no hesitation he was ready for that big reveal,1
so he s still lying about his intention how much more could he possibly pay in light of the fact we know he s still lying about this situation why do people follow him if they know he s lying,0
alex jones defense might actually be brilliant i didnt do it on purpose look at the lawyer he hired sent the prosecution all the evidence they needed i didnt do it on purpose he lied under oath i didnt do it on purpose i mean hes clearly guilty of torturing the victims of an elementary school shooting his choosen defense is the only option that had at least a chance of working but ultimately him hiding his own money so he can declare bankruptcy defense is much stronger the old white man defense,0
the company had no accounting dept how is that possible,0
its time to stop treating these people like they have any honor decency or redeeming qualities they dont,0
we expect more from our leaders and if if they have no class and character they should be exposed,0
good for obama tired of republican slandering games,0
trump and adonis are the last two words i would have expected to hear in a sentence even today i agree with the first statement saying biden could defend himself but i dont think everyone would look at the email and see it as a sermon setting someone straight and telling them what they did was unexpected and improper isnt a sermon its giving them a wakeup call also yes no physician should ever pass judgement like that without examining a person first its not rude its unprofessional he basically flaunted his status as a dr to troll inb trump tweets bi im fabulous,0
i disagree with david i admire obama for speaking out the truth thats rare these days im from uk and sadly see the same kind of politics here immoral and discussing,0
ron don livin the con,2
damn obama went with the im not mad but im hella disappointed approach,0
doesnt jacksons response sound exactly like trump wrote it,0
obama speaking out more please,2
the one he aced,2
the government is not gonna lie cnn contributor,1
so wait if your property gets raided its weird and questionable to be the first person to talk about it wtf is wrong with these people,0
i wasnt even planning on voting this midterms this woke everyone up,0
the world is laughing at us as we slowly split our country apart these people have abused there power for too long now,0
i am embarrassed for my fathers country i would like to apologize to every soldier who ever died under our flag i wish i could give you your life back because it was in vain,0
if this actually does end up getting trump reelected in the future i will laugh harder than i ever have,0
i m somewhere in the middle and with the way the economy is all the denial from biden this just broke my trust in the government i can t trust them at all from this point on period,0
it s very rare that something like this would ever happen to a former president in fact this is a first,0
this is the government our founding fathers warned us about,0
sooo gullible the government is not going to lie,0
i hate when they say were a nation of laws the law is written interpreted and enforced differently for different people,0
shout out to casey hunt her interviewing skills here were very direct and substantive she goes on and on in round table discussionsshe should hone them tighter as she did in the interview,2
liz cheney you are loved and admired a role model for the country both dems and reps you are a special human being smart and strong god bless you,2
when are we as a nation going back to sincere governance elections are partisan by nature but governing is not supposed to be encumbants are tasked to address all the needs of all the citizenry the job of leadership should never be to retard the nations progress when their party doesnt hold the majority the lies and the one upmanship has got to stop the victory should be seen as the nations rather than just one party or the other it is the job of all who are serving to facilitate our progress we are so much better than what we have been doing we may have fallen short of our ideal but we should never stop striving we are guaranteed not to make it if we quit,0
i obejct to her saying pence was a hero not because i dont think he did the right thing but rather he had no legal alternative this is like saying pence is a hero for not committing burglary today,0
shes given her career to prove the truth justice department needs to live up to their name,1
she has plenty of time to get her concession speech ready because she can see the train coming,1
thanks to the whole committee and a special thanks to the two republicans who are serving at great personal losses true heroes these people have served to work towards a real democracy,2
i think its always been understood that the rich and powerful are above the law they either can afford good atterneys lobby to have the laws changed in their or know the right people to make things go away this would be a good chance to take a step toward being a country where no one is above the law to send the signal that enough is enough no one is above the law,1
i just need votesguilty,0
thank you melissa its not the chemistry but the math that is rough,2
i would like to say thank you so much for teaching us chemistry here on youtube i got an a grade in one of my chemistry class and i am so happy because i was able to understand the topics with the help your videos,2
taking ap chemistry this upcoming school year and this channel will definitely be my goto please keep with the awesome videos,2
youre so cool i really look up to you because youre so smart i really wanted to learn stoichiometry but i couldnt and i had trouble picking it up but thanks to you i have easily learned it i love the style of your videos and their vibe thank you for putting in so much work for us i love you,2
thank you so much mam for making chemistry things more easy for everyone your work is excellent,2
just when i thought i failed chemistry i got an a thanks to your videos,2
this is a great resource for study review and teaching thank you so much for this and for your channel,2
cant thank youfor all these videos it helped me get out of my fear of chemistry,2
you know you helped me out last year with organic chemistry thanks and if i do take chemistry in the future ill watch you vids for sure,2
my daughter will be starting her th grade chem section next week i told her that i used your videos to get me through my chemistry for health sciences course in college yeah i started late which was a brutal combination of gen bio and organic chem classes youre getting your next generation thanks for the help,2
i love how you actually explain stuff instead of just shoving information into students heads i think that turns many students off about learning chemistry since theyre not understanding any of it and are just blindly memorising and accepting that things happen the way they do without aksing why if those students had you as a teacher theyd be a much more interested in chemistry as theyll understand that its how we as a species study matter and the universe and is not just a bunch of stuff to be memorised keep going youre amazing,2
sir as an older woman who found chemistry to be impossible when i was at school i thank you for this,2
i appreciate this im a biology major about to take chemistry in the fall but i feel like i havent truly grasped my first chemistry class yet,1
this lesson made me excited to dive into chemistry im just learning it for the sake of knowing how the world works cant wait for the next lesson,2
i recently fumbled through a biochemistry course it was quite difficult for me since i had completely forgotten the fundamentals of general chemistry looking forward to working backwards with you crawling after my walking even just this st lesson has cleared up a lot of things that i had just memorized for biochemistry can t wait for next lesson please keep making these videos you are a very talented teacher,2
the best chemistry lesson l have ever had much appreciated from zimbabwe,2
excellent teacher full of goodwill and skill,2
ive past this level already but thanks to you ive gain new perspective thanks,2
this was absolutely amazing thank you so much for sharing your valuable knowledge,2
wow that was a great explanation i feel like i understand why some molecules are polar and others are not also at the end you mentioned that protons and electrons are actually waves that got my attention i m looking forward to your explanation i hope you continue the series on chemistry thanks,2

mr organic chemistry tutor thank you for powerful introduction to the old greek alphabet list and their usage in science and engineering,2
thank you so much easier then looking them up individually,2
sir if you can make it as a pdf format it will useful for the students for their reference,2
sir if you write a definition of all the terminalogy that has used in the topic it will be very helpful for all of us,2
i have really fallen in love with physics,2
i was trying to list them the other day thank you sir,2
this is an interesting video this is like a math version of the alphabet can you do the putnam problems,2
,1
im greek and i approve of this just work on your gamma is like this small capital,2
can we appreciate that this video is about years and still saving lives,2
youve taught me more in minutes than my chemistry teacher in a whole year,2
i need him as my teacher he looks like hes enjoying this and not doing it just for money,2
i just wanted to say your videos have gotten me through half of my chem class so far the only test i did bad on was the one where i had to memorize polyatomic ions just couldnt remember them all i sincerely appreciate you putting your knowledge on this youtube channel i found you back a few months ago when i first started my class because i was so frustrated and went to youtube and i happened to find you i dont understand why teachers dont explain things the way you do you show us every step while other teachers skip steps and go way too fast it makes me feel better about myself because i failed chem class in high school but have to take it in college to become a nurse youre beyond helpful and are impacting students in so many ways ill keep using as many of your videos as i can as i make my way through my chem class youre amazing,2
you are literally the person who saved me from failing in chemistry our end of term is just a few days from now thank you sir,2
i love how he even explains assumed or common mistakes we can t even ask him face to face but it s like he read our minds and he s explaining things i wouldn t understand in real life thank you so much,2
renewed confidence that i can get through all this chemistry i have to take to be a biologist thank you sir,2
this was so helpful in minutes ive learned more than i did in two years,2
i havent found anyone explain balancing equations as patient and simple as youso easy to understand ace,2
you didnt balance any equations tyler youve balanced my life,1
im a years old mama and here im trying to learn more on mothers day i need to be able to help my youngest daughternever is too old to learn and help others thank you,2
i am not even in high school or junior high and i am learning this this person behind the screen teaching is so awesome he makes it so easy to understand everything and explains words and phrases i really hope to learn more from him,2
i am a retired accountant and love math i appreciate all of your videos on every subjects you made learning fun and easy if i have these videos back in my college days i could have done a lot better in my grades and career i am planning to watch all of your videos for reviewing and sharpening up my skills in maths you are a genius thank you,2
im in th grade trying to learn more and more about algebra at the moment so im ahead of my class and prepared thank you so much for making this i am sure this will help me a lot in the future and i even made notecards so i can practice and remember everything you taught me i really appreciate your help and my goal is to learn calculus before i am taught it,2
havent had algebra in years this was so helpful,2
you just covered everything i learned in my th grade year in an hour,1
hey im and going back to school after many years im working on my masters degree but ive completely forgotten the rules of algebra so dropping in for a refresher thanks,2
im learning this in grade hoping to boost my knowledge of algebra besides this it can also help me with coding and python great tutorial,2
oh my gosh the amount of effort and sincerity you ve put into this lengthy tutorial is remarkable i truly cannot thank you enough i was feeling anxious knowing i d be put into an algebra l honors class next year it s due to this video that i may be able to be confident in my algebraic knowledge i fear,2
i m extremely far behind on my classes and your teaching me more then my teachers have so far,0
this is my definition of a teacher he shows so much passion in his teaching and its simplified for me to understand,2
timestamps introduction what is chemistry what is an atom what is a molecule what is a chemical reaction what is an element what is a compound what is a mixture what is a homogeneous mixture what is a heterogeneous mixture end,1
its confirmed the only reason i hated chemistry untill now was because my teachers werent good enough hes so dedicated in what hes doing earned my respect,0
i m and watching this in because i never took a chemistry class in high school or college thank you so much for making it so easy to understand can t wait to watch the rest of your videos,2
he had posted k lectures so far woaw thank you very much for these so much respect for your passion in teaching sir youre totally going to be my online teacher this quarantine,2
my teachers should be more like this guy sometimes i wish teachers could separate their egos from their ability to teach,1
im going into th grade and i want to make sure that i get a head start on chemistry this made everything so much clearer and better,2
this is my definition of a teacher he shows so much passion in his teaching and its simplified for me to understand thanks a lot for your great efort in educating needy,2
i am fourteen and want to become a scientist and you are helping me achieve my dream thank you,2
it cannot be overstated how helpful this very stepbystep approach in teaching is,2
i got a on my first calc test and it was supposed to be the easiest of the exams so i was worried i wouldn t pass the class i then started to watch this guy s videos on every lesson we covered and now finished the class with an a,2
sir as far as calculus goes both differential and integral this is by far your best video this clip helped me immensely in regards to being able to verbally express the purpose of each of the branches of calculus again very well done,2
ok now calculus in minutes,1
learn calculus in minutes me within minute googling what is a function,1
excellent work you are giving knowledge free to everyone you certainly accumulates lot of good karma may triple gem bless you for everything keep it up,2
i had to comment under this video i have my bs in math and when i tell you the way you taught these concepts were absolutely amazing you did a great job in not only explaining the concepts but setting it up to where one can intuit all the components and and concepts that goes into the applications of it all thanks so much i feel like i can really help my students with their digestion of these concepts and rationalization of it thanks you so much for taking the time to teach these concepts,2
dude keep up the great work i owe a large part of my undergrad success to you and you are still making boss videos and improving your lessons thank you very much,2
youre a very good teacher stepbystep each new point building on all the previous ones this was a good review and general practice of calculus many thanks,2
the point that he makes at around is so critical i wish my university prof that would have taught us things like that from the beginning big thanks to you i am not sure where i would be in my undergrad without you,2
this video understand calculus in minutes me taking calculus for the th time,1
biology the only science where multiplication and division mean the same thing,1
may the mass times acceleration be with you this really struck me,2
this song is the sole reason i chose chemistry for a senior subject please pray for me,2
physics cool guy chemistry crazy guy biology kind guy maths serious guy,2
i love how literally everyone agrees that math is the villain,2
i would make a joke about gravity but noone would fall for that,0
i love physics but it makes me question everything and i have had multiple nights where i was deeply disturbed by it,0
i was in tears at the keep your ion me ill get you charged line the wordplay i love it,2
my science teacher had us watch this in class she s known throughout the school as the cool teacher,2
omg this is a pure masterpiece biology is the part that got me shivers the most even though its the only among the four that im not studying right now,0
hey my hero bear in mind you are helping students who are in somalia where there is no functional government and also cant get a great teachers like you but when i see people like you helping me and my classmates without money that really reminds us that we still have great heroes giving us a bright future thank you my hero,2
guys he has a patreon and a go fund me page in the discription lets all donate to this legend for helping us i would be failing my classes if it wasnt for him,2
i just want to take the time and appreciate how your background is black and not white it s so much nicer for the eyes,2
wow he just covered a semesters worth of material in just three hour,2
i am a chem teacher and am relying on your videos during covid your site is the only one i have found to explain the material the way i do with the same depth of content and accurate thanks you for helping me and my students make this transition to online distance learning smooth and mostly painless in addition since i have found you to be such an excellent instructor and parents and kids clash at times i have you teach my year old nd grade multiplying and dividing fractions i then act as his tutor to explain concepts such as negative numbers that you introduce and clear up his confusion i find it works out so much better this way because when i am both teacher and tutor to him his frustration level rises rapidly when he does not grasp a concept immediately,2
the dislikes are the teachers who just got outclassed,0
there is nothing this channel doesnt have i studied for ap calculus ap physics c mech and electronics and now for my university chem placement test with this channel and i have no idea how to thank you for this you are literally saving lives with your videos i cant be more greatful for anything than your videos thank you so so so much,2
u deserve a standing ovation for teaching students in such a nice way,2
i can proudly say that ive gone through the whole video i started in april th and with larger breaks due to final exams in school i finished today on the th of may i have learned so much important stuff i will go to university for a bachelors degree in biology yet i havent had chemistry and physics in over years going through this content and studying it carefully is probably the only reason i feel comfortable to continue my journey to become a neuroscientist thanks,2
dear organic chemistry tutor i am preparing for biology and chemistry exams after not taking these classes for years and i dont think anybody could explain this content more clear and organised thank you so much for taking the time and potentially changing the lives and futures of thousands if not millions of kids that follow your account,2
i learned more in minutes than in like class periods,2
thank you for doing what my chemistry teacher didn t,2
who else is here because learning over zoom teaches you nothing,0
if teachers in schools and professors in colleges were like this guy we would see flying cars and buses since,1
outta all the videos ive watched about significant figures this is the only one that made me understand significant figures,2
i am a taiwanese chem teacher and i really need to give big applause to you,2
sir i have no words to describe your teaching i am speechless thanks a lot sir it will help me in my neet exam thank you so much sir from bottom of my heart,2
this helped me so much my chem proffesor assigned a sig fig assignment with giving no context or review so i am very happy i came across your video thank you,2
you are a great teacher you have gotten me through nursing math and now you re getting me through chemistry thank you so much,2
thank you so much youre a life saver my textbook is too complicated but you make it so easy to understand and comprehend,2
mathematician we have to analyze everything through with logic so that we know how to apply it physicist lets poke it and see what happens,1
mathematician you cant divide by physicist it will cancel out with another infinity later on,1
mathematicians lets prove this physicists lets use the results,1
this is just like having a philosophy student in a law or politics class,0
when faced with a problem mathematician i cannot prove im stuck physicist i solved it but it only applies to spherical chickens in vacuum engineer let me show you how is done,1
physicist in mathematicians class makes fun of physicists lack of rigor mathematician in physicists class makes fun of physicists lack of rigor,1
programmer is there an algorithm to solve this more efficiently,1
an engineer a physicist and a mathematician traveling in wales for the first time notice a black sheep engineer oh sheep in wales are black physicist oh there exists black sheep in wales mathematician oh there exists at least one sheep in wales and at least one side of it is black,1
i just love coming back to these videos like twice a semester and understanding the jokes a little bit more each time,2
once on a tv show a mathematician and a physician were invited and were to make a fence all over some sheeps using the less material possible the physician starts and put all the sheeps in a circle and try to make the fence less and less big then its the mathematician turn he makes a fence all over him and define himself as the outside making the sheeps on the inside of the fence moral theres none its just funny stop overthinking,1
lady destroyed racisms years ago respect,0
wow she is so young,2
the funny thing is every single item on the map could probably have a fullscale map of its own,2
nice illustrations,2
math was still is and forever will be one of my favourite subjects to study i feel in love with both its simplicity and complexity the way it never makes sense when you go through it but at the end everything fits together with such ease to form an answer some of the best memories of my school days were formed in the math class and everytime i come back to it it astounds me all over again i feel extremely privileged and lucky to be able to enjoy such a wonderful subject and i hope our education system can improve enough to spark interest in more and more students,2
im only in high school but i love this map cause it makes me feel like i am in a video game upgrading my skill tree with experience points lol i am going into something math related in life no idea what yet but i find it absolutely fascinating,2
brilliant i now know what it is that i so love about mathematics in a nutshell i would have loved to have had this insight when i was teaching maths for years some of my pupils got it and many went on to study maths in some form and have had successful careers including professorships at id like to believe that kids will always remain curious about the mathematical world,2
just realized my current math skills are at the same level as those in bce,1
i love it and i agree with what he said in the end i became interested in mathematics although not good at it because of how amazing that when you solve numbers and equations you will arrive to an answer that is related to what the universe offers,2
maths is love thx for the insight bro very informative,2
ive been watching this video since the start of my journey i come back here maybe once a year it feels so good to have covered up some parts of this map a dream i had when first seeing this,2
this helped me so much my friend who is a genius when it comes to school education and he used this to get a basic foundation of where i am so we know where to start thanks so much you gained another sub keep up the great work i know it s a lot of work but i would love to make a very in depth video one for each of the subjects you mentioned in this video,2
the best im understanding your online explanations more than my teachers at schooli recommended your channel to my friends and theyre agreeing with me thanks a ton,2
this video helped me to learn this lesson easily before the schools reopen thank you so much sir,2
thanks a lot sir this video helped a lot to understand the balancing concepts,2
amazing teaching sir i wish i had a teacher like you in my school,2
awesomely explainedthanks a tonno words to express our gratitude for such wonderful explanation,2
the world needs so much more of the likes of you sir i am lost for words to thank you your enunciation is great and your explanation is remarkable,2
thanks sir its really understandable i enjoyed it,2
thank you sir you elaborated the topic well easy to understand indeed,2
i have been trying these equations for mobths you helped me out thanks alotttt sir may god bless you,2
thanks a lot sir actually i never understand that how to make equations and how to balanced them and in online classes everything is like going upwards from my head your video motivate me and give me an inspiration that chemistry is really not tough again thanks a lot for such a wonderful video keep going keep growing,2
great video,2
the topic in x minutes format seems fun what topic would you want to see in the future,2
that s way faster than any teacher could ever hope to achieve,2
the dna joke at the beggining i actually laughed exactly like the audience i started chuckling then more and then i bursted out laughing it was perfect,2
who said my man ai cant reproduce just do simple steps ctrl c ctrl v boom ai,1
son mom can i attend a biology class mom we have a biology class at home biology class at home,1
in just minutes and seconds i learned more than hours of school,2
fungi are like the weird cousin of plants and animals ah yes that weird cousin who has a habit of feeding off their relatives corpses once theyve died,0
i thought all of the comment section would be like mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,1
next quantum physics in a planck second,1
man i thought he was gonna explain all my years of medical studies in min he didnt even touch the atom of the galaxy,0
haven t been to school in ten years and just reenrolled in college i need all the help i can get thanks for the video its a good warm up lecture before i take my actual bio class,2
dude thank you so much for providing this information for free on youtube im not a biology student amateur nor do i have anything to do with it career wise but i just like to have knowledge and i watch your videos multiple times and i still do its people like you and sal khan from khan academy that make this world a better place i can learn anything i want without going broke lol thanks once again,2
this dude is a very talented teacher you can feel his enthusiasm through his words and his teaching is very easy to learn from i find its rare to find,2
wow i think i just learned more here than in my actual bio class,2
just want to say that your videos helped me get an a in my college bio class in the past thank you,2
this is an excellent lesson and i love how the teacher explains it so it is easy and fun to learn,2
hes an awesome teacher he explains very well,2
sir thank you very much for posting this i have learned a lot just by watching your video i also took the important details on my notes so that i can review it you are such an amazing professor just like my biology prof when i was in grade who can explain everything in detailed and examples by the way i am from the philippines and i am having a college entrance exam this may thank you again sir for the series of video youve made for biology i am currently watching them,2
wow never listened to a lecture where time felt like it went too fast thank you,2
thanks to sir because he teach lessons about biology and its pretty good because i incoming freshman this years bs biology this is helpful to all students like me,2
biology is one of those subjects which needs to be taught visually to provide clear understanding,1
this video is educational art its much more stimulating than my physiology teachers monotone powerpoint lectures thank you so much,2
weeks of online class radically explained in minutes thank you so much,2
this video was incredibly helpful for me a video of minutes literally covered the whole chapter of cell thanks a million,2
incredibly helpful thank you so much this is how we should learn biology,2
it proves that everything is interesting if it is taught in the right way,2
description imagery perfection no really this is a perfect review for my organelles test for tomorrow great job and thank you so much edit wow i did not expect this so many likes hehethx,2
dude i cant thank you enough this is the first time i have understood anything about cell and found it interesting this is literally a game changer thanks a lott,2
while i do enjoy my college biology class having this information in a visual format like this gave all that abstract lecture information something to stick to thank you so much,2
how is one guy so good at teaching so many subjects,1
i wish my professor explained the material how you did i feel like i m actually retaining the information,1
dont be too hard on yourself about the drawing you presented it really did help me understand things a lot better and thank you for the video you are so clear and concise you are helping me a lot,2
no problem my guy whats important is how you teach fantastic work i really loved it how you explained every single detail keep up the great job,2
your video is far more effective than my bio teachers whole year lecture,2
oh man there he goes smacking open the biology can at this rate he will have his own school soon keep it up,2
thank you so much sir i appreciate your hardwork for the sake of many students having a hard time to understand their subjects especially physics chemistry mathematics biology and etc may god bless you and your family,2
thank you so much for all of your help with everything i am taking biochemistry and genetics right now praying to find more videos that you can help me out with these classes love the way you teach,2
thanks you really helped me form a background understanding of cells and made me prepare for my upcoming biology class,2
this guy really helps me through my med classes im glad i bumped into your videos you make complex topics so easy to understand,2
thank you so much to those that were able to join us on this videos premiere please expand the video details or this comment to see a helpful table of contents and information about a video companion handout to further help with studying also this is the longest video we will likely ever make d even after all the proofing we may find a typo or a needed clarification well put it in this pinned comment if so timestamped table of contents click on the time stamps to access that part of the video also the numbers on the left of the topics correspond to the grid box on our video companion which is linked on our website to find the video companion scroll down to the topic review alphabetically listed on characteristics of life levels of organization biomolecules enzymes prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells and intro to cells inside the cell membrane and cell transport osmosis cellular respiration photosynthesis and fermentation dna intro to heredity dna replication cell cycle mitosis meiosis alleles and genes genetics including monohybrid dihybrid sexlinked traits multiple alleles incomplete dominance codominance and pedigrees protein synthesis mutations natural selection and genetic drift bacteria viruses classification and protists fungi plant structure plant reproduction in angiosperms food chains food webs ecological succession carbon nitrogen cycle ecological relationships human body system functions overview,2
whos here studying and cramming the day before their biology staar me,1
using this to study for my bio eoc tomorrow,2
y all came in clutch for my eoc tomorrow edit i got a thanks amoeba sisters,2
yo freshman girl here i take the biology eoc tomorrow i wish everybody luck i just graduated may th class of upcoming freshmen you got this,2
could you please do some more live videos in the future also i appreciate that petunia worked hard to draw minutes of pictures and animations to help us students study for tests,2
three years later and y all still saving students with this video i got a staar tomorrow and literally learned nothing in class thank you guys so much,2
the art for these are so good i really appreciate the effort,2
people are excited for the game of thrones premiere and i m excited for the amoeba sisters a scroll through biology premiere lol,2
my test is on the th of next week this year hasn t been the best for me and i have struggled with learning i ll let you guys know if i have passed or not edit hi everyone i know i m super late but long story short i passed this eoc review was definitely worth watching,2
biology made ridiculously easy st edition digital book,2
just started watching today everything seem so clear now looking forward to other videos,2
thank you for helping beginners understand science god bless,2
keep going guys you are doing an awesome job,2
very brief and interesting video i shall share it with my students look forward to watching more videos like this,2
i like how this video is narrieted its more engaginggreat work,2
awesome understanding explanation of biology,2
nice video can you let me know which tool did you use to make this great video thanks,2
a virus interacts with its environment uses energy and reproduces but viruses are argued to be not living organisms maybe this is because they cant independently reproduce they require the cellular machinery of the host cell to manufacture new viruses,0
love it i fell in love with all videos,2
if you liked the video and want to see more like this here are some things you can do to make sure it happens share the video check out nebula curiosity stream like and comment,2
having done a lot of diving i can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter some mostly the younger ones are so curious at first its like wow u threat once it establishes that you are not its like eeer what are you then ive never seen one of you around before and there begins the act of mutual curiosity you slowly reach with a finger it sends a tentacle you both touch sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand flashing black before letting go but not swimming away they are playful find a shiny pebble hand it to the octopus itll take it check if it can be eaten discard it then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to why did he give me this pebble gotta check again for anything special they really hold a very special place in my heart its not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding,2
i worked with a marine biologist studying cephalopods he had one big tank for octopuses and one for crabs their favorite food one morning he came in and found that one of his octopuses had pushed the lid open on his tank crossed the floor and climbed into the crab tank soon it became a common occurrence he decided to give the octopus a mild shock when he found it in the crab tank to deter it within days he came in and found the octopus had still gone to the crab tank eaten its fill but then climbed back to its own tank to avoid the shock they are amazing animals,1
my favorite creature ever i was on a crab ship in russia i was the green horn so i had to empty out the pots i was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden it was lighting in a cup so i could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals one day there was an octopus in a crab pot i tossed it a live well came back once everyone was off the deck was gonna take it to the chef it softly wrapped itself around my arm and i felt like i could see the fear in its eyes i couldnt do it i took it over to the side of the ship held it over it looked down looked back at me let go of my arm and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water amazing creatures,2
i think cephalopod intelligence is hard wired an octopus has a very short lifespan as little as months and has to learn everything from the moment it hatches completely on its own its mother died before it emerged from the egg so it is born an orphan this has huge implications because despite being intelligent it has no mentor to learn from it s also a mollusk so in a way it s a slug with awesome superpowers they re fascinating animals,1
i can genuinely say i have never been more astounded by another being on this planet the evolution of this beautiful creature is literally out of this world this video left such an imprint on me that being able to pet play handle or be in close graces of this animal are on my lifes bucketlist for sure being apart of research and doing a degree career change may be in my future,2
i gotta go to work in hours and im over here learning about octopuses at am,1
you know in our hunt for intelligent life in space its heartwarming and humbling to know there are other creatures on this planet other than humans who very well in the distant future could eventually be seen as a higher intelligence,2
one of the most amazing species of octopus is the mimic octopus it not only uses its shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators when being chased by a damselfish itll make itself look like a banded sea snake which is a damsel fish predator but also to hunt imitating a crab to draw in another crab the list of animals its been observed to imitate is quite long jelly fish lionfish sea snakes zebra sole flatfish giant crab sea horses ect it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we dont know about the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals,2
i feel that this is a great place to recommend the book children of ruin it depicts a society of octopuses that were subject to a virus which causes accelerated evolution and the struggle of humans to communicate with them some of the best scifi ive read,2
want to see more from thor,1
i love how wired always finds people that are super passionate about their careers always the icing on the cake for me,2
i love this guy hes so charismatic has wonderful speech patterns and explains things so well,2
as a biology major this video made me feel sad for not having great professionals as passionate to their jobs as this man,0
his enthusiasm is so contagious and he makes biology sound so interesting this was awesome thank you wired,2
i love the way he talks with such enthusiasm but in a calm way that s inviting and makes you want to learn,2
this man brought half of his office with him just to show us the most details so humble and kind,2
this guy is so fascinating i love him he s so passionate about what he teaches and i love it i m sure his students are so grateful for him he showed us so much cool stuff,2
thor used to give talks at my tiny little elementary school in the pnw genuinely one of the smartest and most passionate people i have ever met in my life and yes he brought this many props for presentations too,2
this dude needs a podcast his voice is calming and intellectual at the same time,2
level explaining level deeper explaining level conversation level discussion level interview,1
im allergic to penicillin and azithromycin round of applause for the parents,0
people i just don t think people should be able to use it for cosmetic purposes scientists bold of you to assume we know how to do that,0
level my knowledge before a test level what my classmates are discussing before a test,1
his body language says a lot about him hes very ambitious willing to share and learn more but also hes really competitive,2
do you know what crispr is me yes i believe every potato chip could be crispr,1
i love how she just drops the p protein knowledge out there all the sudden definitely subverted the expectations of a lot of viewers there i bet,1
level what is crispr level what is crispr level ethics level ethics level dinos,1
if you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough albert einstein,1
level he teaches level he teaches a little bit deeper level he has a basic conversation but he knows a little more level they both know about the same and have a back and forth discussion level he gets taught by the interviewee,1
hello youtubers the world science festival is looking for enthusiastic translation ambassadors for its youtube translation project to get started all you need is a google account check out quantum biology the hidden nature of nature to see how the process works to create your translation just type along with the video and save when done check out the full list of programs that you can contribute to here the world science festival strives to cultivate a general public thats informed and awed by science thanks to your contributions we can continue to share the wonder of scientific discoveries with the world,2
the number of times ive heard we dont know and partially understood gives me hope for science,2
this is amazing and really interesting i got so lost because i have insufficient scientific education to follow this completely but it is fascinating to me and i really enjoyed this video i have saved it and will play it over and over again to try and understand it i love the humor and the very clear way they are trying to explain this to the layman it is wonderful that they have this on youtube so we can all explore this amazing subject,2
i just want to say that i absolutely love this im both mindblown entertained and inspired as a mere psych student i still feel like i understood a whole lot of it and they even made some psych references and the way they talked about children having an intuitive understanding of quantum stuff made me think of theorytheory and this quote its not that children are little scientists its that scientists are big children,2
this was a phenomenally moderated session serious kudos to john,2
i am very thankful for this presentation i was afraid i was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move in a since chemically that would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light in effect just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving its structure idle at its point of origin but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parents original quality in this accomplishing the quantum speeds said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction as well as color change we see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic plant cells great discussion,2
i just started enjoying watching this with closed captioning but minutes in it stopped working i hope this can be fixed so i can watch the whole segment absolutely loved what was mentioned already so far thank you all for putting this together,2
i wonder if some of these systems could be studied in the two organisms i know of that go into a frozen stasis during winter perhaps as the thaw begins to occur some of the bio quantum mechanical features could be observed and measured,1
thank you so much for this video very helpful for a biology teacher like me,2
take note at the assertion is made that cellular biology especially how dna directs construction of its copy during mitosis is incredibly complex this should answer my critics who say im overstating the facts when i refer to dna as a d molecule it functions like a computer program or at least like a program controller within a cell,1
i remember being only able to see content like this on the discovery channel its crazy that i can watch content like this arguably waaay better at anytime and not being glued to my tv brilliant,2
i use to be in the army i can remember in training the endless patrols through the woods but the dragonflies were our friends you d see them gliding back and forth just over our heads catching the mosquitoes which swarmed around us it was impossible for the dragonflies to get all the mosquitoes but it was a comfort to know we had allies out there in those woods,2
i once was kayaking with my father in florida when i took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore about seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off after it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder i had just witnessed that day i learned that dragon flies are metal as fuck,0
that was probably one of the more intelligent clicks ive chosen in a while thank you for sharing and creating that incredible video now i absolutely have an even deeper appreciation for dragonflies than i already did,2
i once found a cold dragonfly who couldnt move i put it into diret sunlight and it warmed and flew away im glad to have been of help,2
this was one of the best documentaries i ve ever seen perfect organization perfect visuals extremely high information content well done and thank you,2
when i was growing up in the countryside in japan dragonflies were everywhere i could catch them with my fingers sometimes of course i let them go quickly but some of the kids put thread on them so they wouldnt fly away those were the days now i dont see many dragonflies anymore thank you so much for sharing the wonderful fact about them,2
ive seen a dragon fly with wings once i was floating down a river and it was flying near me and then landed on me for a short time all of the wings worked a cool mutation i wonder how rare it is wish i had a camera with me,2
what intelligence to be able to skillfully control those beautiful wings about years ago my husband and i stopped by a large creek to meditate as i opened my eyes a group of five dragonflies that were traveling over the water suddenly stopped in front of my face hovered there for about seconds then suddenly did a degree turn in synchronized fashion and continued on their way down the creek it was otherworldly i ll never forget it thank you for this excellent content,2
the counterbalance to deal with aerodynamic flutter is some really incredible biomechanics ive seen videos of flutter being tested on airplanes and its no joke that can quickly ruin your day,0
read the articles in full at quanta,1
with the current acceleration of breakthroughs in science i wish this was like a monthly thing it would be awesome to get updated by these great videos,2
truly interesting to learn that sleep isnt restricted to organisms with a brain,2
neuroscience the way we percieve the functions of the brain botany the death flower sleep new discoveries,1
quanta magazine always does a brilliant job at condensing scientific discoveries for a wider audience i love what you do,2
i usually hold popsci in disdain but this series is an exception actually communicating the discoveries in a way that is suited to those who are scientifically literate but not experts in the field and not exaggeratingmystifying things for the sake of clickbait,1
regarding sleep and metabolism theres already good evidence of that being the case with various endocrine functions related to metabolism being affected by sleep disorders like sleep apnea and narcolepsy the functional systems model of the brain has also been an emerging conceptualization for a while now and loosely touches on the artificial distinction between neurology and psychiatry,1
i was waiting for this this blew my mind gotta wait for the physics and math one there are so much to tell great work,2
i ve been keeping my eyes on my subscriptions just in case quanta magazine posts this year s science break through and it s finally here great episode as usual i m also excited for the maths and physics ones and thank you quanta magazine for your great work,2
i just completed my first year if psychology and neuroscience at university scientists are learning new things about the brain all the time it s super cool,2
and if you haven t had enough ocean creature facts for one day head over to listen to our new podcast episode deciphering the mind of the octopus on nebula it will take you behind the scenes on what it s like to take care of these mischievous animals this is probably my favorite episode yet,2
the existence of hammerhead sharks implies there exists a nail fish somewhere out there to be discovered,1
the most fearsome predator of the sea sharks the orca literally torturing other animals for fun am i a joke to you,0
that footage of the finless shark plummeting to the sea floor was appalling im incredibly glad you showed it but its appalling im not outright against the killing of animals but the combination of outright cruelty and waste is just mind bending i struggle with how humans can so easily disconnect from certain realities i struggle with how i see it in myself as well a fisherman would know that these sharks would still be alive when theyre thrown back in if they just stopped to even think about what theyre doing if theyre hellbent on wasting the rest of the shark just slit the damn things throat before you throw it back you sick fuck,0
it s really interesting to think about how an animal that has been around for literally million of years just out of the blue made a species so different from the rest and out of the ordinary yet it ended up being very complex and enhanced from the norm,2
awesome work love the video thank you for what you do,2
sharks have survived all mass extinctions prime suspects i would say,1
hammerheads are amazing years ago while trolling off the coast of florida i encountered one i was headed due south and we spotted it heading aproximately se fin out the surface big fella but we were on an intercept course he came to within ft of the boat then turned off to the west he circled around well behind our baits and resumed his original course i swear he had gps,2
your speech at the end of this video really struck me it makes me so happy to hear someone able to take their dream and make it a reality both your channel and real engineering are two of my favorites for interesting and niche technology and science and i am always excited to see a new video thank you for being you and sharing what you care about to the rest of the world,2
the technical side of this video and this channel is truly impressive have to admit the fact they are providing free useful scientific information with such a great quality a very big thanks for the people behind this channel,2
check out even more from thor,2
every time he answers its like hes telling us a story rather than regurgitating an answer i could listen to him all day,2
give this guy his own animal documentary series like a more chill bill nye his explanations are like a little story and you dont make anyone feel bad about their questions bravo this was one of the most entertaining biology videos i have watched in awhile,2
came for the biology facts stayed for his infectious positivity his energy alone is more of a dopamine hit than anything else has been all day,2
how on earth does wired get the professionals who are literally the most passionate people on the planet,0
he seems very passionate about biology the way that he explains these things makes it seem like he really loves his job i admire people who can be passionate about their jobs,2
not only is he crazy passionate and knowledgeable about biology hes also called thor how much cooler can this guy get,2
the plant is deadly deadly toxic d lmao i love this guy his enthusiasm is contagious keep bringing him back,2
my favorite example of weird evolution is the aldabra rail a small flightless bird that lived on a single island and went extinct when the island sunk later when sea levels dropped its ancestor migrated back to the island and reevolved into the same species,1
he is the type of biology teacher that would be able to easily hold the attention of any classe just by the way he speaks so excited about things,2
as someone obsessed with biology im pretty disappointed that the map of biology received the least views of all the sciences,0
ive been waiting forever for this one although im biased by being a biochemist myself he did an amazing job at bringing all the branches together in a smooth nonconfusing way i would like to see a map of medicine or linguistics in the future,2
awesome job with this maps and all the others too which will be the next map map of philosophy map of engineering map of psychology,2
this is helping me understand what parts of biology i like and therefore helping me choose my education thank you for a very informational video,2
the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,1
i love your maps they are fantastic thank you for putting them together they are super helpful one nitpick what about microbiology this is a very important subject given that unicellular microorganisms vastly outnumber the multicellular organisms most people are familiar with of course i may be biased since i am a microbiologistanyway keep up the great work i am blown away by the breadth of your knowledge and have learned a ton about scientific fields i am less familiar with through your work,2
love the kurzgesagt reference at can you do the map of astronomy next,2
i love these maps so much they are pure gold philosophy i imagine is very tough to make but would be extremly awesome too,2
you mentioned that bioinformatics is the field that uses computers to analyze genetic data when statistical methods arent enough but when statistical methods are enough that is a field called quantitative genetics and using it we can often tell whether a trait is genetic without having to know which specific genes are involved it can also help give candidates for molecular genetic study to find the genes relating to those traits,1
these videos are good but i have two minor criticisms of this one structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the wikipedia page on structural biology but i dont think thats correct biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology but the latter two fields arent closely related to the first,0
this dude is getting me through college one video at a time,2
table of contents nucleic acids dna a polymers b three ingredients c base pairs d base sequences pop quiz rna a three differences from dna biolography replication a helicase and unzipping b leading strand c dna polymerase d rna primase e lagging strand f okazaki fragments f dna ligase,1
my earphones get tangled all the time but miles and miles of dna dont mind blowing,0
i started teaching biology in and i know my kids now middle aged know it was rosalind franklin who did the work hank thank you i left teaching but am thinking about getting back into the classroom using your videos to study up for the test to get recertified,2
thank you so much for covering rosalind franklin some of my previous instructors only briefly mention her and they rarely discuss her major contributions to the discovery of the dna structure,2
the funny part about biology is that everyone pronounces everything differently,1
why is a teenage boy similar to helicase they both want to unzip your genes grins im speechless,0
i dont remember crash course being this complicated when i was in th grade biology though i guess i should be thankful that years later it is still helpful for my college level genetics class,2
editing team hank please hold up a shoelace and be amazed by it,2
for the first time in my two years in college i actually understand what i am seeing thank you i am in the mlt program trying to understand how pcr testing works but in order to do that i realized that i really need to comprehend dna and how it is made in order to understand how it is taken apart and analyzed you have really given me a strong visual and i cant thank you enough,2
lectures hit different when you re not pressured by grades,1
honestly its crazy how much easier information is retained when you voluntarily seek it when i was in school i would have never listened to this and would have been dying to get out of there now that i have the ability to learn on my own time i retain and look for information on a much higher level incredible,2
this professor is wonderful i ve been in a lot of lectures and the way he immediately captured my attention held it injected humor and made me like him was fantastic intro to human behavior indeed,2
relevance physiology and behaviour a categorical thinking b multilevel approach similarities repurposing peculiarities course structure organizational matters,1
i really hope that professor sapolsky knows how many people all over the world he captures through the screen with his amazing ability to teach,2
the fact that we can access this lecture without having to attend stanford is mindblowing what a time to be alive,2
im literally in middle school yet im able to follow this to an extent really makes it obvious that this professors great at his job,2
im so grateful for living in an era where this kind of content is available like this im from brazil and i wouldnt be able to listen to this amazing classes if stanford and professor sapolsky werent so kind to make it available online thank you,2
coming back on that lecture youre an absolute gem robert sapolsky ive discovered this video a year ago searched my way through the infite possibilities of life finally started my bachelor in psychology and i head on becoming a researcher in evolutionary psychology or something like that if things go well and if i still like it hopefully i see you some day at stanford university,2
this is an absolutely amazing lecture because he doesnt just dive into the subject he outlines the way to approach it without thinking in boxes its a refresher for scientific and critical thinking abilities designed to help unravel a very complex and challenging subject i think im going to be spending some quality hours here with the dr one of his lectures on koko the gorilla brought me to this playlist,2
the fact that baby orcas have to learn their language shows how intelligent these beings are,2
the fact that whalesdolphins can legally just be kept at places like seaworld is just insane given just the information in this video,0
its really fascinating to see the orcas movements in front of the mirror they move with this careful consideration and grace that you also see in species like the dolphin or gorilla or humans for that matters,2
when i was a kid i was a given a plush orca that immediately became my best friend it wasnt until years later that i found out that orcas are actually fearsome beasts that sat at the top of the oceans food chain and honestly i just fell in love with them even more,2
one of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesn t mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca but orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt they might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they re known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,2
the lummi nation refer to the local orcas as qwe lhol mechen which means our relatives who live under the sea or the people under the waves orcas live in tightknit families in most cases both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives this is especially true for southern and northern residents orcas are incredibly intelligent and social their limbic system the part of the brain that processes emotion is incredibly developed and complex each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate theyre the only species besides humans pilot whales beluga whales and narwhals that go through menopause famous southern resident orcas fish eaters lolita granny ocean sun tahlequah who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for days moby doll shamu luna theres a documentary about luna called the whale famous northern resident orcas fish eaters namu corky tsitika eve sharky top notch springer the only orca to have been successfully reintegrated back into the wild famous transient orcas mammaleaters lonesome george fatfin chainsaw esperanza sidney and her children raksha and her five daughters,2
i remember watching black fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,0
orcas really are the humans of the sea theyre everywhere eat anything work in groups have dialects pass down skills over generations and have great teamwork skills if they were humans i would say they are in a sort of tribal stage its only a matter of time before they become advanced one way or another,2
i love that seafaring mammals evolved out of the ocean were unimpressed with the land and just went back,2
what a dream it would be to be able to actually communicate to orcas at some point communicating with other intelligent species is so huge,2
howdy ho peeps we ve a new track and a music video out with our friends nublu gameboy tetris they re some of our favourite vocal gurus in the whole world we ve been wanting to do something together for a while now and here it is also thanks to our amazing friends in the video crew for making the song come alive visually we had an awesome weekend driving around estonia partying with our friends we got to see nublu faceplanting from the top of a monster truck almost got joosep killed with a golf club ago set his guitar on fire gameboy grilled us food on some bricks etc enjoy coca cola ps lyrics below,2

this is a true brothership awesome video and song,2
ncs,1
worth every minute i listened i am not either a scientist or a researcher i am just the average joanne who is so grateful that there are enquiring minds always striving to know more,2
this lecture just flew by always a good sign for me and kept me interested throughout thanks love how seemingly unrelated eventsdiscoveries lead to more investigation experimentation and discovery reminds me of that great bbc series connections,2
that alien analogy works well in every branch of sciencewhat a wonderful way to establish a context for such an engaging lecturethank you,2
to visually see the smallest machines working in a living cell is a wonderment the smallest machines in the cell exhibit intelligence and decision making to actually see them in action in real time is astonishing,2
very well done i liked your analogy with football soccer and the microscope to start as you went on i got more interested and i had to buy the book to learn more although i am not a scientist of cells i am a scientist of knowledge so your book will add to my knowledge base and maybe a breakthrough for me in certain aspects of my domain,2
the start was excellent a good metaphor maybe its the way we understand the world around us and the way we learn any subject thanks for sharing,2
this was absolutely fascinating one of the best lectures on youtube ever well presented very enthusiastic knowledgeable and informative i look forward to making my choices in the future i think the quote at the end was superb,2
thank you for this lecture im still amazed about origin of those tools,2
in my dissertation work i used the nonfluorescent halves of different fluorescent proteins and engineered expression vectors for genes that encoded these appended to target proteins wt and oncogenic mutant cfes kinases such that the targets would be competentfunctional with the attached fp halves but then when they binddimerizeoligomerize to perform phosphorylationdependent enzymatic activity then the fp halves would bind as well to become a whole fluorescent protein tagging the target protein dimers this approach allowed us to observe the action of our targets localization quantify dimerization as a proxy for kinase function in this case as well etc molecular biology is built upon so many toolstechniques that are in and of themselves amazing,1
brilliant great presentation the future is going to be exciting and scary at the same time great technology seems to get weaponized asap in our world thank you,2
i had one as a pet when a kid didnt realize i had a god in my fishtank,1
bought two as a present for my wife theyre interesting little animals and a lot more intelligent than i would have thought they recognize my wife as the one who feeds them when she walks in the room they come to the front of the tank and start swimming up and down to get her attention if someone told me they do that never would have believed them,2
im from mexico and it kills me to see that one of our national treasures is dying off also feel very much impotent at the fact that i cant do much about it c,0
i have an axolotl currently and he s been with me since or and he wasn t a newborn when i received him believe it or not he is definitely a god in the amphibian world at least,2
while really interesting i cant help but feel bad for all the axelotl that had to endure amputation and maybe worse for this to be researched especially the one that got their rejuvenation blocked,0
i spent minutes watching a bunch of cute salamanders while learning about them you earned a sub,2
learning about scientists finding a new home literally made me choke up axolotls are my favorite animal and i try to support any conservation organization centered around them as much as i can they are such beautiful and magnificent creatures and im so happy they have been in the limelight more often these days i truly hope their wild population can begin flourishing again,2
i cut off tip of my thumb and it regrew i was told it was because i retained nail bed which produces stem cells it was incredible process there was nothing to stitch shut no skin and couldnt reattach tip so they used a special material on it for a while removing that was horrifying but there isnt even any scar tissue and my finger print grew back too however the nerves didnt fair quite as well it has that asleep pins and needles feeling to it so i did physical therapy to get used to fine motor tasks and its pretty much normal now i wonder if animals new limbs have less sensitivity too though,0
my yo daughter loves axolotls i don t know why i m being particularly emotional from this video but it has really made me cry i m going to look and see what digital adoptions there are for axolotls my daughter has a birthday coming up and a good gift would be a sponsorship in her name she s just a bit too young to keep one herself maybe in high school if she s still into it,2
axolotl in aztecs scary water monster god axolotl in minecraft water wolf that squeaks axolotl rl i eat worm nom,1
expand to see important notes for this video this video as stated in the description focuses on general functions of biomolecules the biomolecules carbs lipids proteins and nucleic acids can all can have important functions in the body this is a video about the general function of biomolecules for your dietary needs consult with a dietitian or medical doctor we mention the popular cho cho chon chonp mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules as we mention these are basics there can be more elements such as sulfur for example in proteins but we wanted to identify common elements starting at the building block level at the building block level some amino acids lack sulfur for example its not just sulfur for example there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen the popular cho cho chon chonp mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates one character for lipids and one character for proteins unfortunately when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type it isnt designed to show a specific type we received a great point in an email though that since our little lipid character is a triglyceride this can be confusing when naming lipid functions for example at in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there wont be any confusion as we do not want to imply that specific lipid type makes up the cell membrane phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well we plan to explore creating individual detailed videos on lipids carbs and proteins where we can show different types update we have videos dubbed in spanish and portuguese using an artificial voice via to increase accessibility see our amoeba sisters en espa ol channel and amoeba sisters em portugu s want to help translate our subtitles in any language learn more here,1
my teacher literally does this shows powerpoint stays on a slide for like seconds says memorize this then moves on repeat like x everyday this is a lifesaver thank you,2
all the dislikes are the students that had to take notes on this for biology,0
pov ur teacher sent u hear then u got bored now ur reading comments,0
bio teachers reading the comments,1
really like how you guys explain the major points in a fun and entertaining way,2
i wish my biology teacher explained biomolecules like this,1
you have earned another subscriber this is both educational and funny you have a very unique way explaining things this is very useful for any science tests or quizzes i have ahead,2
can you make videos about the structures of each macromolecule it would help me to better understand the differences in them thanks you are the best,2
years old content and still helping to educate us students thanks,2
because nobody else has done it ill do it for you microorganisms cell nucleus archaea mitosis meiosis cell differentiation krebs cycle mitochondria neurotransmission hormones photosynthesis tropical biodiversity ecosystems,1
the world needs more documentaries like this more bill nye as well,2
povyou were drawing in science class while they played this video so now you re struggling with the worksheet alone,0
it s kind of crazy how cells are so small,0
pov your watching this for school,1
hes not a great voice actor but he is a dignified voice for science hes much more a science voice and worker than some think engineers with chemistry and general science backgrounds are technically scientists he is a voice for reason in a time of pseudoscience and fake politics,1
it s weird how cells and molecules seem abstract but they re anything but because they are real af,1
great documentary,2
good documentary,2
im watching this for school and i have it on full speed,1
the part about the mutated dna is insane during the process of evolution some of these plants basically repurposed and readjusted their basic plant toolkit for a drastically different purpose the fundamental working remains similar clearly establishing a link to the original version yet the execution and result are completely new,1
what i find most interesting of all of this is how the underlying mechanisms for carnivory are rootedpun intendedin the genomes of many plants since theyre usually used for defense against pathogens and herbivorous insects with how common knowledge carnivorous plants are it really surprises me that they arent used as examples of how evolution works with what it has also makes one realise how plants are very much alive and aware of the world surrounding them,2
loved this video i have always found carnivorous plants fascinating had had several venus flytraps but i didn t know how they actually worked or evolved thank you for the video,2
yes an insane biology of carnivorous plants i m an amateur cps grower on my free time and a fan of the channel it s the perfect combination though on aren t waterwheels aldrovanda traps also snap traps i believe bladderworts utricularia are the ones with suction traps,2
normal plants i live in harmony with animals and sometimes even cooperate with them venus fly trap peace was never an option,1
woh i cant wait to learn about the biology of venus fly traps so i can genetically engineer my own carnivorous plants,2
you re awesome i find real engineering s content interesting but it s yours which inspires me to become a genetic engineer,2
nature now meateating plants nature years in the future photosynthetic humans,1
species of carnivorous plants wow and how did i never know that venus fly trap pitcher plants were both native to the us i had always assumed they were exotic tropical plants this was a fascinating informative video,2
thank you so much for answering this question i knew that it was a nitrogen poor environment that drove the evolution of carnivorous plants but the specifics of how their dna changed to do so was always a mystery and now i will go eat some bacon,2
heres the link to the podcast,1
theyre found on every continent except antarctica ironic,1
imagine being a baby and your aunt decides to use you for arts and crafts,1
ants are truly insane did you know that wood ants even sacrifice their own lives to save their colony the territorial battles that break out between neighboring anthills each spring are warfare of the highest order involving thousands of casualties and chemical weapons our film team was thrilled when they watched two colonies how they conduct scouting expeditions and subdue their enemies,0
the dying of a colony after a queen dies depends on the ant species yellow crazy ants for one are known to merge nests with other yellow crazy ants and housing multiple queens,1
arent they awesome true rulers of the earth ant love forever ps hate to be that guy but the creatures at are actually termites not your fault whoever catalogued that footage thought they were ants ive seen the exact stock footage used in tv shows and videos about ants,2
dude where did this amazing channel come from absolutely flawless sound design script and editing,2
its very impressive how much stock footage they were able to find on ants,2
first thing that came to mind when talking about the most dominant creature was funghi and lichen we need to know more about funghi and lichen,1
maybe you immediately thought of the blue whale nah mate thought of ants its the title of the video,1
i love that even the indigenous people from australia who already deal with tons of weird animals were like nah this little guy is too weird to be normal,0
the platypus is a monotreme it lactates and lays eggs that means its one of the few animals that can make its own custard,1
platypus is what you get when you let people create a custom character,1
not to mention he could overthrow an not really evil professor,1
platypuses are one of the coolest animals alive im surprised we havent hunted this thing to extinction yet,2
more facts about the platypuses they used to be giants the ancient versions of a lot of modern animals including penguins were oversized monsters compared to the animals we know today and platypuses are no different in the discovery of a single tooth helped researchers identify a prehistoric platypus that was more than three feet long double the size of the modern animal they lack a stomach platypuses platypodes and platypi are technically also correct but much rarer in use arent the only animals to forgo an acidproducing part of the gut spiny echidnas and nearly a quarter of living fishes all have a gullet that connects directly to their intestines good day,1
please give us as many the insane biology of videos as possible,1
theres a lot more unusual stuff under the hood of these guys and their echidna cousins their skeletons for example have epipubic bones aka pouch bones which are only found in marsupials and monotremes but more unusual still they have bones in their pectoral girdle while all other mammals have only two on a human for example the pectoral girdle aka the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum it means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket compare this to birdsreptiles and older tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum this third bone is the coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in monotremes on the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig splayed legs more ribs than other mammals low body heat eggs venom etc honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointynosed hedgehog,1
the echidna just walking around is absolutely freaking adorable,2
a sixth sense that almost no other mammal has i a mammal also have an electric bill,1
when a high youtuber explains biology better in minutes than sober qualified teacher does in weeks,2
john green taught me books can make me even more depressed than i thought and hank green made me realize biology is cool which inevitably made me realize i want to be a forensic scientist thank you hank,2
i just wanted to thank yall at crash course for this biology series last year i had to take a state biology test that is a part of a series of tests that are mandatory to pass to get your high school diploma i decided to watch these biology vids to help prep because i wasnt feeling prepared enough it ended up that a big section of the test was on a topic we didnt go over in class but i had watched crash course vids about it anyway i just recently found out that i did pass my test so just thank you guys so much i dont know if i wouldve made it through my test if it wasnt for these vids,2
i love the way you teach i have adhd and can never pay attention so thanks for being weird and not boring like most professors with my adhd it affects me remembering things i want to actually know and learn this subject and other subjects and not just memorize for the test then forget everything a month later any advice on studying or other tips to really keep the info embedded in my mind,0
my ap bio teacher took an entire week to teach us this and you a drunk man taught it to me in minutes amazing,2
even the sexiest person you have ever met in your life is just a collection of organic compounds rambling around in a sack of water i dont know about you but thinking about that statement gives me tremendously less anxiety when conversing with people i find attractive,1
i just catched up with the whole year of th grade and i have never understood chemistry this good thank you,2
im here from the year and hank green has facial hair,1
great way to get ahead so i can make it into honors bio crash course is absolutely fantastic its essentially free school and better school too its gets to the point and isnt all information its fun quick and educational youve done something amazing here hank,2
youre awesome thank you for making biology more accessible,2
pull up to my hotel like im cassidyyy,1
pierre changed his whole production style too many people copying his beats,0
pierre deserves every bit of success he gets he uplifting so many artists careers it s time he gets recognized for how versatile he can be behind the mic congrats pierre,2
we can go on maury,1
this song was well produced everytime i hear it it puts me in one of the highest times of my life it has a permanent happy effect on me hotels money bitches good tree and tequila sunrises long nights,2
pierre you truly changed my life with your sound ever since my junior year of hs when my brother played doublemint in the car i have been attached to your music since then i have had memories with every song that you dropped i just want to thank you for finally dropping this album and continue to do you and makerelease your music,2
i hate how underrated this man is but i lowkey like it at the same time,0
i was alive when this man made music,2
slaps like an abusive relationship,0
this by far the best song on the album,2
the insane biology series is so much cooler than the insane engineering series,2
people how is it possible for a fish to generate so much electricity the fish the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural,1
this is one of the best channels on youtube for sure what an indepth video on electric eels its fascinating what complex creatures they are i mean remotely controlling their prey is just next level stuff imagine what else is out there,2
i absolutely adore this series of insane biology the long videos and high quality content keep it coming,2
its shocking how your videos are so consistently amazing i would say this is the best series of videos i know of on youtube theres the whole rest of the channel however thats just as good,2
genuine question during the experiment with the dead fish how did the eel knew the fish responded to its doublet when there was an agar barrier between them placed there to particularly impede the electric shock you mentioned the eels eyesight is poor and they rely heavily on their electrolocation of prey answers are appreciated thanks,0
i actually had a professor back in college that had gone down to the amazon to study these creatures,1
omg that little comment at the end about texas electric grid had me gagged lol i live in texas and experienced the utter failures of the february winter storm i love these videos so much and even just a passing mention of the electricity crisis here by anyone is something that makes me very happy to hear keep up the awesome videos they are very much loved and appreciated,2
such depth and intricacies when it comes to the discussions kudos to this im learning and im loving it,2
really appreciate this series for both the entertainment and how scientifically backed everything is i had no idea they were the inspiration for voltaic cells and the remote control before an attack so cool,2
first there was a world ruled by birds and now a world ruled by frogs whats next cats snakes elephants the possibilities are truly endless in speculative evolution,1
i love speculative biology but this project has one problem as i see it the idea is presented that these amphibians wouldnt transition to forms of exothermic metabolism we have evidence that both crocodilians and dinosaurs could change from warmblooded to coldblooded and back again birds being warmblooded reptiles show the transition from ectothermic to exothermic lifestyles why wouldnt amphibians do the same over the eons in one shape or another,1
i had the incredible luck of being roxys classmate in university and coworker through some crazy jobs she is one of the best artists i have ever met and a truly top notch person and friend thank you for highlighting her amazing work isnt it cool as hell,2
has there ever been any speculative evolution of the octopus i would very much like to see that since there have already been xenobiologists who have described the rise of octopus since they have massive amounts of neurons eg throughout the animal including each leg which has the ability to feel taste and smell it is known that they have a great degree of intelligence from using that different type of brain they already have their own video channels such as octolab etc but i remember someone showing drawings of octos swinging through trees id dearly love to see these creatures advance thru the eons,2
an animal evolving a foamlike cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept goddamn now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm over millions of years the glands adapt eventually the foam glands evolve into something similar to hair follicles that produce very soft bulbs of keratin we now have frog sheep made of cloud bubbles this sounds like such an adorable fairy tale but also oddly possible in real life,2
i m sorry but i laughed every time you said greater moist boy every time this was another great speculative world and i liked that it was an alternate history of our own planet the last few videos have taken us to some truly insane alien worlds which i have loved but it always feels nice to come back home and speculate about our own pale blue dot and all the ways it could have turned out differently i love your channel so much,2
there were several things that were not taken into account when evolving over time they stuck way too closely to frog morphology and tried to hammerfit it into each of the niches amphibians have varied morphology now that were advantageous for land dwelling amphibians but were not mentioned amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of amphibian every evolved amphibian retained frog eyes and body structure evolution is also influenced by things never mentioned as well predator prey relationships drive evolution fast running prey animals and predictors are an example size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many dont have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs this limits size the larger the animal the more oxygen is needed thats why lungs evolved this would also change mouth and nose shape,1
the speculative world ruled by decapods such as crabs lobsters hermit crabs and shrimp seems interesting considering how diverse they are,2
one thing about the inhabitated lodge given its a desert animal i think it would make more sense if its tadpoles inhabit its back a protected reservoir seems tl be good for tadpoles in a water poor enviroment and given how beecomb frogs already carry their eggstadpoles in chambers of there belly this would feel like a nice nod to this real animal in addition this could be a way to get mammalian or placentalian amphibians of sorts if it would continue to evolve along this line,2
i love these what if speculative documentaries i love the ideas of what if some animals were the dominant species friggin love the moist bois and the freeple my favorite idea is a cephalopod world in the game splatoon the lore is people died to a massive war and sea life took hold its kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation science gone wrong or the lack of mammalian predators so i wonder what a squid or octo world would be like would both evolve simultaneously like the inklings and octolings did would civilization rise again i dunno i wonder what a realistic splatoon world would be where sealife specifically invertebrates evolved,2
he literally explained a two hour long lesson in minutes im shook,2
let me just say god bless this brilliant man and his brother for teaching topics in minutes that teachers needed weeks for no offense teachers,2
crash course helping kids cram for their exams since day one,1
started watching this my freshman year in high school now im watching them my freshman year in college,1
it has been eight years since this video was uploaded i watched it for the first time about four or five years ago when i was in high school i prepared for the biology exam by these videos i wathced this course when i was on the first year of medical university and now im watching it again im already finishing the third year and i teach biology scholars who like myself some time ago are about to enroll a med university this is awesome thank you hank and thanks to all of the crashcourse team for this truly the greatest course of biology ever made,2
this really helps my teacher only lectures and she skips a lot because we are already supposed to know it and we are expected to know x the information she actually gives us,2
i keep on getting med school ads on these bio videos and im like dude im just tryna pass grade calm down,0
my bio teacher is wellknown for not paying attention to any of her classes except chemistry and then at the end of the year giving out candy to all of her other classes and apologizing for being a shitty teacher of course that does nothing to raise my grade in her class but these videos do thanks so much yall for helping me understand this flipping course,0
trying to test out of bio so i can eventually get my third degree nursing thanx hank along with that here is what i quickly typed down as a sort of summary feel free to fix william prout discovered our stomachs have hydrochloric acid and discovered chemical composition of urea also discovered food is divided into carbs fats and proteins carbohydrates are the source of all energy carbs are made of sugars with the simplest being monosaccharides glucose a monosaccharide number sugar that comes from the sun fructose same chemical as glucose but arranged differently and is sweeter disaccharides are two monosaccharides put together sucrose fructose and glucose connected is a disaccharide joined by a covalent bond polysaccharides are thousands of simple sugar units cellulose is a bunch of glucose molecules bread is made of starch and amylase our bodies store carbs in form of glycogen in our muscle until we need to use them we store our energy long term through fat aka lipids lipids are non polar and can t dissolve in water fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids saturated fats don t have double bonds while unsaturated fats do trans fat do not exist in nature and are unsaturated and bad for the body omega fats unsaturated are essential but we need to eat them in order to get them phospholipids form cell membrane walls to keep bad stuff out and good stuff in phospholipids are one end polar and one end non polar steroids a phospholipid made of carbon rings are used to make cholesterol proteins of made of amino acids which do everything for the body nitrogen can only be gotten into our bodies from food via foods high in protein polypeptides are formed by long chains of amino acids the essential amino acids which are bodies can t make on their own are histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine,1
as a nutrition professor thank you for this such a great resource for students,2
this song is essentially four different choruses its absolutely genius,2
rip sarah this is potentially the best pop song of all time what a legacy,2
ga were the oddest thing the most manufactured of bands that released the most boundarypushing and brillant pop music,1
i think this song is clever as hell the way its written and produced you can say what you like about xenomania but personally i think they deserve credit where credits due they make melodic pop music with a twist,2
its such a shame this song wasnt a hit in america this is pop perfection,0
the choreographer clearly gave them like two runthroughs of the dance before running out of time and just saying fuck it thisll do,0
rip sarah you will be missed but this world is all the better for having had you in it x,2
i cant see myself getting tired of their songs this song is one of their best,2
in my humble opinion this is the best pop song of the noughties a threeminute masterpiece pop music is so dull at the moment oh for a group this much fun again as for those rather sad people who still think its ok to describe the bright interesting talented nicola roberts as ugly gingereasy to say it anonymously isnt it hmm oh and forgot to say downright gorgeous,2
without doubt the best song that has ever existed a verse another verse a prechorus and a chorus brilliant,2
this guy hes someone kids should look up to,2
i feel like teachers like him could make anyone interested in anything big respect,2
they could have this guy on times and i ll still eagerly watch every episode,2
as someone who graduated with a bio degree i truly wish he was a professor at my school his natural excitement and passion for science is infectious and i feel like he would ve made microbio so fun,2
he chose the one most wholesome answer you could hope to receive mans basically said if i could bring back one species itd be the species that could save another that i love the man is too wholesome my heart,2
honestly just bring him in every week at this point id never get tired of him tbh,2
this guys pretty wholesome good job on bringing him back,2
im majoring in biology so mad respect for you dr thor hanson,2
as a history major he speaks the way that made me fall in love with history he himself is fascinated by his own knowledge so it never becomes obvious or get boring,2
fun fact on that last question a good of the foods we refer to as vegetables are actually fruits there are actually not that many edible vegetable kind of plants the reason these fruits are called vegetables is a result of culinary distinction rather than a biological one labelling the plant by its use in dishes rather than what it is categorically,1
remember in elementary school when all you needed to know is photosynthesis needs the sun water and carbon dioxide to make food now it has come to this,1
i appreciate the fact that he admits this process is stupidly hard for no reason except science,1
i remembered having to learn about this when i was in high school biology so i came back to see if it would come back to me at age nope i ended up rocking back and forth in the corner of my office in the feeble position then i snapped out of it i now embrace this truth plants turn water sunlight and co into food using magic,2
watching this the day before my bio exam and realizing that i m so gonna fail,0
everyone here is cramming for ap biology but i m just cramming for normal biology how is this fair,1
i have my test in an hour so far i know electrons are involved somehow,1
mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell thats what ive learned so far,1
you are committed to having a better deeper understanding of our world or more probably youd like to do good on your test hahahaha this hank guy is the best,2
for the lazy d gl on tests photosystem ii captures and transfers energy chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight energized electrons enter electron transport chain water molecules are split oxygen is released as waste hydrogen ions are transported across thylakoid membrane photosystem i captures energy and produces energycarrying molecules chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight energized electrons are used to make nadph nadph is transferred to lightindependent reactions,1
i failed biology times already this is my th time taking the class first time actually trying to seriously understand it i ve been watching your videos that relate to what we re learning in class i want to thank you for helping me earn a on my first exam i m so grateful for you,2
could you imagine if a bunch of aliens dropped super predators on a city just to see how the humans adapt to it,1
the fact that humans need stab proof vest to survive one of these guys tells you how deadly they can be,0
and there are still people that dare to say modern dinosaurs are boring just take a look at this absolute unit,0
im from brazil and i heard ranchers telling stories such as about that time their grandpa saw a harpy lifting a newborn calf duting his youth or that day a harpy snatched a hound in goi s clearly exagerations wild tales but it shows the reverence respect and even fear the harpy commands on people also the state police here where im from has harpia as a callsign their helicopters,0
i wonder if the harpy calls werent only used to identify primates without a response but to actually wear down their awareness overtime by conditioning them to expect calls before seeing the eagle we might see more of those mixups and mindgames if we observed them in areas where primates lived alongside eagles for more than a year,0
ive been a fan of harpys for years now but this video blew my mind the amount of intelligence gathered by the eagles during the bci experiment is huge birds are truly in the same conversation as mammals in terms of ingenuity,2
kg of pressure the engineer inside me really felt that one,1
i cannot get over how gorgeous this bird is it s just beautiful incredible animal,2
you have the best science channel on the web hands down it easily rivals anything i ve seen on television i am so damn impressed with every video i ve seen from your team and you deserve many millions of subscribers thank you for a consistently incredible and enriching source of entertainment and education,2
i train a small hawk and the strength hes capable of at his size is unreal i could only imagine what a harpy could do,2
the hour long complicated version with finger puppets is literally what i need,2
ah the photosynthesis and cellular respiration unit of biology good luck to everyone else suffering,2
since the animations are kinda confusing the numbers up i recapped the transformation here glycolysis glucose atp pyruvates energy this energy is used for making atp net profit of atp and nadh from adp nad and hydrogen probably h fermentation pyruvate energy lactic acid krebs cycle pyruvates o acetyl coenzyme a co energy this energy is used to form nadh from nad and hydrogen acetyl coenzyme a oxaloacetic acid citric acid citric acid o oxaloacetic acid energy co this energy is used to make atp nadh and fadh so after the krebs cycle we now have nadh fadh and atp or if you count the atp spent in glycolysis electron transport chain nadh energy nad hydrogen this energy is used to pump some protons out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria they went back through the atp synthase creating at most atp for each nadh for a total of atp at most fadh energy fad hydrogen this energy is also used to pump some protons this creates at most atp each fadh for a total of atp conclusion total atp created molecules if the cell is very efficient atp is spent in glycolysis so there would be at most atp that went through the steps nad were used and probably reused fad were used and also probably reused o were used and they became co in the krebs cycle oxaloacetic acid were used and reused hope this helps,1
it s been years and i m gonna need that enzyme puppet show now,1
i wish he was my bio teacher he makes everything so fun and easy also who has an exam tomorrow,2
probably shouldve paid attention in class questioning life choices,0
adenosine triphosphate shoots off third phosphate group adenosine die phosphate,0
ive been going to a hour lecture everyday for a week and picked up nothing about cellular respiration crash course literally taught me and helped me understand this in minutes,2
cells are too complicated for their own good soon they will band together and become powerful enough to take over the wor oh wait,1
my brain is not excepting this knowledge,0
do you know how you remember that mycology is the study of fungi because mike is a fun guy hyuck hyuck hyuck,2
well i disagree with the answer to question because mitochondria itself has its own dna,0
i only missed five questions i m proud of myself,2
i find too difficultbut i learned more from this video thank you,2
it was really easy despite the fact that my native language is belarussian,2
currently i am in class because my session is going to start from april then i will be in class still i got in this bio quiz unbelievable,2
wow i got thank you for the video,2
i did pretty good,2
it refreshed my knowledge thank you,2
very interesting quizzes,2
these speculative biologies are always fun to watch always makes you wonder what really is out there,2
dumb idea a ca video thats literally just exploring life on earth describing the lifeforms with examples from fictional works in a role reversal way treating the very real animals like their pieces of speculative work and vice versa ie in the vast earth oceans live an apex predator unchanged for millions of years the shark though they look remarkably simular to the squidsharks of b but are more closely related to earth fish than squids as a terrible example,0
i really like these speculative alien lifeforms better than many weve seen on here i think its bc they feel aesthetically natural like they are unlike most earth organisms but feel like they still obey the constraints of biophysics,2
my son used to love drawing his own speculative alien worlds from single cells to highly evolved he never ceased to amaze me with how rich and diverse he populated them i stumbled across awesome videos like this one and learned what he had done is a whole thing i share these with him and hope they spark his imagination as much as he does my own thank you for sharing these with us edit thank you for your patience if you still would like to see his old drawings its a busy time of year but well get the track down and posted on my little channel soon,2
another wellmade video about speculative biology keep it up sir,2
this is one of the most fleshed out speculative biologies ive seen in this channel so far the illustrations are high quality and the little interactions between these organisms in their alien ecosystem can be derived from the illustrations themselves and its really interesting,2
something ive noticed about alien spec bio things is that i dont often see structures analogous to fur or feathers on the critters i wonder why,0
i love that this had very distinct biomes and body plans from each other they all looked like they d evolved together but really varied in color size and overall form it also allowed for much more realistic looking while still bloody great and weird scenes idk i really liked this one it was cool and kinda realistic in a weird way,2
i would suggest checking out the anime made in the abyss for a potential episode the fictional creatures in the work are downright awe inspiring as they are bizarre,2
one area of speculative are the predictions of life on the planets of our solar system as you may have seen in lemminos recent video people have proposed ideas for life on the moon mars venus etc for hundreds of years as well as modern day in that same sense videos surrounding the biology of aliens visiting earth ie usually as invaders would be interesting,1
the animated movie made by sergey krivoplyasov and antropogenezru why don t apes evolve into humans subscribe to our channel become a patron,1
thanks to cameraman live from million years ago for the documentary,2
its amazing that the skulls remain in the soil for millions of years for us to do such detailed scientific researches on without them we never knew what they looked like or how they evolved fossils really are precious legacy of our ancestors,2
its truly mindblowing to know how far weve come and how weve become the dominant species on earth in such a short amount of time considering how advanced weve become technologically it seems almost impossible to think that we are also animals evolution is truly amazing,2
ill never forget visiting the natural history section of the smithsonian institute as a kid with my parents back in the s im now btw they had an exhibit there that would blow your mind it consisted of a wall depicting human evolution where they had probably a hundred or so skulls in rows against a dark backdrop i assume so the images would stand out better it led the viewer visually from humans earliest known ancestors with authentic fossil skulls from the most primitive eg australopithicus all the way to modern man homo sapiens it was quite impressive and left the viewer with no doubt about human evolution there it was in terms of a tangible fossil record expertly organized right before the viewers eyes,2
wow i would love an hour long video with who ever made this that was so informative and to the point thank you,2
human long ago survival mode human now creative mode,1
so over years ago we actually came to what experts believe the closest to extinction we ve ever been it s believed to have been caused by a supervolcano the toba supervolcano then sunk into the ground and became lake toba,1
some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about or million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,0
they forgot a thing we chew our food,1
me watching this masterpiece after years,2
hats off to the camera man who traveled with the food edit likes tnq for the likes guys i never got this,2
the gut is sooo important if you liked this video you may also be interested in knowing the indicators of a healthy gut they include colon transit time of hours type stool on the bristol stool chart not having diarrhea or constipation having bowel movements per day and lightdark brown colored stools,2
what a great video to watch right before dinner,2
respect to the cameraman who survived all that turning and shaking and the acids,2
cameraman never disappoints us,2
this is just amazing and very helpful thank you,2
shout out to the cameraman for shrinking down and taking these sweet videos,2
new generation is so lucky to have accesswith these kind of presentation,2
content i was taught in two painfully long minute lectures condensed into minutes of concise straightforward understandable content thank you for existing,2
crash course is literally one of the greatest things to ever grace the internet,2
when a bunch of cells is watching a bunch of cells explaining a bunch of cells,1
mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,1
just popping in to say crashcourse is helping me survive biology class ive learned more from one video than i have in the month of class so far,2
notes animal cell eukaryotic cells with membrane organelles and nucleus containing dna that calls the shots animal plants fungi and protist flexible and squishy membranes as oppose to plants allowing the creation of cell organs and tissue types cell is like a city on the surface microtubials made of long protein fibers cillia tiny arms like in lungs and throat pushing the mucus up and flagella whiplike tail like in sperms protozoans move with microtubials instead of muscle tissue membrane selective permeability monitoring coming in and out like boarders inside cytoplasm waternutrients cytoskeleton scaffolding made of protein strands centrosomes infrastructures endoplasmic reticulum er network of membranes like a highway system the smoother parts of er are like factories containing enzymes proteins producing lipids detoxifying substances by adding carboxyl to make them soluble in water storing ions like sodium used for energy the rougher parts of er have ribosomes attached to them synthesis and packaging of proteins ribosomes float freely assemble amino acids into polypeptides pushing the protein chain into er where its bitten off and sent to golgi aparatus golgi made of membranous layers the post office for packaging proteins cutting them into hormones combining them with carbs to make molecules vessicles the packages with phospholipid walls lysosome waste treatment and recycling sacks containing enzymes breaking down cell waste into building material mitochondria the power plant where respiration takes place fuels converted to adenosine triphosphate atp which is the currency they were separate bacteria that animal cells absorbed and kept and they still act as their own organisms with their own dna they exist in the egg and doesnt mix with sperms dna during fertilization nucleus the leader contains dna and has all the information and instructions has a double membrane nucleoplasm is like cytoplasm nucleolus at the center creates ribosomal rnaproteinsribosomes messenger rna carry the orders to ribosomes chromatin weblike substance that holds dna molecules upon cell division they gather into rodshaped chromosome humans have,1
i love how excited he gets about mitochondria,2
when youre watching this because your bio teacher cannot teach,0
i love that crash course doesnt only teach biology but finds a way for me to care for biology,2
my biology textbook is the worst thing ever written a full chapter takes only about a page and teaches nothing thank god for crash course,0
my opinion was always that wyverns are a typesubspecies of dragon saying thats not a dragon thats a wyvern is about as useful as saying thats not a dog thats a border collie,1
if hippos were carnivores that lit their prey on fire so all the nightmares at once,0
i like how the true dragons didnt end up looking like the stereotypical dragon instead they had a very quetzalcoatl appearance which makes it believable as cool as a dragon looking like draco from dragonheart would be i could see a pterosaurlike dragon being more realistic,2
have you ever heard of the animated movie a flight of dragons they answer a lot of dragon biology questions like the fact that dragons can fly because they are essentially organic hydrogen balloons and they breathe fire to vent it off,1
i remember a highschool biology project in which we had to create a basic phylogeny graph for dragons including drawings it was very fun,2
i m surprised there isn t more dragons with names taken directly from mythical dragons i could absolutely see orochi gorynych lindwurms basilisks serrushes leviathan behemoth ziz python ladon and even to an extent typhon fitting in well to this family tree,2
i d love this as a video game create a skyrimesque world except where dragons aren t mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society like a smart dolphin i think the approach would be cool bc it could be a mechanism for keeping humans in a medieval age since dragons would prey on cities like wolves on sheep,2
i actually pondered on how dragons would be able to breath fire and i brought the topic up to my mom i had the idea that they had to have an organ in their body that would produce a highly reactive gas or liquid and that when it was forced out it would either ignite from the oxygen or something else would ignite it internally which is where my mom got the idea that dragons would have a crop like chickens have and throughout a dragons lifetime they would eat rocks of flint that would go into that crop when the dragon needed to breath fire that crop would constrict extremely fast while the gasliquid came up igniting and sending out flames the dragons internals being protecting by a thick flame retardant mucus,1
since we did dragons and horse paleontology is so rarely touched on a unicorn or other myth creature could be another cool video,2
until a few years ago i didnt even know about the dragon wyvern debate ive always thought and still do all wyverns are dragons not every dragon is a wyvern just like every duck is a bird but not every bird is a duck dragon is just a broad term for many different creatures the one with four legs and two wings are european dragons just my way of thinking not saying it as a factnot sure what most peoples opinion is,1
a summary video two water h o uses a covalent bond each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen it is thus a polar molecule all water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity these are hydrogen bonds between the positive and negative poles of different molecules hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion and thus high surface tension cohesion is the attraction between two like things eg two water molecules water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things eg water and glass capillary action is water defying gravity water is the greatest solvents due to its polarity hydrophilic molecules are polar their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are nonpolar solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily when frozen water has a very high heat capacity it is good at holding on to heat thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets,2
im an accounting student but i had a horrible chemistry teacher in high school and im taking this courses solely to have a better understanding of the world around me and all i wanted to say was that theyve been really helpful in making me understand with a little extra reasearch all the basics of chemistry thank you crashcourse,2
it cant penetrate and come into it hank likes his biology hardcore,1
so around degrees fahrenheit or degree celsius if youre a scientist or from a part of the world where things make sense im dying here,1
to summarize this video h o is a covalent bond hydrogen bonds stick together hydrogen bonds are weak cohesion is the attraction between two like things water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid adhesion is the act of water spreading out adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things capillary action is water defying gravity water is a polar molecule water is a solvent the greatest,1
i think we all know why hank smiled when he said it cant penetrate and come into it,1
this is what causes some bugs i think one lizard and also one jesus to be able to walk on water hank how the hell were you able to say that with a straight face,0
it cant penetrate and come into ithank,1
hey there hank im a junior in high school whos currently taking chemistry and i was wondering if you had any resources on heat capacity we were studying the heat capacity of water and metals like iron and aluminum which is somehow related to the video i guess thank you very much zelda,2
i credit crash course with my success in bio when you cover chapters a week and youre taking credit hours classes total its pretty much hilariously impossible to actually grasp the material as you progress and really understand it,0
im at a point where i watch your videos for fun you make learning so easy and fun thank you so much,2
the best part about his style of teaching is the storyline and narrative visuals he doesn t just point out and explain he makes you understand the whole biological process regardless how abstract the concept is he paints a picture that you will remember and that in itself is a true talent,2
im a dentist passed my boards years ago and am fully licensed but man i feel like a student all over again this is a phenomenal presentation and a great review i hope you consider becoming a university professor one day i like studying usmle material to make me a better overall provider in case you may wonder why a dentist would be on this video,2
i need his enthusiasm for my studies his passion for medical science is contagious and so his happiness while explaining concepts how even the most complex of topics start appearing lucid such a kind soul i owe him so much,2
hi i am a med school student and i hadnt been able to grasp the whole concept for my bioscience class until now just wanted to thank you for helping me prepare for my final exam which is coming soon,2
believe memy teacher has taught me on this topic hours ago i really looking for this video thank you from the core of my being zach thank to ninja nerd team,2
st year med student here and a big thank you for all the effort around embryology biochemistry and even in phisyology you are really making it easier and i am really thankful much love and respect your nerd from egypt,2
this is the best lecture ever i had heard since my years right nowthankyou man,2
look i want to thank you to the infinity you have managed to make me love medicine with your fantastic explanations of things you are a wonderful lecturer keep going and remember that there are many people who appreciate what you are doing im a medical student by the way,2
when someone explains something with so much passion it makes the argument so much more interesting and easier to understand,2
this is literally an entire semester of a level evolutionary developmental biology course summed up in a minute song fucking legendary,0
biology aside someone has to mention how absolutely insane this acapella is musically he is not using any external instruments apart from his damn mouth absolutely incredible,0
i still get shivvers from how good this is years later,2
this is a masterpiece and must be protected for future generations,2
this song is fuckin legendary its been years and i still cant get it to stop playing in my mind at totally random times i sometimes shout signal signal or hum random parts of the song while reading this song is like the genetic code itself tightly packed with the entire summary of evolutionary and developmental biology in a few minutes i was starting out with embryology when this song came out and this made me understand the genetic regulation part so well still waiting for some more amazing songs like this one this is still my favorite though it was my ringtone for a year,2
this is such a great song i can t imagine the amount of effort put into this video i remember watching this at school two years ago my science teacher would randomly play your videos in class sometimes this deserves so much more attention love the content on here keep going,2
this is so incredible the fact that he can put all these talents into one the singing the acappella the scientific knowledge the brilliantly clever song writing literally amazing,2
back before we blew up the cambrian like a bomb bomb shoutout to the precambrian explosion,0
finally someone translated despacito to english im pretty sure the translation is very accurate,2
seeing biological ideas combine so flawlessly in this video is so fascinating i dont know how to explain the feeling this video gave but the complexity and the connections are displayed in such a magnificent way far better than my textbook that i feel reinvigorated to learn biology once again with ferver,2
why recreate adversity im definitely part of that subgroup against bonsai its crippling trees for just aesthetics and theres also some weird control issues to unpack around it just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife,0
people like to talk about torturing trees like they dont cut their grass every week,0
i like the part that bonsai tree can grow big if allowed and can still make fruitseed so we could theoretically save endangered giant trees by making bonsais of them and have a hope that one day there will be place where they can their offspring can grow big again,2
there are also natural bonsai they form in small pockets of soil on certain rock formations and are really rare,1
so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree happier when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn t care another answer would be we have no way of knowing people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they satisfied being the tree that they are i don t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn t anthromorphise their idea of succes and satisfaction onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don t need it the trees definitely don t need it either,0
trees never ask for a lighter burden only for broader shoulders now thats an inspirational quote,2
to the people saying that growing bonsais is torture i just want to say that many of the training methods are also applies in other tree nurseries where the trees for parks streets and gardens are grown they are repotted pruned the roots too wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape of course it isnt neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger but as long as they are kept healthy i dont see a problem with it i think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings,1
bonzai shows that life can be beautiful within the struggle im having rough times lately feels like giving up at times this quote really cheers me up,2
theres no way you could assume that its doing actual harm to the tree after all you reassure the plant has got all it needs to survive and actually flourish on a smaller scale since youre eliminating the constant struggle for survival that happens in nature,1
bonsai are also easier to store than a fully grown tree so it playes a part in preservation you could have a full metal rack of bonsai but not a single full tree would fit there,1
dear hank thank you for teaching my ap bio class because you do one hell of a lot better job than my teacher,2
god created linneaus organsized nailed it carl,1
i would just like to take a moment to thank hank and the rest of the crashcourse team for helping me pass my classes this semester i couldnt have done it without yall,2
hank great video as always one question you seemed to make a point of mentioning more than once that protists are unicellular yet i was under the impression that protists being the grey area they are as you mentioned include all eukaryotes that are considered neither animalia plantae nor fungi i was also under the impression that some of these protista are indeed multicellular kevin,2
thanks for making these interesting videos i have a question what about viruses do they also go into the same system or are they outside it,2
reading bill bryson a a short history of nearly everything had to pull out my microbiology with taxonomy textbook thank you for your detailed presentations they are helping immensely with understanding this tip of the iceberg,2
thank you hank for acknowledging the constant change in our understanding of the world it amazes me that even just years after this video went up the taxonomic system has changed so much that my college biology of organisms course has to teach an entirely new classification science has made a victory in the description of supergroups and the integration of the meltingpot that was kingdom protista into groups which better fit their traits and evolution just as you hinted might be a good idea,2
hi i love crash course been using it since rd grade and now in th and still using it this is my first year in a middle school where we do midterms and crash course has helped me prepare for history physics biology and chemistry so thank you so much for the videos and plz make one for the macromolecules of life and characteristics of life thank you,2
thank you so much for making these they have helped me so much with my bio class,2
that was a great video i wish you were my teacher or my daughters teacher you make it fun and keep us interested throughout thank you hank,2
direct link to the full video on patreon,1
he literally explained speedvelocity and distancedisplacement in minutes i need him to be our physics teacher right now,2
distance and displacement speed speed and velocity average speed and average velocity acceleration gravitational acceleration projectile motion newtons st law newtons nd law,1
that moment when you learn more in youtube for free than your professors,2
this will save someones semester early if they see it right now,2
you have taught me more in minutes than my physics teacher has taught me in a year thank you,2
taking physics this upcoming fall semester have zero idea about what im getting myself into im shaky in math i figured id get a head start thank you,2
this video is the very meaning of not all heroes wear capes because this mans is my hero and i appreciate the heck out of this youtube channel thank you so much for all your hard work,2
i am literally years old and i can understand his content better than all of my books textbooks teachers and schools this guy is truly a legend,2
this person delivers lessons perfectly and smoothly like a programmed robot if teachers were very competent like him people would love science and consider it just like a cake eating,2
hi guys we hope youre enjoying this doc we wanted to let you know that weve released a new video just in time to celebrate the st anniversary of the first moon landing if thats your cup of tea,2
i love how you explain everything with physical examples that makes it easier to understand keep the good work and please continue sharing the discoveries made about quantum mechanics,2
this is truly going down a rabbit hole i cant imagine the number of experiments that would have to be conducted to make such discoveries and the amount of note taking and record this is brilliant you have to be different to be able to carry on trying new way of doing things,2
amazing documentary things like this always blows my mind and enables me to think widely and at the end of a topic when i learn something new and astonishing i cant help but smile bcs these are so amusing also huge respect to the scientists who are able to think and invent and see the world is such different perspectives they inspire me a lot,2
this is amazing i love the unique style of presentation thank you for simplifying the entire concept of quantum mechanics,2
mindblowing confusing enchantingreally love your efforts to help us understand the utterly confusing quantum world,2
brilliant documentary jim alkhalili is an incredible presenter it so impressive how he manages to communicate this immensely complicated stuff in a way that people actually can understand it,2
the doc is absolutely brilliant and an eyeopener thank you for it and more please many thanks,2
i have watched this video for the rd time and it still fascinates me how there are still so much to learn about our world this is the first ever video that has introduced me to watching the intriguing explanations of quantum mechanics that now it has become my hobby during past time unfortunately since i am on a different profession this will just be a hobby i really wish i could dig deep into the rabbits hole kudos to jim alkhalili and spark for keeping it simple and mind blowing,2
i am so unbelievably happy ans i havent even watched part ii i mean i know how it ends maybe i graduated in it but this is how you should teach physics to students this is entertaining its simple but extremely detailed and understandable at all levels you wont get a class of teens looking at you like youre reciting the bible in latin backwards and then an average c score at the end this is what physics is fun endless thinking endless possibilities endless learning physics is the language of existence and we are just toddlers slowly navigating our ways through learning the abcs of it at any given point in time this is life teaching us theres nothing better than this nothing yeh,2
for those that want more in depth information on some of the subjects i talked about in this video here are some detailed videos i made newtons law of universal gravitation entropy electromagnetism and the speed of light special relativity einsteins general relativity quantum mechanics basics extra credit fundamental forces of nature,1
well if your going to teach physics you gotta start from the beginning it s a warm summer evening in ancient greece,1
physics is not about remembering physics is about concept walter lewin,1
duuuuude for years and years i never understood why time slows down when you move faster your diagram with the two flashlight beams completely cleared it up subscribed,1
im late to this party but i wanted to let you know that your explanation of relativity and the graphic of the two trains has helped more of my physics students than any thing else i have come across simple elegant and accessible thanks for the great videos,2
i like how he explains the speed of light at the speed of light,2
this is exceptionally explained i was also a student of physics and can somewhat understand the complexities involved i only wish that he should have taken half an hour instead of minutes hats off to you sir and thanks,2
really a video worth watching whenever i feel really negative about physics being attacked always by the odds in classrooms and exams this video heals me though i watch i cant understand all of themhope to understand in the near future,2
your explanatory description for the general relativity theory is phenomenal it solved a long time confusion for me thank you,2
i never truly understood the difference between weight and mass until i heard your explanation thank you,2
time crystals have got to be one of the coolest scientific names given to an object,2
i love how the scientist explained what sigma represents in a coin toss its much more easy to understand and i think if he didnt i would certainly be confused its always great to translate these discoveries into something more people can reach,2
its so awesome that they managed to find a way to legitimately call something a time crystal,2
quanta first video i watch of yours and i gotta say im very impressed you dumb down sophisticated subjects adequately like not condensending and not too high level props to your script writer this is not easy so gj your community is respectful and curious and i thoroughly enjoy this corner of the internet im going to check out a couple more of your vids and if its the same story you earned yourself a sub thank you and keep it up,2
time crystal just doesnt consume energy like any atom for example perpetual motion machine generates energy from nothing the idea of the time crystal is not that its perpetual motion machine or breaks some physics law but that this is periodic motion without losing energy we knew the possibility of such motion with super fluids and other exotic states for a while but this is the first legit exactly zero energy loss demonstration,1
this is beautiful this video implicitly tells you that how science works science doesn t always comprise of eureka moments often scientists slog through different inconsistencies assumptions and opposing theories to purport a hypothesis,2
its amazing to see how much we still have to learn,2
thanks for creating this site although i am a retired physicist it is exciting to read about what discoveries are being made particularly in quantum world,2
thank you so much quanta magazine to fill young hearts with this deep inquisitiveness and fascination with the reality around the true potential of the platform is limitless this epic summary just resonates so many unexplained questions than i had the time before,2
people overlook physics too much this is where the cool stuff comes from,2
math also called the language of physics so in fact i think the real reason for me to learn physics is its concepts,1
you speak so fluidly like a natural cant wait to see what is in store for the future of your channel,2
thank you i am writing a book and i needed some basic instruction on physics i look forward to more of your lessons,2
in the first seconds ive learned something important thank you you are a wise teacher i am grateful for the opportunity to learn,2
no one chemist ill just throw acid on a gas vehicle,0
this channel helped me get an a in physics your time is truly worth it for these videos,2
i will be taking physics in my sophomore year next year and i really like this video now i can somewhat expect the things i would have to interpret next year,2
i used to think that complicated math is useless but im starting to get the point now thank you,1
good video but small trifle at around friction should be pointing to the left since friction always opposes the direction of motion of an object in contact with another object,1
thank you very much for a simple intro to a described complex subject i look forward to watching more of your videos so i can understand this unique language of physics,2
heisenberg also wrote what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning,1
this is the kind of physics i understand it makes sense that physics is a model of our perception of the world and not the world itself the map is not the territory,1
as a programmer this was the most intuitively understandable episode in years of pbs spacetime,2
cant help but quote douglas adams there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory which states that this has already happened,0
everyone is always asking what is physics no one is ever asking how is physics doing,1
is it possible that the reason why we cant answer the two questions are you a particle at the same time as are you a wave is because we are not asking the question correctly perhaps when we find the singular question that captures both of those questions we will understand that it isnt a duality but something else,1
sending the electron through a magnetic field doesnt seem like asking are you spin up or down but rather will you orient yourself up or down when subjected to this field and it seems logical that the leftright alignment would be random after that since then youre asking will you orient yourself left of right when subjected to this orthogonal field anyway taking this sort of observer centric view probably often leads one to boltzmann brains and other rather useless hypersimplified things,0
nice to see that kants take on epistemology that our knowledge of reality can be defined only as phenomenal or relating to our experiences senses and how our mind organizes information as opposed to noumenal or relating to fundamentally direct knowledge about reality itself still seems to be floating on gracefully for anything dealing with the actual nature of reality time to visit your local metaphysician unfortunately any statement from a metaphysician can only really be speculation and language games so alas,1
this episode was such a pay off for those of us who have been on this journey of discovery with space time from the beginning it feels like season finale of the th season of a show where it basically explains that everything you thought was important was actually meaningless and that the acceptance of this fact is actually the point,2
what this all suggests to me is that the physical reality behind quantum mechanics is explicitly nonlocal eg bohmian mechanics and it is the process of gathering information about a system that imposes locality that is gathering information is an inherently local process,1
a literal genius asking what is omg is exactly the situation i needed to see,2
i used to see this guy on every space and universe documentary in the s glad hes still going full swing,2
he is so genius that even the omg was beyond for his learning,2
was einstein wrong with theory of relativity michio yes and no spoken like a true quantum physicist,1
i just cant get my head around about how insanely lucky we are to have such amazing people talking to us through the internet i know this video is a bit older so who cares but that was a thought that constantly went through my head while watching this,2
this dude has the most stereotypical scientist hair and i love it,2
hes such a great science communicator were lucky to have him,2
theres no such thing as dumb question i hope a lot of people especially teachers understand this,2
i love how he says theres a nobel prize waiting to find that answer like hes telling us to not fear math or physics and give it s try haha i love it,2
string theory could not be more simplified than this not all genius minds can teach well his students are lucky,2
this is how you teach and speak about a subject when you have mastered it so interesting stimulating and easy to follow most high school teachers are not experts and have not mastered their craft this is one issue with public education and kids get turned off and tune outthen land here and are again inspired and motivated to learn again,1
i m eleven years old and wanting to get a start on physics early to get into a good college and this is precisely the thing i am looking for thank you so much,2
this is so much better than it was in school,2
me failing math also me i m gonna be a physicist,1
i love the way you explain all of this thank you so much for sharing this and explaining so well for the motivational words you throw in while you explain i learn so much with your videos and wanted to express my gratitude please don t stop making videos,2
you are amazing currently taking physics in my senior year of college and got a professor who is new at teaching soso confusing but you explain it so well,2
we live in a privileged age where we have the benefit of massive accumalated knowledge of the generations before us,2
ive never felt like physics is so approachable until watching this video great content,2
years old and well versed in physics this was engaging to me even though i already knew the info and that shows how well this man teaches future bookmark for home schooling my kids,2
very motivating introduction to physics,2
you re smarter than me kid yeah,1
dad so what did the physics man teach you son child nothing that i didnt know already,1
bro the year old is literally smarter than the whole twitter community,1
im a physics graduate and watching the experts discussions made me feel like sht the more you learn the more you realize how much you actually dont know,0
the first kid in this video is way beyond most kids with his ability to understand abstract concepts the fact he was able to answer some of those questions was really impressive and not at all typical,2
they cheated by hiring the smartest yearold they could find,0
you don t understand anything until you re able to explain it to someone who s never studied it this guy understands it,1
that ending blew my mind the fact that our universe brane could intersect or wrap etc with other three dimensional universes to produce fourdimensional ones makes sense how do you form a cube with a bunch of slices of squares how do you form four dimensions with a bunch of slices of threedimensional branes,1
the kid explained physics very well for that man glad he shared his knowledge,2
all of these people are very well educated for their respective maturity groups the year old is very bright the teenager is wise beyond her years and the college student guy had some encouraging curiosity,2
im curious to see what will be added to that map in years,1
as an astronomy major and studying astrophysics this makes me more excited in the field im currently learning,2
physicists are not quittersyouve saved my life,2
i loved this it was very informative and a great overview could you perhaps do a map of engineering too,2
fun fact my school has this poster in their physics class i saw it was from youtube and searched it,2
i know theyre all science subjects and ive found them genuinely very very helpful so i was just wondering if youve ever thought about making a map for business or economics or well commerce students im in the middle of shifting from sci to commerce depending on my exam results that is but ive loved all of your maps thus far so id really appreciate it if you ever make a video on business management or banking or stocks or anything along those lines just a tiny suggestion,2
this is the most interesting video i have ever watched about physics in general thank you,2
i love physics i cant express it in words,2
its one of the most interesting videos that ive ever seen in my life i wanted to get an idea a kind of overview of the laws of our physical reality being represented as a total picture which youve rightly named as the map of physics and youve shown it wonderfully in your video im very thankful grateful to you for enlightening us with the gift of knowledge in such an orderly interesting form in its totality and many thanks to you for adding philosophy to its end for addressing the unending quests of mankind for the unknown unknowable truths,2
ive studied a bit of all sorts of physics quantum physics classical and relativistic physics regarding nuclear energy and radioactive decay but ive noticed that the classical physics of nyoton is still the hardest for me especially the motion of liquids and solid objects like projectiles,0
in a parallel universe worthless neil would be watching me explaining quantum mechanics,1
watching neil keeps my mind open to possibilities,2
this man can make anything fascinating and make me want to listen to him,2
the only reason i wanted to learn more about quantum physics is because i was listening to dr tyson s podcast where he mentioned quantum entanglement and that einstein didn t think it was a thing calling it spooky action at a distance now my brain is a contradiction in terms in that i m mathematically challenged seriously algebra might as well be sandscript but i understand calculus i ve never found anyone that explain this to me lol so when dr tyson was explaining quantum entanglement i got the concept but i needed more info like trying to understand how an engine works by looking at the fuel fill and exhaust pipe and i know i m just some guy but after reading everything i could get my hands on that wasn t written for phd candidates it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars my physics teacher in hs said that the only natural force that humans can t manipulate is gravity and we d have to be able to manipulate it if we ever want to explore other solar systems but excuse my ignorance if we can figure out how to manipulate quantum entanglement we would have the means to sidestep the cosmic speed limit,1
some day well laugh at ourselves for being so puzzled by quantum physics,1
i got addicted scratching my head watching videos related to quantum mechanics,2
ndt you cant get crazier than quantum mechanics my girlfriend hold my beer,1
this is amazing i m so excited for the future of these science discoveries,2
quantum entanglement kinda sounds like that if a tree falls in the woods with no one around does it make a sound question except the answer is that it both does and doesnt untill you hear it,1
the universe is fractal therefore the same rules that apply to a solar system must apply to an atom except at faster speeds otherwise the universe would collapse in disarray and conflict empirical observations of the micro universe are as good as the equipment utilized to collect them if one observes a particle planet around the nucleus sun with a shutter speed equal to one revolution it would register at one position only cycle would result in two opposite positions at higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration wave function starts to reveal itself what is missing in our science at the particle level is the inclusion of the interaction between the particle and the energy dissipated from the device used to observe it equipment or human brain,1
professor kaku i m so glad he was asked to explain this for us i am also excited that cnn is talking about this it s what we should spend more time talking about fascinating things like this,2
in my physic class the professor said just perhaps someday we may know of there are other planets besides those our solar system now we know of over,1
i wish stephen hawking was still alive to hear this,1
how wonderful to hear from a physicist about the new information about planets in our system and seeing planets in other galaxies my late father who was a farmer in the midwest would come into the house from the fields to watch nasa rocket deployments and returns oh how he would have loved this new exploration thank you,2
he always sounds so excited about what hes talking about now that is passion,2
i always love listening to prof kaku he always does such a great job at explaining difficult concepts in ways that can be understood by the interested layperson like me and his passion and enthusiasm are always contagious,2
this was awesome more please,2
up until now i was not impressed but now whoa this picture is amazing,2
it s hard to believe it s been five years since the president of the united states stared at an eclipse twice,0
thats a great explanation thank you professor,2
science should not be about whether you are good at it or not it should only be about whether you are interested,1
quantum physics for year olds year old me sounds good,2
this talk was very healing for me i had some difficult experiences with science as a middle schooler i was placed in advanced english and science classes but i never really got science i was made fun of by my teacher from that experience i came to believe that me and science dont mix but now that im older i realize i do love science when its explained well and when it relates to something i care about i really do want to learn about quantum physics but have been intimidated about where to start your simple little explanations opened a door for me dominic i send you love and appreciation across the quantum waves,2
if you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough einstein,1
this guy must know some really smart year olds,2
quantum physics quantum physics the description of the smallest particles in life and how they interact with light particlewave duality ex bouncy ball drops into water and creates ripples ripples reach a stick and fade out bouncy ball suddenly pops out again from nearby the stick quantum tunneling ex bouncy ball on a window ex hydrogen tunneling releases sunlight superposition ex spinning in both directions ex mri machine spins our hydrogen atoms in both directions silicone chip lasers nuclear powerplants principles of teaching start off in the right place explain the info in the terms that they already understand start with an explanation and ask if it makes sense dont go too far down the rabbit hole its better to explain a small amount that they will understand than make everything confusing clarity beats accuracy a simpler explanation gets the point across explain why you think its cool show your enthusiasm for the subject or give examples of how its relevant to their lives,1
after watching this i realize i m only six years old,1
four principles of technical communication start at the right point from known to unknown show of hands err on the side of caution dont go too far into the rabbit hole explain things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information clarity is better than accuracy iron out the finer details later explain why it is cool enthusiasm is key most importantly convey it is not about whether you are good or bad at it it is all about being interested in it,2
i wish my physics teacher was like him it doesn t matter if you re good at it all that matters is that you have interest,2
hes so humble wish my teachers were like him,2
the hardest part of that first trick is wrestling a cane away from an old lady at the park theyre deceptively strong,1
my take probably messed some up the cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form your finger than the heavier side so that finger moves faster towards the com of the cane this causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass the phone is not evenly weighed so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize right well the same effect is observed when spinning a brick it fell on my foot twice while i tested that that i played around with i believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brickphone is in the middle of the whole object so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the com will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum the spin is easier on the other hand spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy so this state is unstable the phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate which is a more stable state rhyme unintended the same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending your hands out which causes you to decelerate this one is a bit of a troll i tested deuterium water and distilled water and the distilled one produced no less effect it s not the water that is attracted to the cup it s the stuff in it ions the cereal contains some iron which is magnetic this makes it attracted to the magnet maybe but what is interesting is that water and glass fex are pushed away by magnets it s diamagnetic anyways maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into i did not observe one i do not know but i did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor hot air rises as the hot air creates a rising bubble the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away when it gets light enough it slowly flies up hope i am correct hand have a nice day edit watched the answers video,1
how does this work hmm i dont know why dont you tell m number two,0
the last one is very cool i got hold of out of date teabags and brought them in to science club thank you for the awesome ideas,2
this is actually one of traditional games in my country but normally we use an oil paper or newspaper first we glue every end of corner each other then we make a little hole at the center by using a needle then we blow the paper from the hole until it expands like a pillow finally we light every corner of the pillow paper at the same time it will fly and look like a japanese fireball ghost in the sky,1
also for all you wouldbe explainers works for perfectly symmetric objects in a vacuum,1
the reason why works isn t just because of the method but because in the first case you only have one finger the center of mass is always a point and since you ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane there is effectively a chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point and thus starts leaning towards one side or another if you use the second method there s two points of contact and thus as long as the center of mass is inbetween it cannot tilt you can try finding the center of mass on your own with two fingers together without using the special method and just doing it normally and you ll see it works fine tldr you don t need a special method to balance on the center of mass you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between,1
might have something to do with the th phase of water its a relatively newly discovered phenomena that negatively charged particles inside of water seem to cluster close to nonwater surfaces theres a chargeless layer after that and then a layer of positive charge which creates a natural bipole which could act as a magnet when stimulated with another magnet and basically push the cereal along and possibly even as work as a battery as the scientist explaining it pointed out im no expert obviously but there was a ted talk that i watched on youtube on the topic which was fascinating i suggest you look it up,1
first one works thanks to friction when the imbalance occurs friction cancels out the speeds on each side which kind of forces you to move them accordingly so that the momentum on the sides are equal,1
on the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced this should work as long as each hand is moving at relatively the same speed the same force and there isnt any other significant variables,2
teaching bleedingedge science to a general audience me without making it feel watered down is done nowhere else as well as here thanks to all involved,2
years ago i was a physics major life didnt turn out the way i initially expected and now im in cs classes including theory of computation this video is very much the intersection of stuff ive studiedstudying and hits hard,0
this sounds reminiscent of g dels incompleteness theorem he was able to abstract away the mathematical operations and describe any possible equation as a binary choice between it being true or false much like how the counterfactuals are either possible or impossible and allow you to ignore the specific equations themselves,1
it would definitely revolutionize how science is taught in schools anyway whether it is the all in one thing that ties them together or not it could be incredibly useful as a learning tool,2
so if i understand constructor theory correctly in this world there are only two laws that matter what a man can do and what a man cant captain jack sparrow a physicist ahead of his time,1
it strikes me that as a layman typically in physics theres only one or two right answers about how a system can evolve seeing as this is something of an epistemological framework i like epistemology and theyre important for getting new perspectives and theres a functionally infinite expansion of the number of ways a complex system can evolve im struggling to see how were going to find this needle in a haystack of cans and cants that is without lots and lots of ways to generate new ideas about how the system will evolve and new razors for eliminating impossible actions,1
wouldnt constructor theory fundamentally be assuming we know all the base sets of rules in order to be correct otherwise it could rule out things that are possible but they just dont have a truth statement for in the base set of rules,1
this is the best explanation of counterfactuals and constructor theory ive seen i am sure a lot of good work went in to making it so simple to understand thank you,2
i very often find myself not wondering what david deutsch is up to these days and i would be entirely happy to hear about constructor theory after it has accomplished some accomplishments or gathered some buyin within the discipline instead of as currently seems to be the case before,2
weve had an algebra of possibility for over years its called modal logic and the standardly used semantics for it is possible worlds semantics also known as kripke semantics it has its own operators theorems etc and is used extensively in philosophy,1
hope this will make your life easier unit conversion metric system distance displacement average speed velocity acceleration kinematics vectors projectile motion newtons law force friction mass weight energy work circular motion gravitational acceleration centripetal force tension force momentum impulse inelastic elastic colltion rotational motion,2
people who take time out of their lives to make this much content over challenging subjects are the greatest types of people on the planet idk who runs this but i cannot express how thankful i am for them to get this type of assistance from a real person id be paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars to learn the same thing i actually watch these videos on spring break for the joy of simply learning thank you,2
lets help this guy by not skipping on the ads and subscribe to his channel im preparing for my board exams in electro engineering and this helps me really alot thank you man,2
i cant begin to describe how frustrated and hopelessly lost i felt trying to learn physics the first time around if it wasnt for your videos and help i dont think i could stay within my major your work is absolutely invaluable and your videos are actually life changing for me i cant afford tutors but these videos give me a real fighting chance to achieve all of my educational goals thank you so so so so much you are an absolute gem and i hope you know how much we all appreciate you,2
my professor uses your videos to teach us during online class it has come to the point that we recognize you as our professor more thanks for your vids,2
i just wanted to say that your physics playlist helped me immensely to get a on the ap physics c mechanics exam your videos are a godsend and i extremely appreciate all the work you put into them ill definitely be revisiting this channel during college,2
is it weird that its one of the goals of my life to meet this person just so much that he helped me a lot during a lot of hard times words arent enough to express how grateful i am and blessed are we to have someone like this amazing person teach his knowledge for free and continues to do so i salute you sir thank you for helping me out through times,2
this kind of youtube channel deserves an award for the effort and time the creator has put in to help students great summary and review i salute you sir btw ill be taking soon may nmat exam for medicine goodluck to mee,2
a mistake at it was meant to be m on the incline instead of m but overall i get the way it work and good explations thanks alot,2
bless your soul man you are a time saver rather than doing a time consuming note reading i just listen to you and its already summarized,2
welcome to physics the more we learn the less we know,1
all these will eventually boil down to attempts to beat the speed of light,1
einstein would be impressed,2
i m just curious to see where we re gonna be in years,1
it looks like they are creating roadways for space or wormholes,1
what caused the big bang cern,1
real reasons our eletric bills are so high,0
all i got out of this is our electric bills will never be free,0
what if what inside a hydron collider,1
i was attacked by ceti years ago trying to prove that there were aliens,0
can we all take a moment to appreciate this fly flying through the ring in slomo,2
i have a pretty big physics problem that has perplexed me my whole life the closest supermarket from where i live is meters roughly and it takes me minutes to walk there and back at a walking speed of kph mph the problem is it has taken my father years to make this trip and i want to know how this strange phenomenon has occurred,0
when i was a kid i discovered that you could stand up a straw in a glass of soda pop and miraculously soda would come out of the top of the straw slowly like a tiny fountain back in those says the straws were all paper you have shown me the answer to this phenomena and i thank you,2
the slowmo audio of the ring falling down the chain has to be one of the most satisfying sounds ive heard,2
ive learned the flicking the bottlecan trick a while ago like years ago and only learned today why that works thanks a lot,2
imagine writing a paper that can be disproven by attaching a pressure gage to the bottle,1
one of the only things i still remember from high school physicsshaking the bottle doesnt increase the pressure it allows the gas to more easily separate from the liquid,1
when looking at the salt water glass around time index if you look carefully you can see a difference in the layers between the fresh water from the ice cube and the salt water that the ice cube is floating in,1
i think it would be cool to see how the results of the ice experiment varies when you use a fresh water ice cube in the fresh water glass and a salt water ice cube in the salt water glass you can also test using salt water cubes in both glasses and compare all the combinations very nice video,2
i thoroughly enjoyed this science talk and learnt quite a lot then i would in class thank you now onto your next video as i down my nonequilibrium beverage,2
ohhhhh my god i wait for these episodes like most people wait for the next tom cruise movie thank god for brian greene for showing us the beauty of physics,2
so great to see leonard susskind on air this is how physics should be presented no egos no showboating just great minds discussing complex concepts that us mere mortals can begin to understand,2
seriously thank you i particularly am sad that i never pursuid physics in my higher education as these are the subjects that bring colour to my life i think it might not be praised enough that we still get to learn about these amazing ideas even more so from the most incredible field experts for free from anywhere in the world i would like to take these few minutes to show my gratitude towards these actions and to professor brian greene thank you all for your contributions looking for answers or more questions and communicating us the findings forever grateful,2
i loved when you take a glance at mark listening to leonard speak because he just has the biggest smile on his face you can tell how much respect everyone has for each other and their individual interpretations this was a phenomenal listen and i can t wait for more,2
yet another marvelous production from the world science festival i wait for every new episode as if sitting at the edge of my seat as these brilliant hardworking individuals reveal more details about the saga we call life thank you so much brian greene for taking the time to help connect us with all of this valuable insight,2
thank you brian and everyone behind the scenes who make wsf you are doing a great service,2
i hope to see more of ana i can imagine discussing concepts like this in depth in your non native language would be extremely difficult but i also think that in situations like that the different viewing angle can be very revealing for example there are words in native cultures languages that describe entire concepts in the english language and vice versa sometimes things that are hidden from one perspective become obvious when looked at from another because parallels between concepts emerge beyond the language itself i think i may have just broken my brain hahaha anyway i love these thanks to everyone who was on it and of course brian,1
i was gratified enticed by dr susskind s implication of the time shear near the event horizoneh because it supports questions i have been asking for years about the structure of a black hole which is commonly dismissed as an unexplainable singularity at the center of the eh that i have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering i note that feynmans qed is not actually sensible explanatory or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive this vid also illuminated for me the ubiquitous hairiness of the universe as a thick tangle of erepr entanglement filaments stretched in at least d by an infinitude of time sheared partners i think this makes the universe a relatively big but very tiny place,1
please keep these amazing episodes coming brian greene is so good at bringing everything and everyone together to present these amazing theories to all compelling with stellar production more please,2
brian is just incredible i loved physics growing up and wanted to be a quantum physicist but also loved medicine and became a doctor but my heart feels alive when i read any papers on quantum physics and attend such lectures may be one day i will become physicist for now i learn through such amazing videos and papers thanks so so much,2
which basic concepts of physics would you like to learn more about,1
physicists are made of atoms a physicist is an attempt by an atom to understand itself michio kaku,1
i love you and your books mr kaku im almost clueless when it comes to physics but your books are so well written that i could understand the concept to some extent i am easily hooked on reading every line in your books because they all are intriguing thank you and wish you everything,2
michio is such a gem for the world pushing our minds is always a good thing i dont understand most of his ideas but i try it he is so inspirational,2
it only took one year of physics at uni to demonstrate to me that i would be better off studying biological sciences the mind of a high level physicist is an awesome and occasionally strange thing to behold when it is on display i have great respect for any scientist who is also an educator,2
thank you for finally explaining string theory in words a nonphysics person as myself could understand now maybe you could explain why it isn t called vibration theory i believe with that i would have been more accepting of what you said today years ago,2
i remember watching michio kakus shows on discovery science as a kid he made me interested in science and i probably learned english from those shows and if i traveled back in time to close the tv then its likely i wouldnt go back to being an engineer im a little sad to see him getting older years later but im glad that he is as passionate about string theory as ever its funny how some people can change your life without them ever knowing,2
i have a theory that i would like to get out if this is the leading theory we are to accept you inspired me when i was a young child michio kaku i read your book hyperspace when i was about and it changed my life i have since been building upon many theories of many great minds such as yourself and i think i have discovered something that i feel i should go public with as soon as possible ive never written a book before it is intimidating and one day i hope to have your blessing because without you i may have never come to these ideas and even within my theory there is a place for string theory as it embodies such a theory in a way i hope to meet you one day thank you for everything,2
as history goes all that was once a theoryhypothesisdream has been turning out to be possible in more than one occasion kudos to you professor kaku,2
dr kaku nice to see you still educating us on the exciting elements of life in the universe you and i met in december of when i was a producer at fox news channel working on our y k special the program focusing on what the future held for humankind was a big success and in my opinion you were the star,2
this dude makes it look easy respect,2
he repeats his stories alot and tbh i think thats what made him such a good explainer he hones the same explanation until he masters it and finally blesses us young minds,2
ive been following mr kaku for nearly years now and he is still till this very day the best professor i have ever seen anywhere he influenced more young brains than people give him credit for people who will unlock the secrets of dark matter and so on will be people who were influenced by this man at some point in their life and thats amazing this man is perfect thank you sir professor michio kaku,2
he makes everything seem so evident and easy im glad to be born in a period where this man exists,2
this was the most comprehensible and engaging physics lesson i ve ever witnessed the realization that the big bang was the fissioning of universes wow and i actually understood the description of worm holes incredible knowledge and presentation,2
i have been a fan of dr kaku for decades his knack for breaking down complex subjects into easily understandable terms combined with a refreshing sense of humor makes dr kaku a natural teacher and a pleasure to listen to,2
i would like to say thank you to all of the historical pioneers that have discovered the building blocks of bothscience and mathematics each of you are brilliant shining stars,2
this guy never fails to make me feel like im learning something while also teaching absolutely nothing new and simply conceptualizing every sentence,2
michio kaku maybe the most captivating educator i have ever listened to he is one of very few who make it a sheer joy to learn how to understand things,2
should i upload daily also make sure to like the video and subscribe,2
he s rich but can t afford better quality lol,0
i love how he said his controller cost k but you can get it at games stop for bucks,2
editor how much fake do you want physics yes,1
he s yelling so loud he doesn t even notice,1
this acting is top quality and i started laughing when he says this game play is about to crazy,2
no one absolutely no one physicsuses shotgun far range,1
how is he spinning with a keyboard,1
i love how he sounds like a year old when he says i got him,2
he saidill give him if he gets more kills then me those are ones my dude,1
hi everybody i cant be online on saturday when this video goes live but ill check in later in the evening to reply to comments watch out for our second video today at pm,2
neutrinos are what got me into physics when i was years old and the more i learn about them the more fascinating they become,2
neutrino oscillations might sound somewhat mysterious but really its just linear algebra complex numbers unitary matrices eigenvectors and so on she always makes me smile,2
i remember reading about neutrinos years ago they had just built neutrino detectors and had calculated the predicted number of events from solar neutrinos the estimates were off by they had not hypothesized the neutrino mixing at that time,1
a thing i found amazing is that something like of the energy from a nuclear reactor is carried away by the neutrinos it radiates,2
thank you sabine i love when you go into this level of detail or more,2
sabine please keep making these videos about whats not known in physics its these types of things that can really drive a person to want to study the field i also appreciate you talking about situations where physics may be on the wrong track physics shouldnt be about jumping on the bandwagon of whats popular,1
ahhh problems with the standard model whod have guessed i had some wonderful arguments with particle physicists while living near cern a few years back but ive had problems with this particular theory since the copenhagen interpretation of the s,0
thank you sabine so we ll thought out and executed my mind expands every time i hear you explain,2
i really enjoy many of sabines videos very informative its great to have critical thinkers for these complex issues she can be a great debunker as well she seems very objective and unafraid to step on anyones toes,2
giving away right now to enter just use code physics in fortnite item shop,1
i feel terrible for bob he sounds like he s crying like prayer for bob,0
this guy is and talks very good im straight up crying for him,2
she was my life she filled my soul she was part of my heart all this coming from a year old im years old and i dont even have a friend thats a girl,0
its not about money its about true love,2
ok i normally find it funny when someone asks what a gold digger is even when he s but this time i just didn t laugh he sounds like a good kid man,2
bob sounds coco sounds aidie sounds,1
u r a gift from god this is the first video i watched on your channel and i want to let you know that i wish you a prosperous life filled with joy and happiness with fun times god bless you physicss,2
i feel so bad for that kid he s cute and i and i hope he keeps up the good work and lives a happy long life i hope you has a good life,2
yo you helping this kid is the best thing on youtube,2
this is the kind of content that has a real impact on the current revolution in the online education clear eloquent well animated a real gem for curious minds thank you for doing this,2
when youtube search gives you exactly what you were looking for it s new it s long it s well explained finally some good youtube,2
as a physics student i have to say that this is an amazing introduction to the standard model this video deserves to be played at schools as part of their curriculum it explains all of the important aspects in a simple way that upcoming students can easily understand thank you for your contributions to science communication,2
less than halfway through the video and its already one of the bestexplained quantum physics videos ive ever seen,2
interestingly enough at high enough optical intensities beyond those attainable by current lasers it is possible for photons to interact with one another this study of photonphoton interactions is known as nonlinear optics for example two photons can combine to create a photon with twice as much energy however due to these high intensities not being common in daily life this isnt frequently observed outside of laboratories,1
ive been rewatching this for a while now its actually pretty interesting but im finding it hard to understand the leptons especially the lepton numbers symmetries and the neutrinos but except all that i understood the rest you really explained very well and you made it very comprehensive and detailed thanks very much,2
hey thanks for including the bit about the neutron lifetime question i have worked on the ucntau experiment and its nice to see this parameter mentioned as an important question for those curious the lifetime is believed to be around sec but the statistics are still underperforming and of course this result deviates from the older bottlebeam experiments by such a degree that there is not yet a consensus,1
the best explanation i have ever seen about the standard model congratulations,2
can you do a map of all simple groups in abstract algebra that would be awesome,2
i wish i had seen this years ago trying to visualize particle physics in my head has always been my stumbling block and this video just made it a whole lot easier,2
the fact that i learned more in this channel than in school is weird,1
i cant believe how perfectly timed this is with my current physics class,2
ive been doing thermodynamics in some way shape or form for three years now and this has been by far the best presentation for these concepts that ive come across thanks dr shini lecturers could literally spend two days explaining what she did in ten minutes in class you guys are awesome,2
i love everything about this video i wish my expensive classes were as entertaining and as cleverly put together,2
loving the series thank you for all your hard work,2
this is so helpful weve been doing thermodynamics as uni but i tend to sit in letcures with my eyes glazed over because i didnt fully understand the basics when we first learned them so anything more complicated is too confusing,2
this is honestly sooo helpful keep up the good work,2
thank you for this video i am taking thermodynamics right now and this is honestly a great review of all the basic thermo ideas,2
thx for this i have exam next week this is lifesaving but exam is just little more complex but it whould start me up realy good love this channel,2
physics is so interesting when you actually get to know and understand it i really want to sue all my school teachers for not doing their jobs correctly and for only scraping the surface when it comes to physics it really is just so frustrating when you are so interesting in something that you cant even understand properly,0
why not try skillshare totally free for one month,1
very cool stuff at first i thought they need to explain these effects verbally then i saw the written notes you have pointed out some very good examples of how physics can be weird and provided links and explanations for effects very good job,2
music that isnt obnoxious no numbers no annoying narrator actually pretty cool tricks not clickbait a my guys love it,2
i love these experiments so usable and functional for people in quarantine at home love it,2
a similar demonstration of the dropping magnet is a solid metal disk connected to a pivot so it swings through the jaws of a large powerful magnet the metal disk is not attracted to the magnet but when allowed to swing through the magnetic field its motion is slowed and almost stopped if a series of closely spaced slots are cut into the disk and the experiment repeated the disk swings through almost unhindered the slots disrupt the currents needed to generate the opposing magnetic field,1
i really enjoyed this video i love how it teach everything in a so simple and easy way and best of all its short and eyecatching,2
this is absolutely amazing thank you for explaining everything no numbers no annoying narrators and just actually being legit good people,2
thumbs up for a great video of really cool physics demonstrations an extra thumbs up for excellent explanations in the description well done,2
wow la verdad te felicito muy buenos trucos aprecio tambi n el hecho que hayas puesto subtitulos gracias,2
amazing love these videos and cant wait until my kids are a bit older so i can show them the beautiful world of science,2
after all the years i have been interested in physics i love finding out new things about how the discoveries were made and the people involved,2
amazing lecture suzie and excellent way of taking a stand on the nature of science and how we have used it and how we should use it you could have even talked more about the scientistcivilians sacrificing or loosing their lives after doing experiences with new inventions etc many lives were lost due the lack of safety issues back in the days or just due to not knowing all the side effects etc excellent job suzie i am very amazed by your work and by your wisdom,2
what a fantastic journey through the discovery of physics fascinating well done suzie for making a difficult subject to understand so accessible frankly i didnt think that this would be an easy watch but it was well explained and your excitement for science is quite infectious im looking forward to reading your book excelsior,2
outstanding lecture interesting and fun thank you,2
truly a remarkable presentation i read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model fundamentals the ten keys to reality by frank wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation there s also the book qed the strange theory of light and matter by richard p feynman which this video helps me visualize the xrays excitements these all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to what s left to discover well i position myself towards ligo virgo kagra into understanding gravity and gravitational waves of course education follows but for now i am currently reading a booklet called relativity the th anniversary as instructed i have not proceeded further until i am fully convinced on the requirement needed in chapter for the vitality of humankind,2
an excellent subject and lecture thank you,2
really inspiring talk thank you so much,2
very well presented and informative well done suzie and i will buy her book,2
what a great way of explaining with a love for the subject thank you,2
if i was to predict the future now id make future architecture look more like hobbit holes for rural areas and artificial hills with forestcover up top for the urban ones for we either manage to bring some space for nature back or we wont have a future,1
read more about d materials in charlie woods extended profile of jie shan and kin fai mak for quanta magazine,1
almost like theyre making their own fields and then creating particles by putting different levels of energy into those fields amazing,2
i saw a video by veritasium where he showed the moir lattice pattern he held two transparent sheets of a honeycombish pattern overlapping and i remember seeing the different shapes and structures emerging being completely fascinated i got way too excited about it and felt silly im a year old woman and i wanted to have these sheets myself to explore these patterns theyre beautiful i knew there was something to it and this video makes me very very happy cant wait to see more from this research and channel im a new subscriber,2
id love to see a more indepth video about the mechanics of how the stacked sheets create virtual atoms what are the limitations are there any conceivable functionalcommercial uses beyond research what an exciting development in physics research im surprised this is the first im hearing of this techniquetechnology,2
so many developments like this seem hypey but this one dropping to d is such a beautiful simplification lends itself to sanetime computer simulation the moir bit again beautiful reminds me a lot of xray crystallography maybe similar potential for discovering how stuff works,2
this channel is so high quality and criminally underwatched another a video,2
can someone explain something to me not a trained scientist how many of these virtual atoms can they manipulate at once are they able to scale the quantity up enough to make for instance clouds of virtual hydrogen helium etc,1
this was bound to happen next up d printing materials atom by atom and then mass production and what if you combined this d with penrose tiling patterns and stacked those what would the moir pattern look like,1
wow this feels like game changing research new technology here we come material sciences are fascinating,2
whoa i love this type of minimalist approach to problems in general its so elegant here very inspiring,2
humans are smart but i think we are really learning insight into our abilities when we try to understand what we perceive is the moon there when we dont look at it read about object permanence in psychology for instance there are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation we are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious even our inherent bias may get in the way and like any puzzle such as a sadoku we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back and finally it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics,2
there actually just has to be some sort of connection that we don t see or understand yet,1
absolutely fascinating thank you thank you,2
i have for many years studied this phenomenon and i am still awestruck,2
bells inequality settled the argument between einstein and bohr showing that entanglement was a real phenomenon,1
it tells us that we are looking at the universe through the wrong end of the telescope,0

i thought the content and editing of this docu was really very good let down however once again by an agonising and overly intrusive soundtrack of bings bongs muzak and mood noise that was so distracting it was actually fighting the content for my attention please please dispense with this nonsense or offer a noise pollution free variant it is such a problem in shows such as this horizon in the uk is especially bad,0
my mind just expanded with the universe straight up,2
as if the designers of the universe overlooked the possibility that a species would evolve enough to work out some of it no wonder it makes no sense at a quantum level when they realise what were up to well know they know imagine that was actually true d,0
subscribe and your life will be awesome forever offer only last minutes,2
i remember watching this channel,1
i remember watching physics and he is one of the nicest person i ever saw and one day i want to play with him on fortnite and i wish i meet himbin duo fill,2
i would love the vbucks and the reason i think i deserve it is ive been subed since k and i love your videos,2
man your like the best you make kids so happy when there sad,2
love your videos and i hope that kid has the best life,2
whats up been a long time subscriber love the content keep up the good content,2
i can tell by the multiple times he says he s getting high ground and how physics doesn t care the he s one of those obsessive jerks that keeps bullying even though no one really cares cleary the high ground doesn t matter because every time he absolutely bodied him,0
his videos are always funny and cool and kind,2
i deserve the vbucks because i ve watched your channel for a years and i would love to gift several of your subscribers skins,2
life man what is it even,0
meanwhile this evening i did a bad impression of prof cox on stage to a few hundred people and even though it was so dodgy everyone knew who it was as he s such a legend nice to hear him talk about sagan as many see him as a modern version,2
we are a way for the universe to know itself carl sagan of course the scientist with the heart of a poet excellent discussion with a favorite physicist professor brian cox i could listen to him all day thank you be smart and pbs for the thoughtprovoking video subscribed,2
you sir are a superlative teacher and so is professor cox this has been one of the most fascinating interviews and youtube presentations that i have seen but then i m an old man an old medical doctor of a man who has had the pleasure of experiencing many good and great teachers in his lifetime and learning new things for me remains one of my greatest pleasures and this border conjunction between the life sciences and the physical sciences is one of my greatest fascinations i am so very glad that i found your channel and subscribed to it,2
brian cox as always doesn t disappoint he s very deep and thoughtful in a very accessible way,2
i absolutely love professor brian cox after watching his tedtalk about a year ago i watched as many videos of him as i could and he has incredibly increased my interest in physics and astronomy thank you for the great video,2
this channel is a key example of why publicly funded media is still so important in the digital era the right people given the right resources can do amazing things and grow to provide so much more value to society than what was invested keep up the amazing work,2
very thought provoking video ive always found brian coxs viewpoints very interesting he sees the same things as other scientists but he helps us think about it just a little differently than many which can help us think differently ourselves fascinating,2
one of the most interesting informative and thoughtprovoking discussions i have ever seen thanks guys,2
something funny i just noticed aside from looking sort of alike both brian cox and shigeru miyamoto seem to almost be incapable of speaking without smiling being experts in completely different fields both just seem so curious and enjoying what they do what a joy to listen to these guys and just have them around,2

welp there are literally no excuses at this point you can literally teach yourself anything,2
its truly a great time to be alive to be able to have resources like this be so freely available for anyone to use,2
this is remarkably clearly communicated almost unique every single wording every sentence is chosen with a purpose the examples are very descriptive needless to say the topic is a bit complex it is adressed subject to an almost perfect understanding of exactly when the apprentice finds some topic extra difficult imagine having a teacher like this when being in formative years sometimes in life you happen to encounter people with an abovehuman talent to communicate complex matters in an accessible way simple enough but not to simple it is important to recognize this and to cherish those rare moments,2
what a great professor thanks for giving us the opportunity to learn from you,2
wow many a thanks never thought will be able to see course of such quality in youtube,2
this is the first lecture where i actually ended up feeling like i finally got general relativity thank you,2
thanks for the video ive always been interested in physics but chose to go into chemistry for undergrad its awesome to have great explanations and videos so easily accessible,2
dear professor thank you for your generosity i m actually listening to your lecture at work as music it brings me back to my university days lots of things you teach much better too,2
masterpiece thanks a lot sirits a complete video course in its own,2
when your physics teacher doesnt teach you physics so you rely on the internet,0
she makes times more sense than my professor who didnt explain anything and just started writing equations on the board,2
she has a lot of potential to become a rapper,2
i want a crash course physics history telling us about how all everything was discovered,1
these videos are saving physics students lives every single day,2
does the sound dim at random points for anyone else its like someone muffled the mic arbitrarily,0
this is a better explanation than ive heard in any college physicsengineering course thanks,2
electronic engineer here you just explained static electricity better than all my teachers in university the topic can be very confusing for beginners this course gets better every time,2
when you try the tape thing and feel like a scientist,1
this would be a great introduction for a crash course electronics series i really think you guys do a great job explaining complicated things simply,2
kudos to this man for going out of his way to present something that his students will remember for the rest of their lives,2
i had a physics teacher similar to this my junior year he always presented everything we were learning in a tangible way with real application looking back it was my favorite course,2
i remember watching this exactly years ago and being amazed by it i tried the experiment in an empty classroom years later physics still fascinates me,2
i can learn more from this dude than my actually physics teacher,2
i miss his lectures so much they were posted here on youtube for a while i m not sure if they are anymore but he is one of the reasons i love physics,2
even knowing the results my heart was still beating fast when he released the ball,2
we want more than this honorable teacher the theory and the practice in the mean time learning for the students will be a real pleasure thank you sir,2
i never took a interest in physics but this dude made me understand the basics of converting gravitational potential to kinetic enegry huge respect,2
i had and experienced this same experiment in a high school physics class in as we studied pendulum motion the teacher of that class was a phd physicist taking a two year sabbatical from a national lab his demonstration also included a lesson in the difference between what we say and what we believe each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose he asked each of us do you know the laws of pendulum motion our response was of course yes then just as he released the shotput he said know we will see if you believe them most but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses only a few ducked away a the last second that was years ago i remember it like it was yesterday sadly today that teacher would not be able to do that experiment or any of the other amazing things he did in that classroom the lessons are to structured preprogramed and rigid for creative teachers to inspire the young minds and imaginations of their students plus the specter of liability would be the death of any imaginative and creative teaching,1
for once a teacher got my undivided attention on a subject that bored me in high school and college i would have loved to have you as my science teacher you kept my interest thank you very much,2
what s one new thing you re learning this month any school and college students here where are you from,1
very cool my grandfather who died at right before the pandemic used to collect physics toys and loved to demonstrate and explain how they work because of him i have a good understanding of buoyancy surface tension states of matter electrical conductance and many other concepts we need people like you to teach this stuff to the next generation keep up the good work,2
those vortex marbles are pieces of art,2
i had multiple oil drop timers as a kid love those things,2
i had several oil drop timer as a kid and i didnt remember for years until this video very cool they were so fascinating and i could watch them for hours,2
the perpetual motion simulator is similar to the space wheel that used to sell for about ten dollars used ones on amazon are now going for ten times thatbut theyre still cool,2
this perpetual motion simulator looks quite cool i also remember having one of these oil drop timers many many years ago,2
another knowledge to shared thanks a lot,2
i learnt about this in my physics book on perpetual motion a long time back very fascinating to watch,2
the perpetual motion simulator is really something i could watch all day,2
did you ever expect this to ever happen also are you ready for that gold digger video,1
neon honestly looked like he was having fun with physics,2
honestly he is a good guy when he ain t in a mood,2
i dont think ronnie wants to buy the whole restaurant,0
can i just say that n on is a savage rn,0
imagine this guy with his personality if he is not rich,0
the only thing neon pulls is his mom s credit card,1
damn man im seeing physics face he changed damn i havent watch you in year,0
n on no way bro x me makes swish and breaks my brothers ankles n on cant even dribble,0
hes literally tripped out the whole video when you met him,0
i think its really a testament to your explanation skills that the schrodinger equation seems like its the obvious solution once youve seen it it was of course not obvious even to schrodinger himself the time and effort you must put into these videos is astounding and i thoroughly enjoy watching them great work,2
in all of my university courses textbooks websites and videos ive indulged to learn intro qm this is easily the best overview with the clearest and most wellput explanations and motivations thank you,2
i love how you start building up from the historical background something we don t see often i hope you will upload more often,2
it always amazed me that when i was in school everything about quantum mechanics was a synonym of something very difficult and counterintuitive thanks to the pop culture and popular science articlesvideos on youtube after studying in university it turned out to be much easier espesially considering that classcial mechanics is not that simple either if i saw this video years ago i would have understood that fact earlier thank you for this clear and neat explonation,2
outstanding work i somehow managed to understand all of it whilst understanding none of it at each stage coming from a nonphysics background and with only a limited understanding of calculus to be able to carry a viewer with my limited ability along is testament to your superb communication thank you,2
having taken a physics degree many decades ago may i congratulate you on such an excellent presentation,2
just the perfect amount of details the depth and breadth of these videos are fantastic thank you for putting all this effort into them,2
i hope you know this video came at the perfect time for me ive been teaching myself quantum chemistry from a physical chemistry textbook recently and i was using your channel to understand blackbody radiation haha glad to see a new video from you man you always put in an insane amount of time into these,2
i am doing my doctorate in engineering and studying theoretical physics is my all time favourite hobby i am going to derive all these myself now many thanks for creating this wonderful presentation,2
beautifully explained what a great refresher of qm with valuable illustrations,2
let me remind people who are scared splitting an atom makes it blow up smacking two particles together doesnt make explosions it makes fusions,0

i feel i have witnessed this before,1
ooops pushed again into another alternate dimension i wonder what this one will be like,0
i feel the reality changing in my vains,1
i am going to sit through this and pretend i understand every word of it,1
never thought i would understand dr penroses answer more than dr petersons questions,1
we need more people like penrose he is really thinking outside the box he doesnt put assumptions on all the things he learned like many smart people still do we need more people like him who is curious and ask the right questions he truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge he points them out clearly we are watching a genious of our time years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look,2
wow i am so glad i discovered dr penrose today i wanted to refrain from any comments but i have to say that the interviewer asked better questions than dr peterson and he seemed to understand what prof penrose was meaning whilst dr petersons brain seemed to shortcircuited a few times my view is that dr peterson came in with an upfront agenda not to learn but to convince kudos to prof penrose for schooling dr peterson okay i said enough,2
sir roger will probably be with us for another decade he seems incredibly lucid and physically well my grandfather is and still going strong and he looked very much like sir roger does here when he was,2
despite being a brilliant mathematician nobel laureate physicist worldly acclaimed academic i love how willing sir roger is to say i dont know,2
arent we all so fortunate to be able to listen in and watch a conversation like this,2
damn this man is sharp for his age my granddad bless his soul only got to live to the age of and in his last years he deteriorated to such a degree that he couldnt function at all it was sad to witness sir penrose is now almost and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults arent able to do amazing,0
it s crazy to see dr jordan peterson learning when i see him in videos i just assume he knows everything already like he just has a flash drive plugged in somewhere,1
dr peterson there is another physicist turned philosopher who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness basing himself in his understanding of physics his name was david bohm he is now deceased but he wrote a book called wholeness and the implicate order in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation and which i found very enlightening i recommend it to you and while youre at it you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics called bohmian mechanics since you showed interest in quantum theory his interpretation gets rid of the inconsistencyincompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way and in a way which takes all of the apparent magic out of the theory i was fascinated to see that roger penrose uses godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness since i came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics so cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man,2
do you like the new face cam and intro style,1
this goated aim right here,1
the fact that n on calls everyone poor but he always wears the default in fortnite,0
i like how physics says coach he kinda sounds like a cowboy from the westits funny just how he says it,2
if anyone wanted to see something cursed here it is faze n on,0
bruh neon freaks out when gets a good gun imagine how he acts when he gets vbucks,0
the way how the rich kid kept closing his eyes and making extpresions will making threats just made me cringe,0

im a simple man i see a dude with pens in his pocket i like and subscribe,2
pens in the shirt pocket is the science equivalent of military ribbons,1
how many pens do you need frank yes,1
frank is a fantastic physicist one of my favourites all those pens are so he doesnt run out of ink while in deep deep thought working out those equations love it,2
this guy loves science so much he gets so excited talking about it he sometimes forgets to breathe friggin awesomeness,2
this was the first thing on my algorithm and i knew i didn t even have to scroll anymore we love you lex these podcasts are amazing,2
if you read his book a beautiful question finding natures deep design you cant help but love the man hes a genius,2
just as i m getting frustrated with my chemistry and math this semester this podcast pops up perfect timing lex it s time to get my fight back,0
as a side note let me say a word about asymptotic freedom this is why we love lex fridman,2
honestly for what its worth the physics of everything seems to be pretty well optimized if you have a graphics card that is at least better than a xfx,2

try using the replay mod then it will render the physics with hopefully a higher framerate,2
i love your content and how much effort you put into it,2
i haven t watched you for a while just to see how far you would go and you went better than i expected,2

you deserve a peace prize for single handedly teaching every student on zoom university,2
i never thought i could learn or understood physics problems but i must confess that youve changed that now i am working physics problems and i have also been able to applied your method to other problems and i am doing it we need people who can break complex information down and also explain things like you do thank you so much for doing what you right and god bless,2
i feel like everythings gonna be ok when i watch your videos thanks,2
you are a life saver i got stuck with a pretty bad teacher and literally wouldve failed my exam if it wasnt for you,0
ive been spending two weeks listening to my professor but i havent learned a thing until i watched your hour video you have no idea how grateful i am to you,2
you do the best explanations without skipping the steps thank you so much for your time and work,2
guys please watch the ads fully this man deserves the ad revenue for how much he helps us all out,2
have a physics exam tomorrow and this clears up the material so well i cannot begin to explain how much this channel has helped me with precalc calc i and physics while studying to get an accounting degree,2
you have helped me with most of high school calc physics and chem thank you so much and another thing thats nice about these videos is that people will always need them this was posted years ago but there are still people who need this kind of help so thank you,2
i think perpetual motion will be eventually possible not by violating laws of physics but by tapping the fundamental forces of the universe instead of chemical fuels and such the only trick is deciding what k nd of entropy to exhaust into,1
all of these are awesome i think i want to master the discipline of physics it is one of the greatest phenomena in nature,2
great video thank you on my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against earths gravity they can fly with no moving mechanical parts they create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards they dont defy physics though rather they rely on wellknown physics it used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground there are more than public videos of the craft,2
amazing video thank you yes atomic motion is perpetual mass changing its position in space motion perpetual well for most of us billions of years is long enough so examples of perpetual motions does not factor in wear and tear of the device solar panels water mills wind mills geo thermal iceland john bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts i personally recharged hundreds of batteries with carefully measured results the physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view one device and what it does by itself yes thats being confined to thermodynamics however look outside the box for energy source solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels but from the sun thermodynamics is true in closed or isolated systems nitinol is also overunity which perpetual motion is a part of using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically the most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma an electrically charged ionized gas well a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas and they will be energized until the end of time by stars are we introverted into a small device set in motion or are we scientifically logically looking at the big picture as long as we stay stuck in a boxedin frame of reference we dont progress every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically from all points of view cheers,2
physics does explain everything you have to know the behavior of subatomic particles to get that,1
starlite is pretty incredible stuffit can even be used as heat sheild coating on spacecraft like the tiles on the americans space shuttle,2
just like some self winding wrist watches continue to tick these mechanisms could be incorporated into these gorbachev,1
this video is amazing i was like wow wow wow thank you for posting,2
these clips are realy interesting thanks letting us know about these new things,2

anyone else trying to cram weeks of content the night before the exam,1
hey i just wanted to let you know that i am taking physics rn at university and you teach me much more than my professors actually do the way you break things down is so helpful and easy to follow,2
i thank you teaching me more in mins that my teacher can in days,2
he did it again the man who saves academic careers thanks man really,2
you are amazing thank you so so so much these videos are extremely helpful you know exactly how to break everything down and make it simple then build on it thank you thank you thank you,2
you are the best professor i have this semester,2
i have a physics exam in days and i just started i actually don t know how to do anything wish me luck guys and good luck to everyone else that s in the same situation,1
your videos will teach learners the day before their test for years to come thank you,2
love susskind and his no nonsense outlook on the world,2
quantum entaglement is a phenomenon that must be researched much more it is simply amazing,2
the trouble with the holographic notion is pov point of view on the one hand and photon density on the other then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that can t be projected and of course light speed having said that i do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon that being the interaction of matter energy with the higgs field at the plank scale to my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space so that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram,1
on the stanford channel i obsessively watched all of susskinds lectures,2
so correct a civilization cant only rely on an abstract science but on technology as well,1
what would it look like if we met the extent of the knowledge god allowed us to know it would be like we were contained inside of a realm like a bubble and so one part of the bubble is connected to the next part of the bubble and it is all connected but we can never know what is outside of the bubble to know how the bubble truly works because we can never be outside the bubble when pressed against the bubble we can see a bit ways outside of it to see that we are inside a bubble like finding balance between the left and right side of a bicycle god set limits of the ocean and of the mountains and of the thickness of our skin and since he will always know more than us he has set limits on what we are allowed to know but it is a good thing to flesh out all the areas we are allowed to know to make use of them,1
the audio is pulled from a talk given by susskind at uc berkeley search for it on youtube and you ll find it not sure why this channel doesn t cite that talk in the description they re just repackaging sound bites with impressive graphics,0
you know when someone is worth little if people talk about what he researches not what he accomplished or what his research accomplished everyone is constantly researching life just by living it but we dont give a shit unless you manage something useful and so is with this guy just very unremarkable,0
i love how all the old theories that haven t quite been proved to a few have been jumbled together into new science we are as a species so intelligent through trial error and years and years of mechanics and maths has brought us so close to answering so many deep questions about the universe when we as a species unlock all its secrets we will be the most dominant force in the universe,2
do you quantum physics take general relativity to be your lawful wedded physics theory yes no,1
newton should have asked himself how an apple even got up there,1
this video was so good i didn t even realize it was years old,2
i think weve just found the most intense hype man for trees,2
the goal of evaporation is to cool down the leaf the reason leafs are green is to avoid absorbing too much radiation the sun produces a lot of energy and similar to humans a tree needs to protect himself from sunlight think about how hot it gets at solar noon and the fact that the tree needs to sit in direct sunlight for the entire day the tree is literally cooling itself down through evaporative cooling similar to how humans do it through sweating this process is known as evapotranspiration,1
hank saying right was just praying to the gods of physics that there wasnt a pure vacuum in tree leaves,1
why should there be a height limit minecrafters liked that,1
its really amazing to think that this video is almost years old i didnt even notice until after watching it compared to most other youtubers in this is god tier quality,2
the second amazing thing is how do the roots pump moisture out of what can be half dry soil what human pump could duplicate that,2
i m a refrigeration technician and i realized a while back that the water evaporates out of the bottoms of the leaves to refrigerate them when water evaporates the vapor pulls heat from the remaining source water cooling it this is necessary because sunlight has the potential to heat the leaves beyond the temperature they can still function for photosynthesis,1
so in short trees do not bend the laws of physics trees use the laws of physics cleverly,1
should i ask out my crush also make sure to like this video and subscribe to enter the giveaway,1
youre a perfect person man just keep going,2
can we watch one video where he plays throughout the hole match without leaving,1
i like how he asked who she was then start saying he has seen her tik tok an insta,2
audi says she will s really beautiful but he hasn t even seen her,1
and i love how you help kids in need and it makes me feel good about myself one of your vids nearly made me cry,2
you re such a good person and you ve done so much for these people,2
because i could do loads for my fam because they are pore,1
physics she s my crush me chillen at home what the heck how says that to his crush bro,1
one reason i like you so much is that your so positive and you should,2
math isnt my favorite subject but this looks so interesting i think that i can get good at this kind of math if i study and practice alot i really want to learn this stuff,2
for all highschoolers and university students having midlife crisis computer science is fun since you get to build stuff that doesnt yet exist or build something that you use and make it a lot better computer science is the study of computers involving complex algorithms and youll be looking for stuff on the internet and stackoverflow alot you dont have to memorize everything like a computer but you have to know how to make a computer memorize and process the information and perform the activities that you want it to cs undergrad,2
the way you described discrete maths made me realize i dont even hate math i just have to study to get better,2
your videos are so solid and legitimately helpful you have an understanding of the topics and give in depth contentexamples thanks my man nuggets of youtube,2
title of this video should be what is discrete mathematics,1
wow i swear this is one of the best youtube channels ive ever come across youre exceptionally knowledgeable about all these fields thank you so much,2
good video im in the least popular branch in cs cs theory research im glad you mentioned induction if one dives into program verification youll see that induction is essential to doing any kind of proof because induction corresponds to recursion in programming induction on the natural numbers may not be interesting but think about induction on your data types and proving properties about them in fact induction does not only apply to natural numbers but any inductively defined set,2
damn this got me more excited for computer science the discrete maths seems very interesting and eager to learn about it,2
great video i m back in school taking classes for my masters of computer science my bachelors was in economics im trying to decide on if i should do a concentration in big data management or cybersecurity what do you think is the better choice income and job market differences between these two,2
thank you very much ive just finished my first semester at cs and indeed we did all of those this is great for showing what will be in the first semester,2
as someone who just graduated with a cs degree i can confidently say that you successfully condensed years of my life into minutes well done,2
its mindblowing how youre able to explain so much in a single video while being completely accurate easy to understand and also funny i think youre one of the best content creators on youtube and this might be one of the best tech videos ive ever seen go fireship,2
thanks legendary content really appreciate the work you put into it,2
im wrapping up my second semester as a cse major and i was pleasantly surprised to see that ive already learned a huge chunk of these concepts i really love this field so far and i cant wait to learn more,2
no one can deny that the most important cs concept in this video is st computer science concept you just simply cannot let grandma down,2
that was astonishingly well written edited and generally put together thank you for the work you put in jeff that was a trip,2
my entire cs degree just flashed in those minutes amazing work,2
im about years into teaching myself programming alongside my full time job and this is one of the best videos ive ever seen its the background language and contexts we dont get from tutorials or experimentation thank you so much,2
im a young student interested in computers and i really enjoy your videos every time thank you for making these awesome videos,2
its fun how learning is more of a speedrun these days which acts as a very good starter motivating us to learn the remaining stuff by ourselves and now we have something of a map which we can follow instead of blindly jumping into stuff,2
absolute pleasure working on this thanks again for the opportunity,2
introduction what is programming how do we write code how do we get information from computers what can computers do what are variables how do we manipulate variables what are conditional statements what are array s what are loops what are errors how do we debug code what are functions how can we import functions how do we make our own functions what are arraylists and dictionaries how can we use data structures what is recursion what is pseudocode choosing the right language applications of programming,1
i just started a coding class and the teacher is assuming all of the class already has basic notions of programming a few of us dont including myself this is exactly what i needed thank you so much,2
finally i did it it took me around hours to complete it including making notes and it has been very useful and i am fully satisfied thanks steven and shawn,2
i wish i had this resource years ago when i was struggling through my st semester of computer science learning java i was so lost i totally lost interest in attempting coding but this makes me want to give learning programming another go,1
ive been wanting to learn programming for awhile but had absolutely no idea of what it all entails this video really helped to give me that thanks so much im so excited to start my journey into computer software,2
im in th grade and just wanted to learn how to code this video is a great introduction to coding for me keep up the good work,2
studying a computer science degree atm and skimmed through this video can confirm this is really good and the fact this is free you guys are absolute legends good on ya,2
thank you for this amazing content many online courses and bootcamps fail to go over the foundations and this is exactly what we needed,2
im finishing my bachelors in cs next month and im watching this because you never want to forget the fundamentals you always come back to this stuff,2
hey thanks for all the comments yes i agree that i should have added in computer security alongside hacking it is a huge and important field so i regret leaving it off and i should also have mentioned interpreters along with compilers as this is an important concept especially having coded a fair amount of python i have no excuses i added a couple of notes in the video description thanks for pointing these omissions out and thanks for all the words of encouragement as well i was trying something new with the graphic design on this one trying to match the look to the subject matter and i think it worked out well,2
absolutely wonderful,2
this color scheme is the most beautiful ever dark blue neon blue neon pink dark purple just beautiful,2
i am a final year computer science engineering student and i would like to say you literally videoed my entire year course work briefly in minutes great work,2
i started my computer engineering course this year at age sometimes i feel so bad in the classes cause im too old and everyone else there is almost teenagers also at this age everyone expect me to have childrens and a job not to be in college but now watching this video this made me so pround and happy all of this is too beatifull and ill do whatever it takes science is my passion since i was a kid and this is all that really matter,2
as a cs student this poured a bucket of passion into me update i will be a data science intern at nasa goddard space flight center summer,2
computer science has to be treated like all the other science based subjects such as physics chemistry or biology its a shame most schools dont take cs as a serious subject,0
the turing machine reminds me of protein synthesis,1
that moment when you feel like a badass because you knew a little something about every topic he mentioned d great video and great map thank you,2
i remember watching this videos in i was at the time now im and studying computer science a mad special thank you dude it is really an interesting field to study in you made me find my passion thank you again hamad,2
maybe it was a bad idea to talk about code for hours try and condense it into an minute youtube video disclaimer this is not a beginners tutorial and new programmers should not be intimidated i am simply trying to show how multiple layers of technology integrate with eachother each minute of this video can be broken down into months of learning its taken me over years of university plus highschool plus personal projects,1
just finished my second year in cs and i finally understand everything not just the information but his suffering,1
watch in x speed to learn everything in minutes,1
i watched this video around two years ago when i was a senior in high school with pretty much zero programming experience im in college right now earning a degree in computer engineering and its crazy how ive gone from understanding nothing in this video to understand most of it,1
now i understood what my pet feels like when i tell something to him,1
the first time i watched this video i wasnt able to comprehend almost anything was in my st semester in cs today im currently in my nd semester of my nd year theres a light in a tunnel what was once pitch black now is starting to have meaning cs has both joy and suffering a complete balance,2
now i know that programming cant be learn in minutes,0
im currently in my second year and im taking both c and java great video btw,2
in your video description you might regard c as the fastest language but this isnt always the case both c and rust can achieve the same performance even with higherlevel language features zerocost abstractions compiler optimization is a large part of language performance,2
just finished second year cs and glad to find that our curriculum is exactly what he talked about and with such a strong foundation in third year we learn about operating systems more dsa and anything else are at our choosing ml ai computer graphics general swe etc,2
september th spam the comments with shavejasonshead,1
it really depends on whether you are studying at a college or a university how theoretical it gets i just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university and basically programming is not being taught to you just very very minimally you are expected to do learn it yourself on your own and everyone does so anyways it is more a tool that you use for other courses than what you are learning towards i had a lot of theoretical courses in maths theoretical computer science complexity theory technical computer science transistors and stuff and practical computer science algorithms and datastructures you can use your programming skills everywhere to solve tasks and that is the beauty of it,1
i like this guys videos i probably watched his journey to becoming a microsoft engineer times,2
interviewer how long was your cs program me minutes,1
this helped me feel more confident that im indeed learning stuff even though i still have a long road ahead it was good to realize half of the concepts already feel familiar if i may suggest a video idea you could do something similar to this but about frameworks libs deployers package managers compilers git docker and all that other tools and weirdly namedstuff that comes with learning a language because as a beginner all those names are really overwhelming thanks for another great content youre really good explaining stuff,2
that is a special kind of tree binary search tree since stack is a last in first out data structure pushpop is usually shown the other way round,1
another advantage of twos complement is that addition subtraction and multiplication on it are simpler you just do the same as with unsigned values one way to explain that is using modular arithmetic unless you use long arithmetic numbers are computed modulo to the power of the number of bits in an integer and the numbers that the same bit string represents in unsigned types and in twos complement are equivalent,2
what a well laid out video im starting a masters programme in cs at the end of the month after graduating as a bsc in physics and this video really helped in assuring myself that im not in over my head and am actually surprisingly familiar with the topics to come of course i dont mean to underestimate the amount of work to come but at least im more confident now,2
not really c is much more complex than c you have the standard template librarystl templates check stdenableif for example different methods of casting cstyle cast staticcast dynamiccast reinterpretcast rtti run time type information concepts and constraints some kind of traits concept and require keywords rangebased for loops rvalues and lvalues lambda expressions stdlaunder i dont know what memory laundering is and more using c with standard c functions is a antipattern same for using c as c with classes as it was initially created,1
i just started learning python recently and this video was incredibly helpful it actually blew my mind how expertly you described these concepts,2
all i needed was the child level and was like okay got it thank you,2
timestamps because i know you got sheit to do child teen college student grad student expert upvote for others to see,1
wow i love how he explains things and especially his auracalming and not judgmental imho pure of the intention to i want to help you to understand this honestly it has been a very long time i havent feel this feeling very soothing,2
as a final year computer science student i still barely understand np complete but this explanation is super useful it s like abstraction,2
i love the expression of pride and admiration and excitement on the interviewers face when talking with the grad student hes soooo happy that someone upandcoming really gets it i dont get it completely but im glad there are people out there who love to learn and love when others learn too fantastic,2
my dad explained me this a long time ago he would tell me how hard his path to school was without revealing anything,1
the analogy of the safe basically explains rsa encryption its very easy to stick paper into the slit encrypt your message using the public key but without knowing the combination of the safe the two prime numbers the key is composed of its impossible to get your message back if someone can correctly decrypt a message you encrypted with a public key they proved to know the two prime numbers,1
i wish all my teachers taught me things like how this guy taught the child simple and effective,2
it amazes me how passionate the conversation got when the grad student got onive not heard a real and genuine math conversation in a whileappreciate yall,2
level child level teen level college student level grad student level expert,1
and so it begins procrastinating on my actual studies to learn something different from crash course,0
the industrial revolution computings origins the abacus astrolabe and the slide rule optimizing leibniz step reckoner range tables speed and accuracy charles babbages difference engine approximates polynomials the analytical engine ada lovelace the worlds st programmer the us census holleriths punch machine ibm international business machines corporation next week digital computers,1
love the material love the host its clear to me that you really love this topic and youre articulate and passionate im so excited for this series thank you,2
i would really love it if crash course would make a course about teaching us how to program where in each episode they teach us about the basics of one language,2
i feel like ive just taken an awesome short course thats quite easy to follow and packed with interesting knowledge and totally free awesome cant wait to see the next one,2
ahhh i am super excited to follow this series i have had my mind set on becoming a video game designer for a while and this series gives me the opportunity to learn the basics of computer science thank you d,2
computers can seem pretty complicated but really theyre just simple machines that perform complex actions through many layers of abstraction yeah okay,1
im so happy you guys are doing this im a software developer and i absolutely love the videos you guys do im really looking forward to the rest of this series,2
oooo im so excited for this carrie anne is a fantastic presenter this first episode was pretty dense already but it didnt feel like it great job to the whole team,2
this is amazingly educational most of these are not mentioned in school,2

i was on a class zoom forgetting i wasn t on mute and the entire class heard hello mortals coming from my laptop,1
my code works i have no idea why my code doesnt work i have no idea why,0
had a rough day and hearing hello mortals made me geniuely happy thanks you majestic science robot,2
me an it student watching this ah yes arrays,1
this is like a dictionary defining a dictionary,1
a computer ai teaching computer science is like a doctor talking about anatomy,1
as a professional software engineer lemme tell you that the whole bit about having to be good at finding the answer on google is true,2
if the person behind the character isn t a professor or scientist themselves i d be deeply surprised,1
lets learn about compilers talks about python an interpreted language,1
agreed with patrick cs is more about theoretical knowledge whereas most of the people are going to deal with application level programming which requires more application level knowledge i think software engineering course suits the needs of most of the people in this regard,2
computer science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them and while you can learn programmingdevelopment by watching a bunch of youtube videos if you lack the basic cs knowledge you will always struggle to make technical choices come up with a poorsuboptimal design while this is understandable that for some people the cs curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well it is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals youre gonna have a hard time overcoming those,2
the degree is basically a foundation for anything that is to come after,1
its odd that everyone knows college is nearly useless yet every business requires you to have it just to be considered for an interview,0
thanks patrick i raised great kids my youngest is majoring in cs where i m not qualified to mentor him been letting you handle that for me since now my whole family loves your videos many thanks for sharing your wisdom on tech and general life advice wishing you all the best,2
when i started in computer science i was surprised how many of my classmates didnt even like to code they saw programming as at best a steeping stone to their real career my cs coursework certainly never taught me much programming my best teacher was my library of plum hall books in my case a professor liked my code and recommended me as a research assistant which was my first computer job the position was supposed to go to a cs grad student and i was an undergrad music major my research areas were mainly data compression and pattern recognition i was within a stones throw of finishing my music degree when i realized that i met the requirements for a cs degree so i ended up graduating with a cs major music minor even though i had times as many hours in music as cs in my case i didnt program for long even though i enjoyed coding my bigger interest was systems and that is the direction i went after graduating,1
techlead this is a fantastic video very well done in my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science i found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively in math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis in physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card we programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data i think you are correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline,2
i was really under a lot of stress and pressure to pursue a masters degree and i was thinking of doing a computer science degree since i had a bachelors in it too but just like you said apart from or courses here the other courses are havoc the photographer example was spot on this video really helped me change my perspective thanks a lot i really feel like this video was tailor made for me thanks again subscribed ofc,2
for me what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern they hired me because i worked for them on my senior capstone project fall semester so i worked for them as an intern during my last semester through that following summer and then i landed my first full time job in the fall i would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee,2
i agree with everything youre saying but how come you dont highlight the greatest gift of a computer science degree problem solving i struggled through school but now looking back im actually very glad i took these courses for one it taught me the limits of my knowledge and how much there is to learn taking these classes dont make you an expert in the field instead it teaches introduces you to the fundamentals in the broad field of computer science armed with this fundamental knowledge you can have a much clearer perspective of how the pieces come together and allows you to problem solve better sure it doesnt teach you the practical skills but problemsolving is an essential skill for any career especially in tech when you strip away all the fancy frameworks and the technologies that come and go at the core what you have is computer science which you can use to build these solutions,2
level explain machine learning to the machine,1
i had so much fun filming this video i love the final product thank you wired,2
the little girl blew her cover so early in her career,0
i like listening to smart people talking about stuff they know alot about,2

im acualy suprised how good an precise she explaind machine learning to the child respect,2
this is not just a computer scientist she is an amazing communicator she mirrors the talking points of the learner and always positively commends their opinions all while constantly smiling and making the learner feel at ease what an amazing person,2
hilary is exceptional at explaining and engaging with people at all different levels of expertise,2
hilary mason is not only a computer scientist but one of the first famous data scientists a very wellknown word today but not so much a decade ago her research and knowledge sharing has helped to develop the field into becoming the vast and useful network it is today great video,2
hope this vid was helpful more lifestyle vlogs coming very soon midterms and assignments are only going to pile up from here make sure you have tools like grammarly to help you succeed remember to sign up for a free account and get off grammarly premium,2
finally the first guy on yt thats not a straight a overachiever student at an elite t school i quit school after struggling and finding out i had adhd ive been wanting to learn programmingcs topics this video helped put things into perspective that i can still make it even if im not a top student at a top school thanks for the video,2
this was the most relatable my cs degree in x minutes i ve seen thank you,2
thanks jed you made me realize that it s not always about the grades there s so much more to life,2
i love how relatable your comment was that your grades were average for cs one of the reasons why i didn t go the cs route was because i didn t think i had good enough grades to get through it when i think back at it i should have done it anyways,2
very transparent youtuber always great content i m an accountant major and i love your videos,2
i don t know anything about software engineering but i still watched the whole video i m always down to any content,2
i just started and i am a freshman it makes me feel a lot better to know that someone else didnt have their resume ready i started html css and js on my own and am doing to websiteresume thing now so i can practice web development all through out college along with other stuff that i learn so i can put all of my projects on there kind of like a show case,2
dear jed im a comsci student but i dont really watch you because youre into computer science but i watch you just because i really enjoy your daily vlogs and videos obviously its a plus when computer science is involved just like when you made that messaging app that looks like discord my point is that dont be too conscious of your viewers and just make videos and follow your heart,2
love your content jedcal keep it up i appreciate your honesty in showing the grades you received including explaining the courses that stood out to you during your attendance at bu edit it for sure makes me more comfortable with my academic performance how im not the only average guy out there,2
for anyone in a hurry software developer systems analyst network systems admin dba web developer security analyst ai cryptography cyber security bio informatics cg,1
i know im two years late to see this but i hope you read it thanks for making this im probably going into computer science and i had no idea what my options were this helps out things into perspective and honestly makes me more confident about pursuing this degree because it seems like i have pretty good options,2
man your channel is fire finally someone who knows what people is looking for,2
these videos are awesome man if i may ask what dodid you study i myself am studying computer science right now and i can say that these videos are really helpful for someone who is in doubt about what they want to do keep up the good work d,2
im thinking about getting into a computer career this is my first time hearing like different titles about working on computers thank you so much for sharing this video i just need to find the right title that will fit me with dealing with computers because i like working all computers,2
awesome im transferring from a community college with an associates in science into the cit program at my local university ive never been that great at math and after watching your video i think system administration or networking would probably be the best for me,2
i loved this videovery well done and refreshing compared to the other career overview videos ive seen for computer science i have a degree in biology and have already written down those genetics companies you mentioned so that i can see their job posts and if i have a potential future in bioinformatics by the time i get some cs classes under my belt honestly the cs industry as a whole seems like a playground so many interesting things security cryptography imagevideo rendering mobile app development new algorithms thank you again,2
your channel is fing awesome bro ive been thinking about studying science or computer science so thats exactly what i needed keep it up d,2
i love your videos man mechanical engineering sounded really apealing to me at first but after seeing the mech eng elec eng and cs videos im thinking electrical engineering with a focus on electronics or computers sounds more like me may also minor in cs but idk yet thanks for making these,2
let me note that computer graphics programming doesnt only involve images theres been some work on writing gpgpu software ie cudaopencl that accelerates system processes that are traditionally given to cpus in particular anything that can benefit from parallel computing will need gpu software,1
a message from future forrest check out my new tetris ai videos original post i may be biased but id say ignore these timestamps and just watch the video all the way through but i leave these here for anyone stopping by the video new channel or sec vlog official intro treating college like high school thinking cs was software development one thing i dont regret neglecting office hours procrastinating another thing i dont regret get internships early do you have any regrets should i make a new channel or what answer in the poll and leave your thoughts below,1
a computer science story first semester students second semester students outwit outplay outlast how many will remain find out on the next episode of survivor,1
i totally agree on internships i am a graduating senior in computer engineering and i have done internships internships really showed me what working was really like and helped me find where i want to work despite being in the depressed covid economy i already have a job offer lined up for when i graduate in december,2
when he said googling things every other minute i felt that,1
him i just had about to hours of homework after school me cries in asian,1
also don t forget to code outside of class and work on projects that interest you,2
i think that s what i m most afraid of getting internships early i m currently a freshman in college majoring in cs and i have little to no knowledge about coding so when i try to apply for internships i m afraid that these jobs that an intern does will involve hacking amazon s database or something wild,0
dude looks like he works at a surf board shop in florida chills with his friends at the beach on the weekends while listening to glam metal and knows how to enjoy life better than anyone in this comment section,2
right when i got into my first cs class in college i was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a line program in c for two days and never did any other programming that first cs class made me hate cs because the material was way too quick i started reading the first chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph and then it got too overwhelming since i was spending nearly hours for each chapter just taking notes each week i didn t have enough time so i stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because i was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses i understood how they worked but not at all their applications my advice read the textbook briefly and don t read every word so that you won t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together,0
one of the biggest things people should take into consideration if they re gonna pursue any it jobs or anything related to cs is that it never ends you ll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest comptia cert or if your current if good enough it s a rough life especially if you re married or in a relationship it s just constantly hours in front of the screen,0
the videos on this channel are so great its really a pity that you dont seem to be creating content anymore,2
nice work the animations did a great job of illustrating your points and it was well presented and explained i really enjoyed it,2
a modern computer science degree is basically a degree in discrete math but when computer science was founded it was much more closely related to being a science than it might be considered today however even if it has become more about proofs math and logic there still are investigations that require observing and testing factual information to determine breakthroughs as an example consider quantum computing and its development,1
this is an awesome video i havent found anything else that gives such a good intro to the pnp problem,2
mario is pspacecomplete and factoring is in np cap bqp its a bit misleading to say that all that stands between crackers and your data is a mario level because breaking encryption is much easier than beating mario,1
i dont know a lot about computer science but your visuals and the way you formulate the argument are very good,2
most technically its the study of algorithms which are a very specific way of solving problems but its hard to define exactly what an algorithm is without getting a good ways into computer science,1
i dont have a computer but it seems very helpful so i hope soon to get one i like how it teaches you about it so fascinating,2
pretty good summary i disagree with the statement that it isnt a science however cs researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments in fact thats how im spending my winter holiday like if i solve this problem with method x instead of method y i get a more reliable answer of course if you only have empirical evidence ie its been tested in the real world your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof so in that way it might be that some problems cs folks tackle are scientific empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics but some big popular branches of cs like machine learning and ai advance primarily through empirical rather than mathematic evidence whether mathematics itself is a science i will leave to the writers of dictionaries,1
as a sidenote we dont know if prime factorization is npcomplete and we dont know if its p either we only know its np id be surprised if someone discovered it to be in p and also if someone found it to be npcomplete because this would mean quantum computers would solve npcomplete problems in polynomial time if someone proofs that prime factorization is not p and not npcomplete wed finally know once and for all that p np via ladners theorem,1
he is only the person in the tedx talks who stood in a same place in the whole video,1
the people who say computer science isnt for everyone is missing the point it is not about whether you like the subject or not in his whole talk he is saying computer science is as necessary as mathbiologyphysics etc we do not learn these subjects because it is fun in school we learn them because it helps us to operate and appreciate the world better just like how math helps us to understand the purchases we make the loans we take and the value of the item we pay for a basic understanding of computer science helps us understand how the internet works how gadgets communicate how these technologies can impact our lives do not wait for the next cambridge analytica saga and pretend to be interested in technology,1
learning how to code helps your everyday logic tremendously youll learn how to think more efficiently,2
if you want to motivate people for your subject your goal should not be to show them how simple it is but instead how deep it is,2
ill definitely teach my kids about computer science thanks for the priceless knowledge,2
what a brilliant speaker i appreciate that he stood and didnt move the effect was i listened instead of being distracted by him moving and gesturing as a result of his presentation i intend to take his advice to learn more about computer science thank you hadi partovi for being a person who has changed the world with your passion and knowledge,2
im also a computer science graduate from iran and im completely agree with the transformation of this field which is happening to the world,2
what i love about computer programming in particular is that unlike any other subject taught in schools this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once what every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions so i believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds of course its not for everyone i know people who wont understand it no matter how they explain it to them but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either,2
last year i helped th and th grade students participate in hour of code this year our second graders got involved as did a class of special needs middle school students our students are begging to do more and i am going to give them as many opportunities as i can,2
i agree another thing that would be nice is more integration of computers into the rest of the classes for example math classes could teach excel graphs and formulas,2
free step guide to choose your dream career,1
as a computer science major who will soon be working in nyc as a software engineer i agree with many of the points in this video my firstyear salary will exceed k after only a bachelors degree although this is due to a combination of several internships done during college the cost of living in new york and sheer luck and blessings many of my peers are also finding roles with great compensation if any high schoolers college students or even people out of school are considering learning how to code i strongly urge you all to make the leap,2
one of my classmates from college was a former software developer he managed to break into the field without a cs degree but the company he worked for had to downsize they decided to lay off all employees who didnt have a year degree its an anecdotal example but having a degree in cs or a related field is a good investment for increased job security within such a volatile field of work,2
doing my cs degree right now not gonna lie it sure aint easy but its definitely something i love doing,2
short answer yes graduated with one in december now i make k at my job as a full stack engineer the best strategy is the degree and an internship or paid work to get a job it was well worth it,2
thanks man this reassured me that even if my entrepreneurial ventures go to shit my cs degree is a good safety net,2
im a computer science major and a few months away for graduation your videos have helped me out great job keep it up,2
we need these types of videos in veterinary and nursing degrees there are so many misconceptions about the two fields your help and expertise would be great,2
heres another con cs is not an easy degree to get im currently a graduate student in computer science and i also teach freshman computer science courses im a teaching assistant so i teach labs professors give lectures and from what ive seen at least of the freshmen entering computer science will be weeded out by the end of the year or as tren black would say business by christmas also very important contrary to what a lot of people think cs is not software engineering youre not just going to be writing code all the time youre going to have to study algorithms data structures formal methods discrete math computer architecture etc if you dont like math and youre not good at math you better buckle up and start reviewing or you too will be business by christmas,1
its been years since graduating with my computer engineering degree pay is amazing benefits are amazing flexibility is amazing the projects are usually interesting there are so many openings in computing there are so many business opportunities as well its absolutely insane i think companies are really really desperate for talent right now i got lucky ending up in silicon valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world at my university computer engineering was computer science electricalelectronics engineering its functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned i chose to take robotics electives in school but dont actually use those skills in my job im just a standard software developerengineer haha i have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field being the first target during layoffs and having to learn a ton of stuff that boot camps just dont cover with some tutoring and some years of onthejob training he is doing ok now too id definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning artificial intelligence programming languages computer graphics game development distributed systems and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry youre interested in,2

man loving these breakthrough videos its feels fulfilling to see the progress being made i mean finally modelling quantum gravity jeez,2
glad to have been a contributing member to this field had my first peer reviewed paper published in ieee this year,2
slight correction the infinite limit of shallow neural networks as kernel machines specifically gaussian processes was established in radford neal this was updated for relu nonlinearities in cho saul in lee bahri showed this result could be extended to deep neural networks not sure this counts as s biggest breakthrough though it is a cool result so happy to have it publicised,2
i appreaciate the efforts in trying to make these heavily technical subjects understandable to the general public thank you all,2
its crazy that weve been able to do so much with deep neural networks and we are only now starting to figure out how they work,2
mathematics is like that wind your sail boat needs to move way ahead on your journey this was so heart warming to watch there is really a thin line between maths and magic thanks a lot quanta magazine for this beautiful summary loved it,2
i have been using these kernel vector spaces for qml recently and this is one of those mathemagics i honestly adore,2
its crazy how much stuff from uni started flowing back watching this the fact that i can actually be able to understand all these complicated maths is crazy but exciting,2
these videos are severely underrated thank you for the knowledge you share and hopefully millions of people will be watching these per week its so good for people to know about these things,2
shane your video got me to major in computer science last year now i have a great internship thank you,2
months ago i started a soc security operations center internship which turned into a fulltime job even before getting my cs degree in august in a week i start as an information security engineer making kyr in the mountain west region they needed somebody who had a computer science background and experience in cybersecurity so many good career paths from a bachelors in cs but the key in my experience to making the most of your degree is developing your soft skills and being hungry to learn more,2
shane thank you for what you do it is very helpful could you do a video on benefits on minoring in computer science,2
your videos are complete thank you for helping us young entrepreneurs who aspire to get out of this norma cycle and create our own skills habits and connections,2
video recommendationvideos of each engineering major separately all the fields jobs career paths and industries you can enter with each one of these engineering majors or engineering degrees,1
also can you look into imaging laboratory bio and geo informatics in addition computational engineer and scientist,1
hello shane why dont u make a video about careers with good worklife balance thatd be wonderful,2
can you please do the same for computer engineering degree,1
you are one of the best youtubers ever man thank you so much for your information,2
correction at the graph says quinary system but then the graph shows possible states which is actually decimal technically there should be only possible values there but the overall concept is still the same note since we cant use annotations in our videos going forward if we find any smallish errors in our videos like this well leave clarifications in the episode description thanks all for the wonderful feedback brandon,2
i am a third year majoring in computer engineering and this video explains transistors and logic gates better than a semester class,2
it must be basic as hell for comp scientists or philosophers but this was fascinating,2
bit at the end made me wonder if im merely a computer great episode john,2
unlike most cs introductions crash course does a great job in giving the student context explaining how computers function at a fundamental level before applying layers of abstraction very well done as a sophomore computersci major im excited to see more enriching content every week,2
just passing by to say that im loving her course and excellent diction,2
just wanted to say i love the themed animations for this series the computer ui old mac os ui etc always great work to the animators and team,2
a good video as always as a cs major myself this is actually finally a series where i can answer questions and stuff in the comment section just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info there are also not versions of all the gates and or and xor become nand nor xnor respectively they are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate while they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts you often here people verbally nand and xnor when talking about logic so i think it is interesting to note even though this isnt computer engineering while by convention in truth tables is true and is false this is often not the case when we actually look at real components because of power usage the opposite is often used generally the more common output is set to doesnt actually mean nothing is flowing through for example we may set our to volts and our to volts this allows for us to have an off state at volts we wouldnt want our computer to be calculating stuff with s when it is off there are also other uses for this state but this may be covered in a future video,2
oh my god thank you for clearly explaining how each logic gate is physically represented in an electrical circuit a lot of that abstraction makes it really daunting and hard for dummies like me to get it through our thick heads,0
my first real exposure and application of logic gates was in minecraft with redstone,2
advice to all beginner programmers computer science is not that hard it just takes time and effort,2
we dont want over qualified students to intimidate others wow thats the best and honest thing i ever heard from a professor no wonder mit is a top institution the level of deliverance of education is way too perfect,2
this dude is an absolute legend spitting wisdom and working the class like a bad crowd on an open mic night and the thumbs down are from unemployed harvard students,2
this is amazing who could have thought that one day i can just sit at my home in another continent and at the same time to attend an mit course fascinating thank you,2
course starts at,1
wow mit professors are much more engaging than my local state college,2
i know i can never get in to mit so this is such a useful free resource for people like me who want to get into comp sci taught by masters thank you so much i plan on getting either a second bachelors in comp sci first one in music or masters if possible,2
i learn more here than in my actual lectures at uni this is great also i love videos because you can pause and go back if you need to,2
this is beautiful thank you mit ocw and thank you professors grimson and guttag for the clear and concise lectures,2
these professors seem awesome my college professors make me feel like im in high school again with docked points for not showing up even if you have an a kind of hard to not miss a day when you work and have a family,2
no experience necessary internship opportunities job market salary upon graduating skills learned apply to job empowerment,1
i just graduated with honors in computer science in september and i already landed a really cool software engineering job at a big and prestigious tech company so excited,2
i like the positivity you bring into computer science im going into my second year and i am really enjoying the major so far great videos,2
i m currently in my senior year of hs and planning to major in cs i ve been programming on and off for about years and plan to be a software engineer your videos are great man,2
im a senior computer science student and i have been programming ever since i was although i definitely agree that computer science is the best major ever maybe the best that ever existed but the problem i see that a lot of people are getting into computer science just for the money or just for the fact it is really popular right now and not for the fact that they are interested in computers and technology in general,2
last year i was in my second year of med school and i dropped out cuz i figured out that its not for me and then i decided to study cs because its the major ive been always interested in and since then a lot of people been pointing at me as a failure but i know that im not i really needed such positivity especially in the meanwhile thank you,1
i love how people have interships in big companies like microsoft google etc and in my country there s no companies like those i live in venezuela a very poor country i only want to have my degree and get out of this shithole,0
diversity of options man you can work on so many things as a programmer super exciting fields like games or movies there are jobs in solar and basic betterment of mankind or like facebook and google for money,2
im contemplating transitioning from the military and have been doing a ton of research in computer science i have a bachelors degree in management but have coursework in aerospace engineering but only got as far as calc ii i didnt realize you could go for a masters in a different subject like you did how did you find that experience changing professions how was the application process,1
i m doing cs to be a software engineer currently in nd year of college,2
im a computer engineering student going to nd year now so far we have tackled computer system servicing programmingc java and other minor and major engineering subjects i have no experience with programming but i was able to do just fine calculus was the only hard subject i took so far which is offered in every engineering courses we are going to tackle more about electronics robotics and computer architecture in the higher years so if youre feeling to take computer engineering go ahead its a good degree,2
cs software ce hardwaresoftware both can get same jobs but ce can also get jobs in hardware devolpment,1
i was a computer science major but i switched to computer engineering last year there really isnt much programming after your first semesters in cs after that its all theory which is great for the few that want to work in academia computer engineering actually allows me to apply my learned programming skills to projects whether inside or outside of class this is why i made the switch and have no regrets,2
i m an excs and mathstats student who actually just switched his double major to actuarial science and mathsstats the reason being was because i found out that cs is only about programming the rest of it is theory of cs and various other theoretical mathrelated cs courses like advanced algorithms and theory of computation which i m personally not interested in if you really don t find a lot of interest in algorithms data structures and theory of cs as viable as it is this major may most probably not be for you if you love programming but don t find the indepth cs stuff interesting i d encourage you to instead selfteach programming or go through a coding bootcamp computer programming is only a tool in cs like math is a tool in physics,0
both are s or a tier degrees honestly so anyone who picks either of them will be fine great salary and job growth thanks for the videos as always shane,2
i just graduated high school and was stuck between choosing ce and cs thank you for the perfect timing you should compare these with electrical engineering,2
i actually dropped out of cs the first time around i had no idea what i was getting myself into lol i stomped it later in life though,0
hey shane love your videos can you make a video on the best specializations to go into for computer science,2
i chose a computer science with software engineering degree and the doors of opportunity have been opening ever since,2
imposter syndrome is so real i think that ties back in a lot to your first question all of us out here have imposter syndrome because we dont realize everyone else is working so hard,0
currently a bio major on a pre med track covid had me rethinking my career choices this past year and now looking at switching to computer science this was some really good insight thank you,2
i appreciated this so much the problem im having is knowing where to focus i am a jack of all trades when it comes to most things i do and i feel so overwhelmed looking at job descriptions that require different skills all relating to computer science there have been a couple things that i really enjoyed but they didnt relate to coding as much which makes me question if this was right for me all i can do is continue practicing in areas that interest me and look for a job that asks for that,2
oh my goodness i needed this video for years i graduated years ago i have also struggled with imposter syndrome in recent years i finally started vocalizing that i didnt enjoy coding i felt like a rather intelligent person until i got into the deep coursework of my computer science degree i love how honest and open you are about this and its going to help so many students who are currently in the thick of this difficult degree,2
im about to enroll in a cis program i wanted to know studying tips and useful tools to help me get better at coding and what i should expect to study i really appreciate your help im trying to be more confident and believe i can do this,2
that was soo helpful thank you soo much and i never knew this syndrome was a thing but just you talking about it made me fear the major so much more knowing that ive gone through this so much during school and college feeling like the dumbest one in class ill take your advice and thanks for letting me know im not alone,2
thank you so much for sharing your insights into comp sci im starting my degree this september and your video definitely helped me prepare for what to expect,2
hi first of all great video i m a freshman in my second semester of computer science and i m kind of struggling i definitely feel the imposter syndrome and i want to practice more but i m not sure where to look i ve only learned a bit of java so far and i was going thru leet code and couldn t really find anything for java do u have any recommendations,0
this was so helpful thank you so much for sharing from your heart and being so encouraging you are meant to be what you want to be,2
i m kinda undecided on my major i ve thought about optometry but i don t want to do years of school my mom and dad are software engineers but it s never really been my passion do you think a cs degree is worth it like especially with jobs and stuff after graduating are you able to still enjoy or have free time,0
here s a story for you beginners i went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding i got a c in intro to java okay yeah i did bad but then i wanted to get better so i did some practice over the winter to improve my logic okay b in the next highest class the following semester software then over the summer i was able to learn so many other languages swift python javascript i had all this growth in a little under a year all i m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn t know how to code and don t think it will get easier trust me it gets easier do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like it else s while for loops etc to help you gain a feel of how they work i would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java as a beginner this is a daunting task for me so over winter break i made projects such as modeling a car in java okay what functions does a car have accelerate decelerate break etc from then i could think of variables okay what could toggle a car being on or off oh a boolean oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero okay that s loop there with gas level modeled as an int see things like this slowly helped my logic grow and now i can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me trust me i m still a beginner as well but i ended up catching up to the kids around me when i was once behind and in times when you feel like giving up please don t i urge you to stick through it because it does get easier,2
as someone who s graduated and has been in the field for a couple of years this guy is giving some really good advice that i wish i would ve had when i first started,2
i would add two things work in group as often as possible have a hobby that you can enjoy without having to stare at a screen,2
your classmate are not betterworse this really motivate me because i felt like everybody in my class have experience in coding and stuff and afraid to be left behind now i felt more confident thank you,2
on the first point i had been coding since th grade and i had plenty of classmates who hadnt coded ever when i started college for those of you in the latter position we dont judge your for not knowing programming we are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you i love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying you dont need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you arent a flawless coder we arent either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well and we want to help you get to that point as well were all at school to learn and if i can help others i will i hope once i get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things you cant be the best at everything also for the book thing as a math major double majoring i have a nagging need to buy every book for every class they are expensive but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and cs textbooks in my room i am willing to skip on a game or two for a textbook both provide me with entertainment because i am weird lol,2
here is my story i m currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year i started off with the basics of c for a few months then i moved on to python i m currently a python intermediate and now i started learning java i think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects i was fascinated by the cool games and projects i can create and that made programming even more enjoyable to me i would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club as suggested in this video because you can help each other out and build projects together i personally wasn t able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code,2
hey man i just started my computer science journey at ucf about a month ago and i was wondering if you ever found a specific time during the day or night where you find yourself to be the most efficient with coding in other words do you have a time during the day where you just shut everything down and force yourself to just stop programming for the day or is it usually different for you every day i loved this video i really related to feeling pretty lost my first weeks as i had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things my professor for my intro to c class has been constantly repeating that of the learning in this class will be outside of the classroom and i have found that to be some real truth,2
intro your classmates arent better or worse focus solely on your coursework coffee question join a club attend hackathons learn computer science terminology dont cram or procrastinate dont buy a book unless you need it outro i know you took my job but here i m,0
good to have you back forrest ive been following you since i started chasing my degree i am now coming up on the completion of my associates in computer science and math from my community college and then transferring to a university to chase a bachelors i feel like i know barely anything about coding because all of my general education classes are so demanding did you feel this way i am really looking forward to only learning programming and computerfocused information because although i am finally in a java class chemistry is kicking my ass and takes all my time thanks,2
definitely wish this was made when i first started my degree the little bit and pieces of knowledge always manage to add up great video as always,2
went through all of these during my first year at university i know it may seem complicated here or really difficult but it honestly isnt if you want to study cs or computer engineering or something like this dont let this keep you from doing that dont be afraid by thinking its going to be too difficult or whatever i promise its not,1
i dont even feel upset anymore for having my data stolen they earned it they win,1
in a room with people can everyone shake hands with people no theres a pandemic,0
i love how this is aimed at people who just finished high school far too many videos aim somewhere else say a postelementary level or a postcollege level,2
in a few years there will be a video titled the computer science you need for doing math,1
high school students who want to go to stem majors in college should watch your videos you cover subjects indepth with practical examples this is what is lacking in the majority of careermajor prep videos on youtube the other channels would say you need to know math but are not really specific like you it would be interesting to know how many students saved time and money by not having to switch majors because they picked the wrong major in their freshman year thank you,2
when u finally finish learning the quadratic formula,1
if you play the video at speed he seriously sounds like a valley girl with an attitude,0
its not only about math knowledge its about the way of thinking,1
in a room with people can everyone shake hands with people yes without further clarified restrictions everyone has the opportunity to shake hands with people,1
read the written interview by sheon han in quanta magazine,1
this dude also created latex a software that is commonly used to write mathematics impressive individual,2
no question about it this guy is a genius the idea of using a physicsbased notion of time like that of relativity and using that as a metaphor to guide his work in distributed systems and its notions of timing is a really powerful and original way of thinking,2
im not clever enough to understand the problems this man solved but am glad he did,2
i am proud that i stumbled on it this statement itself says how humble he is,2
this man did more for mankind than thousands of others did yet he is still humble but also wholesome and full of soul love it,2
lamports turing award in was probably one of the most overdue turing awards glad to see his foundational work and the whole field better recognised with such an interview,2
i feel like the most important thing hes said there is coding is to programming what typing is to writing if you learn to program by learning to code you essentially only know how to type this this is something i always try to convey but never found the right words for it ill be using that analogy for sure d,2
it s certainly a honour to hear about this amazing groundbreaking work but i am even more astounded by his humbleness and honesty hats off to you sir,2
one of the markers of true genius is thinking in an interdisciplinary fashion in my opinion this man has demonstrated only in this short time that he has knowledge of art mathematics and physics its no surprise he contributed to our world in the way he has,2
wow years have passed ashley gavin is a great comedian and an amazing podcast host crazy to see where people come from,2
the less people going into computer science the more the people calling me a genius,0
this ted talk encouraged me to go into computer science now im in my second year in college and i love it,2
studying computer science is my dream due to circumstances i unfortunately couldnt study it i am still trying my best to learn a little about it through online courses while working,1
i think shes talking about software engineering education not computer science education math is an integral part of computer science because math is the language of science if you took math from computer science by definition you took science out of computer science which is quite bizarre,0
wow this was amazing watching and would like my instructor to be like her she is to the point and understands that needing more programmers i am just getting started and it is all about problem solving,2
computer science is a medium for problem solving and selfexpression ashely gavin i like her definition,2
the first ted talk ive seen in years that was good even great there were some inaccuracies about cs but note that the vocabulary varies by region school and nation if definitions were your main takeaway then the video is not meant for you,2
i did python tutorial after python tutorial and none of it ever stuck it wasnt until it really mattered at my job that i was pushed to learn basic computer science principles and not long after that python and i love every single part of it,2
although she s wrong about the math part i definitely believe that professors like to make learning cs harder than it should be,0
update i switched my major to mathematics i guess cs was not for me xd,0
it took me like years to get my undergraduate i felt dumb all the time im glad pushed through im a data engineer and a lot of the stuff i found impossible before is easy now i graduated with a gpa a lot of my teachers and the dean tried to convince me to change my major but i never gave up practice makes perfect,2
the math shouldn t scare you away i was terrible at math i just applied myself and made it not bad at all it just takes effort,2
its theres no way youre bad at computers youve clearly never worked in tech support,0
cs is combination of math physics statistics and algorithms there is a famous quote that computer science is as much about computers as astronomy is about telescopes,1
you lost me at mathheavy thank you for this information considering choosing another degree now,2
im a first year cs student at a major german university and my current classes are introduction to programming computer architecture automata theory calculus and linear algebra i went into it not having a background in cs at all i really only went into it because i have a thing for logic and structure and i dont regret my decision at all at the beginning i was worried because i didnt know how to code at all and i had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but its totally possible,0
a cs degree is basically a math major with some programming if you plan on taking cs make sure u actually enjoy it rather than doing it for the money,1
cs requires a person who is patient persistent creative in solutions basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done thats how you can know further as you grow into cs you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem even if not from this field think research learn craft every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps you will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed and its ok because you also learn that progress is through error after error only for the new problem to come to you and apply the same process you already can handle being overwhelmed,2
to add to this cs is also a major for those who like to practice outside the classroom i am a current cs major at lawrence technological university and the majority of my programming practice came from implementing the techniques taught in class to personal projects outside of the curriculum i believe this is an important element to the cs degree path in order to get really good,2
i cant believe this is free online to watch and learn you guys are doing great things i deafinetly want to be a computer scientist now,2
this series is a great addition to learning computer science ie learning syntax logic algorithms it gives context to everything besides its fascinating,2
small bug in pseudo code for selection sort at third from bottom line should say swap array items at i and smallest currently it says to swap items at index and smallest since index would be at the end of the array whenever that line is executed as it is after the inner forloop this would swap the last and smallest elements rather than putting the smallest element in its correct position,1
odds of a developer being asked to write an algorithm as part of a coding interview odds of same develop ever writing an algorithm in their job as opposed to reusing a system library,1
loving the series cc does anyone know any reference material where one can learn these algorithms,2
ah yes the graph depthfirst vs breadthfirst search i also quite enjoyed the binary search tree bst really fascinating field of algorithms and data structures,2
this video was incredibly well done this lady is really great at teaching material in a clear easytofollow manner,2
ive always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we as humans seem to sort things it seems like were much more efficient than many of the algorithms at least the ones ive seen which is admittedly few for example when we look at all the items we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once eg oh i remember that was the smallest before i found the actual smallest so thats the second smallest let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook i know computers are still faster in the end but i suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency anyone know if thats true has anyone made a human sort algorithm so to speak that sorts the way we do including our little tricks im guessing no if not are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two like the one i just described,2
just a few things to note about the bigoh notation discussed in this episode in industry bigoh notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms however in academia it is a bit more in depth on is instead used to represent an upperbound in the worst case what is this problem or algorithm n pronounced bigomega is used to represent the lowerbound in the best case what is this problem or algorithm n prounounced theta without the big is used to represent the tightbound used when the bigoh is equal to the bigomega which is the exact running time there is also small omega and small o but those are rarely used also we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation so if a problem takes n n to do we just say it is n we drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big you may notice that earlier i mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation this is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem for example for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix we have n since we know that we at least need to read in n values this problem currently has on which is the running time of an algorithm created by francois le gall in,1
in school i had to write a bubble sort in bit intel asm it worked was efficient and was well documented it got me an a even like years later i am so damn proud of that piece of code d,2
we got ourselves a in video with one of those parts talking about the in laptop lol i swear i just thought of that hope yall enjoy edit if you are considering the lg gram check out the new one with the th gen intel cpu and the new intel evo series to learn all about that check out my new video,2
i had a tutor and a friend student that excelled in classes the tutor is doing well but my friend is now deceased beaten to death as a street person on drugs the tutor that helped me told me that the reason one goes to school is to learn to teach yourself if university does not teach you to teach yourself you have failed because if you cant teach yourself you can not teach others what you have learned i have this discipline in my agenda on full and have helped other students in the past,1
cant stress making more cs friends enough,2
as a college student this video was really great for me with everything happening due to covid it really slowly made me lose my desire to immerse in cs and i didnt fully realize it until i heard you say it thanks for all the advice you put out,2
out of all the tech youtubers i know i really think forrest gives the most practical advice for getting in the industry thank you for that,2
youre one of the best and most favorite computer science programming mentors of all time forrest i really cherish all your videos man youre godsend,2
what you need to succeed in cs a laptop a calculator a good ide and the ability to think in abstract terms thats it,2
i wish that i had a video like this when i was at university seven years too late unfortunately but even so this video is still useful for learning computer science and programming through online courses like at the moment,2
hi forrest thanks for making all these videos about cs it s really helpful for me i am about to take my cs degree next year i m planning to get internship during my years of college degree do you think this is possible,2
your content is a clear demonstration of how much passion and energy you put in making these videos thanks for such awesome content,2
i was unable to take admission to an engineering college to pursue software engineering due to my financial conditions but i never lost hope i am studying on my own self and i feel privileged that i came to know about your channel thank you so much for such valuable content,2
if everyone was like you study wouldnt not be tough thank you for this video and graph theory explanation what you made is not just knowledge but enlightment for me you do it like its a cake to you and i actually understand your explanation,2
this is a great channel definitely will get much more recognitions in the future,2
this is by far the best video regarding graph theory i have seen in my quite long life extremely clear extremely accurate and extremely useful as einstein newton here said months ago this can be considered the blue brown of computer science congratulations,2
introduction why study graph definition terminologies types of graph representation graph problems,1
blue brown of computer science brilliant video,2
there is a small mistake at you would need to connect every point on a column with every other point on the same column same for the rows otherwise a graph coloring algorithm wouldnt work here since graph coloring algorithms only test for the constraint that each neightbor has a different color,0
dude the way of explained this topic is so amazing and you made it look so easy to understand it is so hard to understand this topic from books for someone like me thanks alot for your help god bless,2
beautifully explained and easily understandable to someone who knows little to nothing about graph theory or computer science keep up the good work,2
this is going to be one of the most popular study channel in the future,2
this day in the life video felt really refreshing compared to most other day in the life videos seems like a great mix of both productive grinding and fun hangouts with friends keep it up d,2
my boy is a fully fledged celebrity glad to watch another one of your videos,2
hey nick the vibe amongst your friends and you is great love this video,2
hey nick good video ive been a software dev for a while and i got to say your vlog just confirmed that university hasnt changed since i was there its really nice to see the perspective of a studentjunior dev helps keep me up to date on how you guys feellearnthink when i see you for an internship or your first job so dont give up on youtube man its way more useful than you might think good job while im at it feel free to reach out if you ever want a second opinion on some of your code it will be my pleasure,2
dude all the walking back forth to get those shots of you walking haha props to you man,2
nicholas t is the best youtuber ever every one of his videos brings a smile to my face,2
watching this makes me miss my first uni years had so much fun,2
what do you think about waterloo cs proceeds to ask the one guy who isnt in waterloo cs,1
the waterloo campus looks beautiful really makes me want to visit,2
man i love how wholesome ur friends are,2
your videos are insane the amount of effort that goes into compiling all this information making it digestible for the average viewer and also having it be interesting on top of that the insane amount of editing and graphic work to make it coherent and fun to watch youre going places man love it,2
i m currently studying compilers and language design i make programming languages basically and your explanation of highlevel languages to assembly was very good it was simple and easy to understand i m definitely yoinking it,2
as a cs major this is amazing work i particularly liked the part about graphics rendering the explanations are not only consistently clear they are concise which is a nontrivial feat,2
i wish more people appreciate the insane amount of effort went into making this video the writing scripting animating editing voicing absolutely brilliant,2
just an extra note about using sha for passwords while it can be used its often not the best choice sha was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords for a password hashing algorithm you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users that way an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing as of right now the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon id both of which were designed to be slow,1
as a computer science student i love the fact that theres no clickbait you know your topic and explain it very clearly you earned yourself a new subscriber,2
crazy amount of info explained here we use these almost every day yet most people have no idea how they work,1
even knowing most of this information the way you simplify it and make it so clear is really impressive this is super well made and entertaining,2
for the randomness section we dont use time anymore we use cpu activity or noise entropy patterns etc as well as modulo arithmetic and state transition functions,1
its insane that you have videos and are doing this well that just proves that your content is amazing keep it up,2
ive been stuck in tutorial hell for so long at the moment i can code any mockup in html and css and javascript is a challenge i deleted every tutorial on my pc and decided to take this course week blew my mind the problem solving approach is what i love it teaches you to problem solve and build things on your own,2
strongly agree when i started my journey as a programmer cs was my first course and i learned everything online from net ninja tutorials w schools clever programmers and so on now i am a mobile and web app developer yeah i can say it is possible to learn computer science without a degree and im self taught software engineer too buddy,2
great video as a beginner programmer i agree with most things you say one unspoken rule of programming is to google everything you dont understand its simply the only way one learns,2
i totally agree with him before joining this course i couldnt even attend a min class in my uni with my full conscious but i attended their first class of approx hours with full interest so if you want to learn python or web or ai or cs basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try its worth it,2
yes this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding for anyone thats getting deeper into learning web dev stuff i highly recommend scrimba it has a great problemsolving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what youve learned together instead of just showing you the solution first theres also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloudbased coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so its very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor you can pause it at any time and directly edit the code thats being written during the tutorial,2
first of all congratulations youve earned around subs in the last hours from k to k second of all i love your content and the fact that youve encouraged me and many others to take this course is amazing ive been doing frontend for months now and sometimes i struggle with some programing concepts in javascript soim enrolling now,2
ive been taking the course and im still on lecture good to hear positive reviews reinforcing my experience so far ill come back and update this when i finish,2
i started it a few years ago and went to week but started working solo and never came back to it i never stopped thinking about it as the lectures are really great and their approach is very refreshing i will definitely take it again back to week,2
i tried attempting cs when i was man it was a roller coaster some lessons were extremely easy to understand but some were hard for the small mind of a year old fast forward years i m attempting it again and am currently on my th week,2
years old long story short took a programming elective and now im here my father told me that once i learn to programspecifically python and learn some sense of web design and development he ll hire me hes an it director right below the owner of the company,2
free course links below menu introduction cisco certs as the standard and why programming doesnt have an equivalent computer science as the way to get into programming computer science doesnt make you a master programmer why the system is broken the role of universities in the future of education the first half of the path to master programmer the second half of the path to master programmer what is a master programmer david and dr chucks experiences with programming courses at university brief overview of the origin of computer science and what went wrong when dr chuck teaches recursion but doesnt the system actually work just look at google and facebook the idea for google wasnt good enough for a phd how to fix the system the last nut to crack open sources role you cant apply until you have run the gauntlet you can start now the value of mentors the problem with online platforms why cisco is the standard in networking every course dr chuck teaches requires him to write code quick summary for the plan for the master programmer whats the cost going to be education is for everybody not just the rich final thoughts thanks dr chuck my stuff social discord twitter instagram linkedin facebook tiktok youtube dr chuck social website twitter youtube coursera python for everybody free python course on coursera youtube python for everybody free python book dr chucks website free python book options django for everybody website coursera youtube web applications for everybody youtube website coursera internet history coursera youtube sponsors interested in sponsoring my videos reach out to my team here sponsorsdavidbombalcom,1
dr chuck is a legend,2
i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,0
wow what a guest i was listening to this guys lectures on python last year he has a knack for explaining complex things in a very simple way,2
david was my motivation not to give up ever not that long ago i was working on a farm and listening his ccna courses today im managing production servers and complete industrial network infrastructure and got involved in the software development as c dev only by folowing one rule that tomorows myself shall be proud of todays myself thank you david,2
dr chucks python course is literally how i got started with my career in tech and software engineeringdevops engineering its the same course that i always recommend to people who are looking to get into programming and building a career in tech great interview man really cool to hear you guys sharing your experiences,2
as a professional engineer i really appreciate your direct tech channel no bs david it is good to hear dr chuck as i stand firm with him as i also teach tech in my free time while i work in tech fulltime i hope entrylevel folks see this,2
i took his courses and he is an amazing teacher nice interview,2
what he said around is a life lesson i always remind my kids learning what not to do is still learning also as a master peanut butter and jelly builder i can also attest that computer science is not important in becoming a master peanut butter and jelly builder,1
absolutely love this i was familiar with dr chuck as an academic and i may have even taken part of his course i spent yrs teaching programming in a computer science programme and he is right,2
hope yall enjoy the video,2
my it teacher in school used to phrase it if you can kick it it s hardware,1
bro as a newbie this video is exactly what i needed there are so many terms to keep up with and you perfectly explained all of the basics great video my man,2
this is hands down the best explanation for programming lingo i have ever heard i wish somebody would have shown me this in when i started my mathematics degree would have saved me months of frustration down the line you sir are a saint thank you so very much,2
thank you for the basics im new to the tech field and at first it can all seem overwhelming but its really not you helped with that,2
more videos like this please it was precise fun and easy to understand,2
what an awesome video loved how you covered everything thanks,2
thanks for the video i learned so much about code and debuging the bugs in the code im taking online classes because of covid and its really complicated to apply for one because im not techsavvy but you sir made it easier to understand thanks again,2
that was great where do you recommend we go from here to learn all of the programming terminology like iterations etc anyone feel free to recommend a video for me below thanks in advance,2
one of the best videos i ve watched on youtube so complete wasn t what i was looking forgotta get more accurate at searching but i m subscribing to your content because i learned the most watching this video and took notes thank you my good man wonderful day to you,2
woahhh scroll up and smash that like button then go start an argument in the comments checkout my computer science only channel,1
yo bro i just wanted to say thank you im going into cs at cornell next semester and your videos really motivated me to get to the position im in today i watch all your videos bro much love,2
amazing video man don t know how this video doesn t have millions of views you provided some really useful information here and i appreciate it a ton i m getting out of the military soon and trying to navigate this college stuff for the first time and tips like these give me a lot of motivation,2
really important advice just do what you love in the end we all are just humans living in this life,2

one of your best videos hands down,2
watching this because i plan to shift to a cs course from ab psych,1
this series has made me seriously consider computer science as a possible degree optionthanks guysgals of crashcourse,2
as a software engineer i cannot help but be amazed at how you managed to break the information down clearly and logically to its most important components while still being completely excited and in awe of the stuff you are talking about my old professors and teachers could seriously learn a thing or two from you,2
her enthusiasm while taking about unicode is inspiring,2
shes awesome the people behind the animations and editing dont get the recognition they deserve either really high quality stuff,2
i find this so compulsively watchable even though it features math john,2
programmer here who finds this series seriously interesting its also nice to see very informed tutor and friendly way she covers subjects in details keep up the good work,2
correction when discussing the prefixes it would have been more uptodate to talk about how kb used to be bytes but its now bytes and the old measurement is now known as the kibibyte or kib,1
man so much love for this series never has encoding or unicode been so exciting also we cannot stress enough how absolutely revolutionary it is for both our operations and the objects of our operations to be encoded basically in the same way the algorithm that encodes your mp and the encoded file itself are written with ones and zeroes in a digital context nothing is really subsymbolic anymore everything is written,2
thank you so much im years old and finally binary system makes sense to me so pleased feels like learning a new language in minutes,2
my brain hurts and my decision to watch of these at am is still not regreted,0
i learned this stuff years ago and this is the first time it was ever presented to me so clearly,2
now i know how ram actually stores bits now i can die in peace great content,2
it completely blows my mind that we can build all of this much less make it the microscopic size we do,0
i am a computer science major and currently i am learning assembly language my professor is pretty terrible he doesnt really explain anything he just skims over power point slides but these crash course videos have helped me so much and made me understand how the cpu ram and the computer works in general and about the interactions between different components i am really thankful for these videos they also help me understand how my code is interpreted line by line and executed by the computer the relationship between software and hardware is just really beautiful the humans who came up with the computer and improved upon it are really some next level geniuses,2
basically a computer is just a grid of switches composed of carefully organized sand,1
this episode is ridiculously wellwritten,2
with every episode ive been able to say so thats how that works at the end of it cant wait until next wednesday,2
me wow that s a lot of ram modules anne this is from the s me oh,1
i seriously cannot get enough of this this is so cool thank you so much to crashcourse i am blown away by this,2
this is an absolutely incredible way to teach computing i love the emphasis on layers of abstraction,2
you should consider it me who consider every major i hear about,1
me realises at the fifth question that the quiz has started,1
would love to see weighted questions on tests like these,2
you should add are you willing to sell your soul to understand algorithms,1
i am so excited i am a sophomore in high school and feel in love with computer sciences back in th but now i have finally been able to use my logic skills to make many projects and started building my portfolio it has been a great trip and i cant wait until i get better,2
after years of studying computer science ive realised its not the right major for me unrelated to this quiz got points btw maybe i should have taken this quiz years ago,0
thanks a lot i had chosen computer science as one of my optional subjects and i got an in this which definitely made me feel more confident about my choice,2
could you make one for physicsspecifically astrophysics or quantum mechanics ive already decided to have my career in physics just wanted to see how many other people would want to as well,2
programming can be incredibly creative and selfexpressive its just not taught this way in most colleges unfortunately like its unlocking the full power of a computer so you can make it do literally whatever you want also problem solving requires a lot of creativity and lateral thinking generally,2
when i took my exams so i can get in a university i really wanted to study architecture or art however things didnt go well and my score was extremely low so i was left with a few options one of them was computer science and telecommunications and tbh despite the fact that i had zero interest in programming before i freaking love this major so much sure its hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works,2
andrew tanenbaum books on cs helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications,2
my biggest tip if youre a computer science student and have the chance it was not required at my college to take software engineering make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because thats what youll be doing most of cs is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies agile which is just old school rad with more crap to have to deal with waterfall spiral etc etc will give you a better idea of what youll be doing on the day to day youll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what youre tasked with at work but the software engineering portion youll use anywhere you go,1
this is so informative ive been a little on the fence about getting into cs but i love how challenging it is this video really helped answer alot of question i had i cannot thank you enough,2
hey everyone after some years of experience i know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills a few days ago i had a very interessting nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years the question which fascinated me the most was how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier the reason why i tell you this is because i am very exited about your opinion on this topicespecially the following questions would interest me the most as programmer what are were the biggest issues you re dealing with regarding your programming skills what would you wish for more than anything else thanks so much in advance looking forward to reading your answers,2
thanks great advice just starting out pursuing a ba cs after being out of school for years i have been having a similar dilemma i originally signed up for software development but my counselor said i should do cs since i said i want the ability to be hands on on top of developing not sure if i am thinking too big but thanks great video,2
to hear that you didnt have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position i really didnt have any experience with code other than html and felt behind because other student because half of them either smarter or extremely experienced with the area,2
came for computer science stayed for the glorious hair and beard,2
i go to odu so do you actually feel like you learned a lot in i havent taken it yet but a lot of people ive talked to say its massively outdated and just a ton of busy work i understand that can help you practice discipline but was it useful any other way in getting ready for your career,1
so my university currently has both software engineering and computer science both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about or classes for example for the data structures and algorithms course there is cis theory based and cis se side of the class also the core requirements has se majors take se after se while cs majors only take se so its really the same degree same requirements only difference is a couple of classes that are very similar,1
hey forrestknight what would be the best way to explain to a year old the concept of classes and objects,1
thanks to curiositystream for sponsoring this video if you want to watch their content and support the channel while doing so go to and use code reducible to get access for year,2
i know the optimal algorithm for a graph with two nodes,1
sometimes things have to get worse before they get better i didnt expect life wisdom to come from a video on heuristic optimization algorithms a surprise to be sure but a welcome one,1
tsp is a np hard problem but so is making this video every seconds of the video i see an exponential effort invested thank you so much,2
in the s i used a different strategy to solve this problem just for my satisfaction i based my solution on the way nature would create an inner expanding bubble until touching all the nodes with minimal tensional energy i used basic in an pc with about random nodes a short program with less than lines of code was enough to get satisfactory results edit minor grammatical correction english is not my first language sorry for that,1
from the wikipedia page titled ant colony optimization algorithms they have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time this is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems this reminds me a lot of the youtuber pezzzas work his ants simulation videos make sure to watch that it is analogous to the market speedrunning anything really,2
been excited for this video for awhile i ve heard of tsp superficially many times but never got a deep dive like this before very motivated exceptionally beautiful and naturally narrated content like this is the gem of youtube just to add as impossible as this problem is it s wild to know we have a record solution with a tour length of billion,2
im quite impressed that you managed to avoid mentioning entropy while discussing the annealing approach and the pheromone approach i once tried to explain pheromone optimization to a friend of mine who wasnt familiar with using entropy to backtrack a search and i simply wasnt able to explain the process well done,2
pspace problems common in planning are arguably harder as tsp is only nphard,0
i did a report in linear algebra discussing using adjacency matrices to find paths from any point to any other point by raising matrices to their power step by step i managed to make it work for minimum hop count and shortest path between two points unfortunately it doesnt solve the tsp because it does not go back to it starting point only that it can hit every point we had another idea of using something similar to what we called gravitic weighting to image creating the shortest path by picking any point and then lifting it and seeing the other points fall based upon distance we ran into problems with pruning of ineffecient routes if we could identify routes that were not going to be used we think it would have worked unfortunately our advisor didnt seem to care to help us at all to him tsp was just an impossible problem and we were waisting our time,1
what is the age limit,1

grace hopper is awesome in so many ways but not for coining the term bug bug meaning a technical problem had already been in use for several decades s so as hopper recorded in her journal when she taped in that moth it was funny to find the first actual case of a bug being found it was a good joke after a long day at work dealing with problems basically,2
download goodwall for ios and android,1
this is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before i was a freshman data science major last year and i had never written a single line of code i got a c in my intro to java course and i was very disappointed as it was something i really want to pursue i was worried about my performance in the next course software and if my grade would be lower i worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and i ended up finishing with an a in the next course and this was all over the course of one winter break now i m making apps with swiftui and solving data science machine learning problems in python and this was all over the course of a year don t be afraid if you struggle early on it s a part of the journey,0
my advice as someone who just graduated with a cs degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that youre writing too many times i see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesnt work,0
im in th year of my cs studies right now unfortunatelly i needed to realize all of the stuff you mentioned on my own i feel like in some cases it can be a little bit late i just hope somebody would talk to me about this at the beggining i would say to all new cs students this will be harder than you think but the balance is the most important thing,1
i m starting collegeuni this year in the computer science course this was so timely,2
another thing ive found helpful as a cs major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gened classes subjects like history english philosophy etc having a spare level intro to x class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of javapython can really defray the pressure many of these are also just as good when taken online as well,2
great tips i would also like to say that understanding logic is very important my professor really stressed this in my first programming class he said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error i think that he is right unless you can explain every single piece of your code line by line you dont really understand the logic behind it in fact he makes us go to the lab and the ta asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment,2
never say ill do it later when it comes to assignments and projects ill write some more tips later,1
another tip is to take your time dont force yourself into like classes classes majors one elective would be your best friend,1
my advice get into your schools cs discords and class specific discords if they have them or make one if there isnt graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot especially with what proffesors are good and bad they help with assignments and even answer general questions,2
thanks again for the opportunity absolute pleasure working with you guys on this steven npe,2

mins in i am absolutely engrossed loving the concise breakdown much love,2
steven this video was awesome you clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other cs educational videos you definitely earned a subscriber,2
i failed my precalc class my first semester of college i did an easier math class the second semester and passed it im ready to try the precalc again even though i failed the class i learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world math is great im not good at it by any stretch i will still conquer this though,2
the reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard it is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before remembering a few equations like dates in history class nor by just scrapping by office hours are the key to succeess yes but even more important than that you must complete all homework when due and dont ever give up on a single problem then you must practice practice don t study only practice that way you don t just know you have complete understanding about concepts much like pointing out a particular color in the room you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing like identifying red letters s t o p means stop how to approach the problem and what equation formula etc to use tools in a toolbox baby,0
calculus discrete math linear algebra is a must,2
lmao just changed my major to cs and was nervous for the math portion then i realized i m not actually that bad at math and i was making it seem worse than it was don t know if that will change when the semester starts but i m excited gotta say thank you forrest you re the reason i felt confident in changing my major to computer science,2
throughout my life i always viewed math as something negative and sucked at it however during freshman year of college i decided that computer science it is and started out taking basic math classes prealgebra currently i am taking precalculus and will go up to calc what made me get to where i am is the mindset,1
its important to note that it also depends on your college some cs departments like the engineering department requires lot of math while others dont like arts and sciences,1
thanks for the video getting into my first math cs courses and its been challenging but youre absolutely right hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas,2
this is a reall helpful video thanks considering i want to go into cs videos about your process to solving complex problems would be great since im doing pure math in school,2
hey forrest im starting as a freshman in a few weeks and im wondering what your thoughts are on pursuing a computer science degree online as apposed to a physical college any insight would be greatly appreciated,2
i stumbled upon your page a few days ago and i must say its been the best learning experience in terms narrowing down specific areas to focus on excellent content,2
kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving,2
this is really cool my only gripe is that it s only player local and not when wireless and online are playeralthough it s likely frame rate issues hopefully they add player local in the future but other than that the game looks like great fun,2
finally a game that truly gets me on a spiritual level,2
i love that elfilin already has stuff in this game forgotten land was just before this so i was really surprised to see the stage as well as the cosmetics,2
i love the part when kirby is quickly eating the strawberry cake i imagine all this fun stuff from kirby s epic yarn when he couldn t contain himself from a giant cake i don t care either gotta love that cake,2
i love how you can add dream in front of any regular object and make it a powerful kirby artifact,2
ive seen art of foodbased abilities before but not traditional abilities in the style of foods it works unexpectedly well,2
yo this looks soooooo fun the variety of modes cosmetics competitive coop options etc for yayus i also love the attention to detail references like master crazy hand or the hands in some of the menus at needle kirby in a smash bros reference at,2
this looks pretty fun only big let down is it seems to only go up to two players in local splitscreen,2
the pricing is really good here great job nintendo,2
sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in adventure im glad theyre taking that approach with frontiers im optimistic about this one,2
it seems like theyre actually going for a serious story this time i hope they manage to pull it off the cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to i was pretty sold on playing this game but now im really excited also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out i guess itll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later,2
whether or not this sonic plays out to what we want it to be we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game looks great,2
im loving the cyberspace stages and story so far nice to see another island in this trailer too cant wait to get this at christmas maybe itll be one of the few games ive d,2
i really really really hope they dont screw this one up like id like to actually hear good things about a mainline d sonic game made by sonic team thats actually good,2
beautiful finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series the first showcase was strange but this one is definitely better compared to the old one,2
i cant understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls i dont understand how theres such a massive difference,0
i always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game,2
so this actually looks good as long as egghead doesn t come back as another villain pulling the strings looks promising,2
finally a trailer that makes sonic frontiers look exciting,2
tickets for indieland are on sale now,1
the ds is probably my favorite system of all time with access to all ds games and the impressive digital library almost no other system library can compare the library isn t only large it s diverse there are bangers for every genre of game all of this is a portable package,2
i recently started playing kid icarus uprising and apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands i am shocked with how much fun im having with it and im bummed that there hasnt been a sequel made since then,2
love the ds planet robobots true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games would be on my personal list great memories of playing smash run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else,2
fire emblem became one of nintendo s larger series thanks to the ds i don t really play fates or sov anymore but i still find myself revisiting awakening love that game if you can step outside of your completionist mindset you d probably love it,2
i was surprised kid icarus uprising isnt on here i think its the best ds game its a true masterpiece yet again sakurai developed this game too and a lot of his games are gold hes a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games,2
ds just felt so special i didnt expect it but found myself really into pok mon sun and moon i think pok mon refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team and i found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my mismagus held on to the end for me i know it ruins the game for some people the pok mon holding on has a higher rate of stopping ko than the focus band apparently but dont quote me on that but for me it was just want i wanted as a jaded almost year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game,2
smash on ds was a marvel in its own right the fact the ds could handle it and at fps on the og ds was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,2
my favorite series is the dillon s rolling western series i remember going on the eshop to find the last ranger being advertised however i wouldn t get it until i grew up a bit more dillon s character stood out when i am already attracted to stylized games all three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop unless you live in a pal region those games will be lost to time,2
kid icarus uprising is my favourite game of all time the combat is fun the weapons are cool the characters are funny and layered and the story and world building is fantastic its been half the time there was between the last two games in the series but i will gladly wait another years to get more kid icarus goodness,2
i know this will get overlooked but i really wanna give props to the announcer she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement it honestly made me pretty hyped,2
for those who didn t notice the store manager for the locker items is harmony a character that has actually been somewhat present before in the series she s part of the musical band known as chirpy chips that plays all sorts of battle music in splatoon if you look it up she s right there on the album cover,1
i love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours opposite colours for example splatoon orange and blue splatoon pink a green splatoon yellow and purple some of the colours are slight variations such as pink it s meant to be red but pinks a good substitute,2
for those who have questions about this direct you can actually skip the news this time salmon run can be played at any time in rainmaker there are multiple checkpoints now,1
i ll always love splatoon they never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we ve wanted i m just really obsessed because i ve always loved this game since i was little,2
whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise everything was so easily digestible and i m glad new players can find their way even easier she sounded so energetic intrigued and passionate overall this minute direct was beautifully executed,2
im going to miss the idols from splatoon they slayed perfect character design and wonderful personalities i didnt expect we would get three idols big man shiver and frye they seem to have a lot of potential im looking forward to doing story mode too the gameplay must be amazing,2
i was genuinely afraid i thought the game would be identical to the second or even worse but this direct definitely made me change my mind there are crazy news the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games and i love it new weapons story mode that feels spatial practically a free choice of character customization of much more i have no negative comments the only flaw could be a short duration of the story mode which for lone players like me could be a problem but i sincerely hope im wrong,2
the expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans nintendo doesnt just cease to be awful they dont know how to,2
the announcer here and on the direct is so good she sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more i am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg i ve been a fan of splatoon one but i didn t get a hold of the game until splatoon cause i was poor lol i legit can t wait to play this every day,2
i m definitely interested to see harvestella shown off the concept sounds really cool but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work so i m interested to see more,2
itd be nice that even when digital takes over for games that they offer a buy from the manufacturer option where you could order a physical copy online and get it shipped from wherever they made the game because i fully expect digital merchandise to be abusedcapitalized in some way out of favor for the consumer,1
for these kinds of shows i think id prefer a rapidfire series of announcements in minutes followed by a lengthier presentation going indepth into specific games that way those that are interested in a specific title can check out the deepdive of that game in specific after the main presentation,1
wanted to wish everyone a happy wednesday today love watching your video game news everyday jon keep up the great work,2
i am actually kind of looking forward to harvestella its a very pretty game,2
the fact that the version of re that came out was considered marketings worst nightmare shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours,0
after seeing that new splatoon spawning cannon thing for the tenth time i just realized it s how the developers wanted to tackle spawn camping which was a nightmare in the prior games,1
gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift,2
whenever i see a company announce a release date i never take it seriously anymore and almost expect there to be a delay,0
as term of gamescom i was excited for gotham knights villain trailer and the release moving up to october st im still getting day im excited for castillo protocol im excited for sonic frontiers finally getting a release date in november and i loved the new trailer of hogwarts legacy,2
monster hunter rise sunbreak nier automata the end of yorha edition loreleo and the laser eye super bomberman r megaman battle network legacy collection pacman world repac blanc return to monkey island mario rabbits sparks of hope little noah scion of paradise railgrade rpg time the legend of wright sonic frontiers disney dreamlight valley live a live doraeomon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom minecraft legends dragon quest treasures show reel portal companion collection harvestella persona royal persona golden persona portable,1
thank you for adding chapters to your directs,2
this direct genuinely felt like a love letter to the older gamers thats been waiting years for these ports of megaman battle network persona nier etc,2
i will never underestimate a nintendo direct mini partner showcase ever again,2
this was far beyond my expectations it was so surprising and joyful for me to see all major persona games being ported on nintendo switch also some new footage from sonic frontiers ill never underestimate a partner showcase direct again it was best of them all until now,2
this was actually a pretty good direct good job nintendo you surpised me,2
i am highly interested in the megaman collection some of my favorite gba games ever return to monkey island could be interesting and just hearing the music is really nice i like the style but its a pretty big change from what im used to seeing kenta looks really charming and adorable i adore the concept dragon quest treasure seems like a real blast i love being able to fight alongside companions it makes me miss dragon quest monster joker theres a lot of promise coming up but nintendo please it was a huge ds hit please remaster or remake tomodachi life,2
nintendo just put out a better sonic trailer than sega did this should have been the first trailer for the game it makes so much more sense than the weird rollout sega did,2
this might be in the running for the best direct ever so little downtime each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing to wow,2
thank you for finally putting persona on the switch i have been waiting,2
i do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai stealth based ninja weapon diversifies the gameplay quite a bit,2
wellworded and gracefully honest it does like quite the quality title im excited as a hardcore splatoon fan i have hours on so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past years of course it doesnt hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel im hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better,2
the power eggs always had a use you could buy weapons and upgrade them using the power eggs within the single player,1
the graphics actually look a lot smoother more intricate and more polished as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement which is super nice i wasnt expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw but now im happy,2
i wasnt really expecting any new formula for the single player im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned maybe theyll explore new things in the paid dlc from the trailers ive seen your gameplay you get shot onto the stage for turf wars anarchy battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas perhaps thats what made the maps feel bigger cant wait to see how they update the splatoonsplatoon stages,2
i guess in terms of a single player mode for splatoon i was hoping for a bowsers fury type of world where it feels more grand some exploration and seemless transitions into the levels,2
i feel like the biggest sell for splatoon is the timing with the switch being as old as it is now most people have a switch in their home so for kids this is a big buy especially if you havent played it yet but all your friends are playing it i havent played in a few years and im really excited just to chill enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it its a lot easier to sell this game to a japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out as well as the irl concerts with their in game idols,2
my biggest hope for splatoon three is to get it and have fun playing through the waves of content as they tend to be fun and hype as they come out that being said for outsiders of the community i m disappointed and really wish that it gives enough to entice new fans and not just old ones,1
i honestly hope its great considering that splatoon is my personal nd favorite nintendo franchise behind mario,2
i am living for the revolutionary joke gonna be giggling about that for a while great breakdown and honest feedback,2
this looks much better than the first wave waluigis pinball and mushroom gorge make the whole expansion worth it,2
i remember trying to pass the first pinball in waluigi pinball as a young kid the feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great definitely one of my favorite tracks the pinball machine segment the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why it s so popular,2
i m literally hyped for this wave they have waluigi s pinball i do find it interesting that they are also creating completely new tracks as well like the sundae one as most people suspected complete remakes of the originals all in all i m excited,2
i cant watch this without a huge smile on my face wave looks incredible i still cant believe nintendo is bringing back courses spanning the entire mario kart series and updating them for mk dx its like a dream so many great memories with the originals,2
my favorite course from mario kart ds cant wait to race on it this thursday,2
looks amazing waluigi pinball had some electrodrome thrown in,2
sky high sundae new kalimari dessert n mario circuit snes mushroom gorge wii sydney sprint tour waluigi pinball ds snow land gba new york minute tour,1
i think i noticed a pattern cup a tour city track paris and new york a standard track that exists toad circuit and mario circuit an old school classic choco mountain and kalimari desert a mega fan favourite coconut mall and waluigi pinball cup a tour city track tokyo and sydney an unexpected forgotten track shroom ridge and snow land a track with bouncy platforms sky garden and mushroom gorge a tour track probably originally made for mk or vice versa ninja hideaway and sky high sundae,1
this wave looks amazing im amped to play these and relive the past once again i hope they bring koopa cape and peach gardens along the future waves those tracks especially are my favorite tracks to run,2
these courses have made an already star game even better it s great they re including one allnew course per wave too i d love to see some new battle courses at some point though,2
vou comprar o meu nintendo switch esse ano esse canal tem me ajudado e me animando cada dia mais,2
melhor canal sobre nintendo do brasil parab ns coelho continue assim,1
tenho certeza que esse switch vai ficar bonito adoro v deo de modifica o do switch coelho nintendista sem nintendo switch,2
achei que fosse um switch do kirby mesmo mas apesar do oled branco ser lindo esse do kirby tamb m ficou lindo parab ns a finalmente a mary aparecendo em mais v deos,1
ficou muito bonito o switch agora hora de ver o v deo do melhor casal nintendista,2

tudo que do kirby bonito impressionante,1
eu tenho uma pequena inveja do tanto de personaliza o bonita que tem pro oled eu s tenho o switch v e o lite e ainda n o achei personaliza es t o bonitas quanto as do oled twt,1
tem umas capinhas que s de encaixe melhor que esses adesivos assim se enjoar s tirar ou comprar outro case eu tenho um do zelda bem legal,1
im honestly super excited for this game to come out the new fusion mechanic looks crazy the story looks engaging it just looks like a very fun time heres hoping the game thrives edit apparently auto correct likes strives better than thrives,2
this looks insanely good and the battle system with all its complexities makes me go tingly all over i spend so many hours learning all the different blades and how to utilize them in battle in xeno can t wait to get my hands on this new system it looks super interesting,2
what i love about the xenoblade series is their integration of their battle mechanics and story line it hits different,2
this game looked really good i m a non xenoblade fan and checked out this direct and i gotta say it genuinely got me interested in the series i ll definitely check this out if i can buy this game,2
this looks amazing its my most anticipated game of the year xenoblade was such a masterpiece and i cant wait for the next chapter the new battle mechanics look so sick and their is so much variety edit was expecting a typical nopon voice didnt expect riku to sound like such a chad,2
i feel like this is nintendos version of the final fantasy series i hope the xenoblade chronicles continues to expand this will surely keep me busy for a long time,2
ill never get tired of watching this masterpiece direct the game has so much content plus the interlink mechanic is just insane they definitely incorporated a truly amazing mechanic after the driverblade one in xc monolith truly never dissapoints,2
this really feels like a perfect blend between all three previous xenoblade games in terms of gameplay artstyle and world features im starting to really feel it,2
this looks like the most complex battle system i have ever seen layer after layer of options i am giddy after each function shown i cant wait to play this i will have to buy it and play,2
i think xenoblade might be becoming the best jrpg franchise and this game might cement that,2

well im sure this will end up well lol,2
i hope one day people understand gabe newell once said the easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work its by giving those people a service thats better than what theyre receiving from the pirates truer words are yet to be spoken amidst this industry,2
questions does the drm appy to anything played on the switch or just some upcoming titles do i need an internet connection to play on the switch im always connected so i had no idea this might be the case will drm make the switch unusable in another console generation or two,0
this is part of why i stick with the older consoles all these servers network logins and drm stuff just ruins gaming for me i just like popping the game in and playing,0
it will probably not be an online check drm i saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy drm denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if its running in an emulated environment based on their history using kernelmode drm anticheat bs on the pc i would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo,0
the thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more ive had a couple of friends with re on pc that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs x better and for me personally i bought the ultimate version of dying light i really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause i thought my pc couldnt handle it or something but then i tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter i hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch it will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases,0
its also worth noting that the primary assumption behind drm is that people that would pirate a game if theres no drm would legally buy the game if theres drm thats a really absurd assumption most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer and drm gets cracked in only a few months so the pirates need only wait anyway drm does only one thing and thats punish the people that legally buy the game,0
the eff is what i said immediately denuvo does not stop piracy it kills game performance,0
thats exactly what switch games need something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down brilliant,0
man every year that passes im feeling more and more vindicated in emulation and archiving,2
get the games here nintendo switch sports animal crossing new horizons splatoon,1
with the amount of people obsessed with nostalgia these days no one will actually be nostalgic in a few years,0
pikmin are already nostalgic just waiting for to come out and to become nostalgic,2
i agree about splatoon being nostalgic even though ive only been playing since march when u beat the game it feels so good too hear fresh start by the squid sisters,2
ain t no way he said nintendo switch sports is gonna be nostalgic,1
you cannot forget super mario odyssey the music just gives me shivers,1
botw is also gonna be nostalgic,2
the hype around super smash bros ultimate is something i will never forget it,2
the game i m already nostalgic for is botw hearing the theme and watching the trailer just gives me chills,2
nostalgia is a very personal thing that being said i dont ever see myself being nostalgic for nintendo switch sports,0
here s our revisit review of lego star wars with patch hopefully this helps anyone looking for latest information on the nintendo switch version through our all patched up format mark,2
the fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things i love most about your channel while i ll say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do such is the state of the gaming world in you guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible thank you,2
it s easy to be harsh on the switch and the way some ports perform but it s amazing to have full games like this on the move when developers get it right it really sings,2
this is why i love this channel they don t just abandon games at a review,2
i suppose its because i grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesnt really create a negative connotation for me with a game i know that if a game isnt wholly designed for the switch that issues can occur with frame rates pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games i think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to,2
a note for your souldiers revisit while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues the fire temple a late game area is still prone to a lot of crashing when saving at dragon swords it was every time i saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not didnt get any crashes anywhere else so im not sure why that area specifically is so problematic it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch,0
i preordered this and i didn t really notice much of the original issues but i think that s because i was just enjoying the gameplay and i was mainly playing handheld on an oled but it s always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game,2
glad the performance has gotten better on split screen i stomached it the first time through but might return to mess around knew this game had potential on the switch,2
there s so many things that annoyed me about this game and i ended up quitting well before completion i really like games with tight responsive controls where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character s move set this game was like the opposite to that,0
i nearly got completion with this game had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief it took a lot of patience but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped it was frustrating usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet so you had to traverse large areas trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me now im stuck on some backlog games so i dont know if ill ever have completion but maybe one day,0
im so glad that the direction theyre going with when it comes to chaos is pure expression and a sense of warmth rather than falling into the trap of being edgy,2
it almost sounds like a blend of indian japanese and brazilian culture which really brings out the idea of diverse unity and expressionism that chaos is all about i love it,2
i absolutely love how chaos is used instead of being like an apocalypse or something the chaos is presented as a huge jumble of culture love it,2
whoever mixed this song is a genius they managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great all whilst making a genuinely slapping song,2
don t get me wrong the concert vibe from the other games was cool but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing,2
shiver s part sounds like traditional japanese songs big man s part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe frye s part sounds like it s traditional from middle eastern and the chorus sounds like samba i m in love with this song,2
i love the music but another thing i noticed is how different every idol s dance was they had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance,2
the only bad thing about this song is that it ends,0
not sure if anyone else had noticed this but when i rewatched this again i saw that the platforms that shiver frye and big man were standing on actually connect together the bottom part makes up a fish shiver s platform is the head big man s the middle part and frye is the tail very subtle detail i love it,2
i love all the other idol songs but i gotta say this song is the one that feels the most like a celebration it has a cultural festival quality to it,2

now to get ready for gamescom,2
im way more excited to see harvestella than i am for splatoon so im happy theyre going to show it off,2
im not too worried nintendo usually does a direct on september since they need a september direct to promote stuff in time for the holliday season when people get new switches,1
i just read that vr is actually beneficial for eyesight it was an article about some new prescription glasses tech out of japan that uses the same science with how vr headsets seem to improve nearsightedness or prevent at least it from worsening as if i needed another reason to abandon my entire life for vr lol,1
very excited for psvr gonna feel like that big leap in graphics that flat games dont really have anymore because of diminishing returns,2
not necessarily if a september direct came out in the middle or near the end of september it makes sense that it wouldn t cover the already released splatoon and i don t see harveststella gameplay coverage as something that would have gotten significant coverage on a general direct either,1
i actually like that you keep it real and don t scream and shout it s gets a bit scripted and i feel some people do it for the younger audience which is like the equivalent of offering them candy to get in a van,2
let s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative,2
remember that nintendo treehouse works with localisation and translation of games and this is what they are working on at the moment,1
i want to get disced games so i can play them in years but for the rest ye i agree id still get a ps vr for under k knowing sony theyll charge a price thats competitive but makes them money i think about but im sure they did their research and went with what they thought makes them the most money,1
what do you think are we getting closer to a price range you could see yourself grabbing something like this use code beatemups to get off for your first sakuraco box through this link and tokyotreat box through this link,1
honestly the design is pretty nice looking and damn that controller looks so sleek love the white on the console and controller too,2
i like the lights under the joycon control sticks thats what stood out to me the most it really is a nice looking console,2
this convinced me that the switch pro controller needs an all white version because that controller looks so nice,2
the biggest advantage the aya air has over the steam deck is the steam deck isnt available in all countries and regions to buy and this should be so people have the option to get this,2
hmm id still go with the steam deck this is more expensive and looks like it performs worse the only thing going for it is the oled screen plus i think the steam deck will last longer with its powerful hardware and valves continued support plus im not sure how to feel about aya neo they release a new console every months which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run and they were way too expensive and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the steam deck edit should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything i said haha,0
just to note gulikit also makes joystick replacements for the steam deck i saw ltt install it not too long ago and recently picked me up a pair,1
its always a good day when a new beatemups video is published,2
i m in the same boat i exclusively play portably now so much so that i don t touch my ps anymore i m entirely on the switch i dreamt of having the yakuza series being portable and working well but with options like the aya neo steam deck i can have that love this new generation of portable gaming it s insane,2
wood thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller i know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck but still i had never heard of it and i was looking for something like that because believe it or not my pro controllerjoycons all have stick drift so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what i needed especially when its got gyroscope capabilities too i play splatoon so i need gyro and sticks with no drift of course,2
honestly that tricolour three team mode was what sold the game to me its just a shame that its limited to splatfests only i felt like as a mode that was the truly unique and franchisepushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel oh well i guess nintendos servers wouldnt be able to handle it at the moment this is just what splatoon should have been back in to me splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel the tricolour mode was close to that principle but alas its only limited to splatfests otherwise stay fresh is just a quote of sheer irony because splatoon has thus far to me not proven to stay fresh,0
the person who came up with all the fish puns seriously deserves a raise,1
the locker feature the ghost feature and everything else looks so exciting can t wait for this game,2
a lot of folks were hoping for an apartment they could decorate and i feel like the locker feature is a good way to address that without distracting too much from the main game,2
thank god we can finally just queue up with friends on the same team that was the main thing keeping my friends and i from playing more,2
so many quality of life upgrades gameplay upgrades and things the fanbase has been asking for have now been included this game truly is set apart from splat thank you so much nintendo and splat dev team you all did amazing,2
the replay feature is actually pretty fire,2
i already know i m gonna pull something from dancing to these new songs cant wait to play against everyone as team rock amazing job nintendo,2
this game is looking fresher than grocery store produce i love the new aesthetic and weapons plus the new features look really fun i also love how you can customize your character with emotes and lockers it fits perfectly with splatoon,2
only in splatoon games they keep making the foreheads bigger,1
years later still watching without having one,1
i just watch unboxing vids to get that mental high of experiencing something new without actually splurging for it,2
i remember being so giddy and excited for this thing to come out watching videos unboxings gameplay etc seeing this video again brings back some really great memories,2
this is amazing no confusing instructions no details missed except the one were how you take the little controls off and the cool thing is that you didnt stutter it doesnt matter but its just amazing how your explanation went,2
i own a ps but i suddenly have the urge for one of this the red and blue design looks great,2
my brothers have one of each of these and i use them sometimes the only problem weve run into with them is the joycons bugging out with the display he has had to send them in twice for that and they still get that problem but other than that its a great system for us,2
the back is not for speakers its the intake vents for cooling the system and the fan does actually run in handheld for games like zelda,1
keep in mind this was years ago nintendo has improved and updated all of the mistakes and frame rates,1
very clear and thorough thank you,2
hey just wanted to let u know what an amazing job u did explaining everything this helped me a lot,2

f for mr satoru iwata thank you may your soul rest in peace,2
this f is for respect not only to a great man but to the man who made a ton of nintendo games possible rip,2
rip mr satoru iwata for such a amazing console,2
you did a great job just got mine oled version and it was amazing f for mrsotaru iwata rest well legend,2
just got my oled model over two weeks and i personally like mines a ton been taking good care of it best gaming console ive own to date ps f for mr satoru iwata,2
ok i think there were only secrets the golf and weird home screen sounds i didnt know about and the internet thing is pretty niche but the rest of these should be known by anybody who has recently played their nintendo switch for at least hours,1
rip iwata i was so sad when he died he was the face of nintendo what a loss but his ideas gave the greatest success to the company and helped them move forward,2
dark mode was the first thing i check in the settings lol everything is dark mode for me if it is possible lol,2
rip iwata a legend never forgotten,2
rip iwata a true legend,2
still happy with my original at the minute i cant compensate paying for the upgrade personally but fully understand why you would go for it as a first time switch buyer,2
its a bit expensive and i didnt want to buy it as i have the original but my husband bought it for me as an early christmas present and i was able to transfer and re download my stuff overall im really happy with the oled version it feels more sturdy and the graphics are much better i was able to sell my original switch so we got quite a bit of our money back so i say its definitely worth it,2
it looks neat the screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original switch and the switch lite i love playing the switch on table top mode with the switch pro controller it feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel,2
thank you you just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the its just a larger screen and thats it reviews that are bandwaggoning trash so thanks very much for this you brought up a few things i didnt yet know about it,2
picked up on oled and very happy with the bigger screen size paired with my hori split pro joycons its feels greatthe stock joycons feel small and uncomfy the screen for my old switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel if you have no fingernails the cart door is way harder to open than the old switch door,2
is it just me or was the original switch more creaky when holding it than the oled the oled seems incredibly solid not sure if it just loosens overtime,1
i have the v but i do think the oled is nice i like how it has ethernet supportand i hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well i play only on my tv so i won t be upgrading until a whole new system drops but i give the oled a def worth it for new switch buyers imo,2
the card slot is way harder to open on the oled sucks for people like me with short fingernails never had this issue with the original so its baffling as to why they changed it,0
love my oled such a premium experience compared to the original,2
if nintendo makes another switch i really hope they make the joycons bigger and more ergonomic,2
i think the freechoice gym makes sense because in the pokemon world there are trainers who start their journey from towns or cities more advanced than the first village of the main character imagine if every npc started from pallet town that wouldnt make much sense right,1
these presents are really what all people need and love thank you so much,2
my man toby fox did the unimaginable yet again i cant believe he made the music for the raid battle lets gooo,2
some cool improvements here though i still think the gem forms are a little silly would love to just get mega evolution back those were awesome,2
this game seems to have a lot going for it three storylines sounds like great idea at least on paper as it would give both fans that want a more traditional pokemon game and those who want something fresh,2
onix better be in scarletviolet the dream of having a crystal onix must come true,2
i feel like the hill to climb after arceus is huge i really liked the independence aspect of the game the catching mechanics that didnt require you to battle and no forced encounter in tall grass which allowed you to see the wild pok mon these new games seem to have kept some of these so im eager to find out how it will pan out,2
legendary pokemon are elusive to find and even more difficult to catch usually only obtainable after finishing the main game nonstop rumours about dubious methods for how to obtain them underneath trucks etc vvvvrrroooommmmm,0
the new terastal gimmick looks awesome,2
i m just happy that gogoat is finally in another game such an under appreciated pok mon,2
lets not deny this guys despite the wii u being a huge commercial failure it had a great library of games its a huge shame the console itself didnt do very well,0
despite its terrible sales the wii u made up a huge part of my childhood and i loved it,2
brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now i remember when i was very little i had the n where i first played mariokart then i was later given as a present the game boy and then i remember later on i wanted the gamecube which i got i think either for my birthday or for christmas and that s where i first played animal crossing i played the other versions on the other systems as well i then asked about a year or two later santa for a blue ds lite and a few years later i got the ds i xl which was a surprise present from my grandma and when i graduated from middle school my grandma got me the wii as a graduation present i eventually also got the ds only because it was slightly cheaper and now i have the nintendo switch i still love them all and nintendo to this day animal crossing super mario bros mariokart mario party and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day and i can t wait to see super nintendo world when it opens at universal studios,2
thank you nintendo for making our childhood memorable i once owned gb color and nintendo ds and i had so much fun back in those days,2
thank you for this video now whenever nintendo talks about how much of a family friendly company they are similar to what sakurai said when he was introducing terry bogard for smash im going to remind them that they once were a love hotel,2
glad nintendo is still fighting in the console bussiness despite their ups and downs over the years the gaming world is benefited so much with nintendo in than without,2
this is probably my favorite game company thank you for making this,2
considering the games releasing for other major consoles its amazing how nintento still holding its possition as one of the big,2
what does take time to appreciate how much nintendo put into the conslas and still makes it family friendly,2
fun factthe success of nintendo switch can be attributed to several factors that have come together in favor of the console its hybrid capabilities allow it to appeal to a wide customer base and it receives plenty of support from both first party and third party developers,2
loved the first two and looking forward to the third a nice alternative to the fps shooters out there,2
funny seeing them shooting ink at the metal part of one of the salmonid bosses that boss takes no dmg when hit on its metal parts only its tail can receive damage,1
just have to say this is the best primer i ve seen for this game fantastic coverage tom,2
i love the idea of just shooting paint in the scenery that alone was enough for me to love the franchise im glad we already have a third game,2
it looks really good imo thats what i love about nintendo its always colourful and incredibly fun to play sometimes thats all you need colours in your life,2
i recommend using gyroscope it is the best option to take advantage in this game,2
i m looking forward to this one thanks for your analysis though admittedly i don t get too tripped up by graphics and performance unless it s abysmal,2
splatoon is a lot of fun to jump in and play some games will be the first i play from its release excited,2
definitely excited for this all the specs aside it s gonna be a lot of fun,2
i seem to recall splatoon being a dynamic p so it s nice to see they were able to optimize the game enough to finally make it up to p,2
the oled screen is so incredible compared to the original my flatmate bought one and i can t look at it without sheer envy,2
watching an adult get so excited about video games is my favorite thing ever literally can t stop smiling thank you for that,2
the screen is noticeably better so it definitely improves the on the go experience,2
haven t watched this channel in a while and it s honestly refreshing to see this level of excitement on youtube makes me feel giddy which i haven t felt in over years,2
managed to create a better demoreview than even nintendo could hope to do with the commercials incredible,2
the oled model definitely looks cool id love to try it out one day,2
the oled screen is truly amazing and the games look way more detailed,2
i was curious as to when youd be able to do this unboxing we all knew you were getting one but never knew when youd reveal it well worth the wait,2
watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games and after watching animal crossing and pok mon streams i kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability now i think i definitely should save up for this one i like bigger screen option and newer version can t wait to see it available on local stores as i just discovered i could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iphone also i see this as good option when you don t have smart tv to play games on like my friends and i even looked up possible laptop connections so this one looks right up to my alley also for when i m willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games which is something i ve only been discovering few weeks ago,2
i actually love every single video that you do i love seeing the joy and legit happiness that you show,2
two broken nintendo switches in one video that has to be a record whats the weirdest amazon product youve ever found use my code beatemups and link to get off save up to your own authentic japanese subscription box from bokksu dont miss out on this amazing snackjourney through japan sponsored by bokksu,2
life pro tip you dont need to use your expensive console to test if something is waterproof just use paper or something,1
i believe the general majority of the case is waterproof in sense that rain won t get in if it lands on it or it gets splashed but the zipper area is definitely not waterproof it will not make it through submersion aside from that i think it simply looked simplistic and rather stylish,1
im not gonna lie the part where you just documented your experiences with real people fixing the joycon is so refreshing and i loved this part of the video please take us shopping or something lol i know were like in a pandemic but if theres an opportunity to do it safely please take it,2
i love how friendly and cheerful was that retro employee haha,2
i just love how unexpected everything is going better than any netflix series,2
a soon as he said the word waterproof i was like here we go boys,1
the screw up was turning it on without making sure it was dry theres a possibility it wouldve worked fine,1
retro madness doesnt have much in terms of games but i will definitely keep an eye on them its easy to get retro games here in japan but obviously theyre in japanese ive noticed how hard it it to find a used game store like this on the states so this is a great find especially since they sell online thank you,2
finding controllers dead randomly happens to me to those batter packs would actually be pretty nice especially if they re reminiscent of wii motes,2
subscribe and i might give you custom switches phones ipads cars or even a house like this video if you enjoyed it i will be bringing on more subscribers to compete in challenges and win free custom items we also helped a lot of people with medical bills because this is a video where we wanted to do a lot of nice stuff for childrens hospitals and people struggling to pay medical bills thank you for all the support love you all,2
yo i remember when we did that with ipads last year that was such a fun challenge,2
i love the end where he pays the mom a lot if money she looked so happy,2
i love how he gives away money and customized electronics to people in need and i fully support that,2
this man inspired me to work hard on art and i achieved it,2
bingewatching here you guys are amaaaaziiing,2
your videos are amazing my man,2
it s so kind of him he does what he enjoys but he also give them away thank you zach,2
your just awesome theres just no other way to describe youyour truly amazing keep up the good work,2
i just realized that in every video when zhc works by himself he wins all the time,2
just because it was designed in tokyo doesn t mean it has to drift,1
you know when i was a kid i used to think you were cool despite not being a nintendo dev myself that line still cut deep,1
when i was a kid i used to think you were cool when he was a kid you could bludgeon people to death with each individual peice of first party hardware and itd still work fucking flawlessly consoles handhelds controllers carts that shit was made of nokium it did not break the number of times i threw a controller playstation you could only throw that once they were always the most sensitive xbox until the xbox one you could abuse that shit for five ten years and still see it work when you werent seeing red rings nintendo literally murder people with their gear it did not give a fuck,0
apparently its because theyre cheaply made the parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile and the buttons are suboptimal shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements theres also an issue with wiring as the button and the r button are wired together while the opposite joycon is wired regularly in other words the joycons while the optimal method to play the switch in its entirety are poorly designed for their tasks,0
iwata and reggie were the souls of nintendo they embodied why every nintendo fan loved nintendo myself included every other gaming platform at the time just felt like they were shoving shit down your throat but when nintendo was showing off stuff it was like they were popping into your living room to show you the stuff they ve been working on and were so proud of it but when they left all that soul of the company left with them i ll always be a nintendo fan but that doesn t mean they re at the best were i think they can be,2
remember if nintendo takes this down then its canon,1
you know when i was a kid i used to think you were cool this applies to so many companies and people who turned out to be terrible i ve honestly lost count,0
its not a mistake its a feature nintendo haters how are you supposed to play mario kart without drift,1
friendly reminder that the underpayed and overworked customer support nintendo staff is not in fact the one that is in charge of the design of the joy cons nor the culprit of nintendos greedy practice be civil demand your rights but respect the poor human at the other side of the phone,0
from my experience my drifting issues have largely been caused by dust blowing into the stick with compressed air or using alcohol to clean them appears to do a pretty decent job at fixing the issue still bullshit that we have to deal with this though and not everyone is as lucky as i am and may need to get their stick repaired,0
i think without e it threw off everything for nintendo that s the place for their biggest presentations and since it didn t happen this year nintendo just decided to quietly chug along until they were ready to share more as things come,1
those splatoon joycons are nice,2
im finally going to try splatoon since theres a free trial and looking forward to harvestella there are so many games i want coming out in september too im looking forward to ooblets disney dreamlight valley lemoncake wyldeflowers potion permit and hokko life so far,2
hopefully we get something for botw probably more of mxr maybe a small bit for sv finally some good news to make the week better,2
dang i just want a normal direct even tho im excited about this i want a normal direct,2
another botw trailer would be great that or wind waker and twilight princess for switch announcement,2
i m really excited for the september direct,2
hey ive been a really big fan of your channel for a long time now keep up the great work but if possible and not to cause too much of an inconvenience would it be cool if you added cst timezones as well i know i could just convert the times online but i would feel a lot better and more confident about the absolute schedule if you were the one who also inputted a central timezone schedule again im not trying to cause any inconvenience only if youre cool with it thanks i really love your content definitely one of the best nintendo intel providers i can rely on and watch almost daily,2
i want a new mainline super mario game also they need revive franchises like fzero and starfox,2
zack finally has some good news,2
pokemon legends arceus super mario d world bowsers fury super smash bros ultimate mario kart deluxe metroid dread kirby and the forgotten land xenoblade chronicles definitive edition luigis mansion super mario odyssey the legend of zelda breath of the wild honorable mention splatoon honorable mention xenoblade chronicles honorable mention animal crossing new horizons honorable mention super mario maker honorable mention pikmin deluxe,1
tbh i believe mariorabbids belonged in that list it had a great villain and a great problem creator it also had great battle actions and cutscenes i also love the fact that the villains of the game were mixed together with something to make them who they are,2
i got my first switch a month ago the oled edition and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever i started with the playstation then the gamecube gameboy advanced sp wii xbox ds xl then really got into pc games and then stopped playing videogames for many years so it was a delight getting the switch specially because of the great games it has my favorite so far have been fire emblem three houses animal crossing new horizons and smash ultimate also really surprised with mario kart its a lot of casual fun well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol great video btw,2
years later the switch library is amazing and i have most of these games what a nice list of games great video editing as well luigis mansions animationsgraphics are top tier pikmin deluxe is amazing on that as well and hope more people pick it up waiting on pikmin you have a new subscriber,2
xenoblade needs the first spot imo such a beautiful and amazing game that actually manage to perfect a system that was already in place,2
definitely dragon dogma for the best most complex combat system and great character development so many factors come into play npc companions learn player behavior improve can be borrowed from other players and then come back with gifts and trophies and new knowledge class change at any time a game that went down with the release of skyrim but remains one of the best fantasy rpgs to this day the sequel arisen finally brought a few more fast travel crystals into play,2
im not a big mario fan but paper mario on switch is really really good picnic road and so many other soundtracks are sooooo good amazing game play too clean,2
thank you for explaining that turf war is the casual mode in splatoon it seems silly but so many people judge the entire game on that mode alone,1
as a oled switch owner i have to say that it s a great list but i d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market the local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty,0
as a person who lived through the dark ages of the wii u im so glad nintendo is back making so cool games for us since the switch released,2
this looks a lot better than the version they showed last year smooth framerate fastpaced action and over the top silliness welcome back bayonetta,2
i m hoping jeanne plays more of a role in this game it s going to be the first time that she ll be active throughout the story without being mind controlled she really only appeared in the prologue and epilogue last time,2
bayonetta deserves even more shine she may not be trending but this third installment will not disappoint,2
the fact that sigurd mentions a way to an alphaverse with alpha usually meaning first kinda reinforces the idea that we re in the universe where cereza wasn t sealed away and the climax of the story could probably involve our main bayonetta because it s confirmed we re gonna meet other bayonettas this also kinda ties into how hellena taylor tweeted about getting used to not hearing her iconic voice which could mean the kinda low and seductive one she uses for our main bayo,1
guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves imagine jeanne i can t wait to see the difference hoping that jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor also i m really loving the new bg music in the first scene it s such a bayonetta genre of music,2
the music the story the characters the boss fights in the future i m getting hyped for this game owo,2
looks so good that game clearly looks like platinum was given all the time in the world to make the game as best as they can on the switch can t praise nintendo enough for keeping this franchise alive,2
nothing beats the hype of a good stylish action game and this looks like a damn good follow up to two of the best,2
bayonetta is gorgeous and her style with lady butterfly and her armor is too dopehope that the combat gets some more content besides the trailerim thinking that some nuances and combat systems will show up ingame wellgotta rack up some cash to get this one day one,2
at first i wasn t convinced with the aesthetics of this game but the more i see this trailer the smoother it actually looks and the graphics does not seem bad at all,2
i think im the best singer on youtube cant lie,2
downloading the dlc from nso feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it plus dlc on nso is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered my take,0
idk man i think it s smart to tell some parents who are not gamers how to download dlc because it allows them to give more exposure to their subscription which i argue is a great value to those interested in the content it provides,2
i was recently thinking about what would be next for nsoep and i thought it would be a great idea if gameboy and gameboy colour get launched on the standard tier in september whilst adding gameboy advance and nintendo gamecube to the expansion pack tier in october one year after the expansion pack tier had launched i also think that your idea of super mario odyssey dlc being added would be brilliant,2
it was about downloading the dlc included with the nso expansion which is done differently than other dlc and im pretty sure it came out to coincide with the new pack of tracks with mk deluxe,1
the problem is its not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the mario kart tracks for example they need to upgrade their ux and put it in the switch online section of the os and also message it better my guess when i saw this was that they can see loads of people arent taking advantage of downloading dlc as part of their sub,0
about the download dlc video i think it s more to explain how to download the dlc for free when you re a nso member because i believe many people would think that you d buy dlc in the eshop but there s an option on the dlc page to download for free so the video is warranted although it should ve been published last year when nso launched,1
after going through and seeing the user interface the download button is not as prominent as the proceed to purchase button is obvious i can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated i have some experience with uxui design so that stands out,0
wave race being here is pretty damn hype hoping we get dk and uh maybe goldeneye soon,2
virtual boy games for nintendo labo would be nice as well as optional colour pallete swaps so you can either play in authentic red scale or have it recoloured to include all colours of the rainbow,2
a m me gusta que sea de pago ya que eso genera que no haya microtransacciones pero lo que me molesta es pagar para jugar online despu s de comprar el juego,1
splatoon es una experiencia que ning n otro shoter puede ofrecerte aunque todo lo de nintendo evidentemente cuesta dinero,2
creo que uno de los fallos al ser gratuito como fortnite o fall guys es que debe ser multiconsola y permit interacci n online entre ellas cosa que splatton solo es de nintendo en lo personal me molesta el modo micropagos para cuestiones cosm ticas pero m s cuando las mejoras de equipo si cuestan porque lo vuelve un ptw creo que es mejor pagar por un juego completo que sea gratis y las recompensas sean una baba que no sirve de nada,1
nunca he jugado splatoon probar la versi n de prueba en unos d as y ver si me lo compro o no tiene buena pinta,1
yo opin que el juego es perfecto as lo nico que ser a genial es jugarlo sin online ya que much simas personas no tienen para el servicio,1
a mi me hubiese gustado mucho que le hubiese a adido un modo cpu al igual que lo tiene los mario karts o super smash bros como opci n para los que no pueden permitirse pagar el online y caso cerrado,1
este ser mi primer splatoon si lo compro de otra regi n para ahorrar dinero a n podr usar el online de m xico de forma correcta o tendr problemas,1
no s qu tan desacuerdo estar a conque sea gratis personalmente prefiero pasar por caja una sola vez y tener pr cticamente todo lo disponible,1
si el juego se enfoca en multijugador si deber a de ser gratis esto mismo paso con halo infinite que el multijugador es gratis para todos hasta en pc adem s al ser gratis impulsar a la compra de membres as online de nintendo b,1
no creo que deba ser gratuito por qu si es as le pasar a lo mismo que al tf,1
dejad un rt para apoyarnos no te pierdas la futrue game show,1
yo estaba viendo cada vez m s factible que el nintendo direct fuese el d a me mont la pel cula de que nintendo quer a hacer eventos o dar noticias cada semana desde el partner showcase hasta el direct de septiembre y ten a la sensaci n de que el treehouse era como su timo recurso para cumplir dicho objetivo aunque a saber incluso siendo la semana del puede que sea cierto y estas semanas las completen con treehouses de otros juegos como mario rabbids o sonic frontiers por cierto se agradece mucho que tambi n deis noticias peque as como la del canal de sakurai,1
tambi n el d a en la tokyo game show capcom que ya ha confirmado su participaci n tanto presencial como online retransmitir ese mismo d a a las h cest un programa online centr ndose en t tulos de la propia capcomcomo monster hunterhablar n de la actualizaci n gratuita de mh sunbreak fechada para finales de septiembre y megaman y luego el d a a las h cest retransmitir un programa especial dedicado a street fighter,1
tengo entendido que lo que ya no se podra es a adir fondos de ninguna manera pero si se podra seguir comprando si tienes unificados los saldos de ds y switch se podra comprar por sea caso,1
tengo miedo de que tampoco haya direct en septiembre,1
ojal salga un starfox muchas ganas de que hagan un juego potente franquicia bastante desperdiciada,1
siiiii si el direct es el ser en mi cumple tremendo regalo jajaja ojal espero que haya algo de starfox,1
nintendo ha anunciado la fecha en la que cerrar n las tiendas digitales de wii u y nintendo ds ser el pr ximo de marzo de y ya no se podr comprar nada aunque si tienes el juego podr s seguir descarg ndolo recibiendo actualizaciones de software y jugando online,1
no van a cerrar las eshops hasta marzo solo no se podr meter dinero pero si tienes vinculada la eshop de switch no hay problema,1
lo de pok mon si somos optimistas puede ser bueno si se tardan a o en hacer un juego y lo acaban antes podr an tener m s tiempo para pulirlo con fe,1
ehh this line was pretty dumb the game engine unity has nothing to do with how the game feels when controlling my apologies for this one,0
be warned guys this is scotts last ever nintendo switch five years in video so savour it,1
this isnt the nintendo i grew up loving yeah because you werent paying attention back then easily your most cutting line to date,0
i really respect how scott is a big nintendo fan but isnt fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgias sake so many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent nintendos way being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be,0
this video has the scott the woz feel all over it it is definitely a video is it sure has been five years in,2
it s been over a year and i still see mario d all stars on store shelves,1
the fact that balan wonderworld and breath of the wild came out years apart and both cost makes me unbelievably sad,0
i m going to be legit sad when the switch era ends this is the last nintendo console that came out before i graduated i m having less and less time to play games but the few hours i put at them bring me tons of joy i hope i can have time for the switch,2
i m seriously impressed how scott can talk for over hours and still keep it interesting even if i can t watch it in go i still come back to watch the whole thing,2
this was a joy to watch i really like this series just wrapping up a whole year in sections is a great way to look back this year felt pretty monotone for me i wasnt over hyped for anything and as a pokemon fan pla was cool but bdsp felt janky kirby was incredible kingdom hearts being cloud versions was the biggest let down for me though,2
cant wait cool to see some prolonged gameplay,2
something i noticed that is so small but such a good detail is instead of abruptly stopping they gradually skid to a stop amazing detail,2
is it just me or does it look like everyone will be able to dodge roll now and not just duelie mains i think splatoon three is gonna be easy to pick up but hard to master nothing wrong with that though cant wait to meet everybody in the turf war,2
new inkzoka looks cool looks very strong and the shot limit really helps balance it out a bit my question however is if the rainmaker will take on this kind of triple spiral shot that the inkzoka has as the rainmaker always takes after the cannon like special in each game would make for interesting ranked matches,2
the specials are looking more aggressive than splatoon s while not being totally op like splatoon s were eeltail alleys looking quite welldesigned for something so basic and open the stringers looking like it could be more flexible than the old chargers but it might not have charge storage when morphed and im calling it the vacuum specials going to be called the sucker shot well that was a disappointment and after theyd done so well with other names like killer wail echolocator bubbler inkjet etc,1
i really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match not to mention the music is hard just and a half months and the wait will finally be over,2
what i have gleamed from this is that ill definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment the specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes i love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered it gives people a chance who normally wouldnt be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them i personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to longranged weapons when your weapon doesnt have the kit to contend definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you,2
i can t even this game is going to be so good the added player titles the new music absolutely slaps and the new victory animations and just everything else,2
this gameplay is awesome and i am loving the music being played especially now or never it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast,2
i love the new display and gear the new abilities fit the city of chaos get up i like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials can t wait to see if they release a test fire,2
pin,1
the fact this came from kotaku means it cant be taken serious,0
soo let me get this straight a person that refuses to reveal their identity point tells a very fishy story point without any proof point for a joke that wasnt even sexual harassment point then she revealed her tragic story to kotaku point yeah no lmao i cant even take this seriously,0
calling kotaku a reliable source is like calling twitter users intelligent,1
if one guy posting memes in a group chat is the best example they can find of these years of sexual harassment at noa i think its safe to say they dont have a harassment problem,1
you don t get to say stray is a racist game and have me take you seriously one of innumerable examples if people really are doing criminalinappropriate things at work then punish them accordingly but until someone with a shred of integrity reports it i will withhold judgement,0
if she thinks a couple of inappropriate jokes over the course of years is a harrowing experience she must live a very sheltered life,0
someone making sexual jokes about fictional characters in a chat is not sexual harassment its not even directed at her she wants it to be harassment specifically because shes a woman who was part of the chat,0
oh kotaku a very very reliablecredible source of information with no activist agenda nor creating drama to mine click or dehumanizing gamers doesn t kotaku have an axe to grind with nintendo,0
taking kotaku seriously is like taking what people say on twitter seriously,1

donde anuncien un nuevo mario en d para switch exploto de la emoci n y tambi n eso dir a mucho de nintendo sobre las intenciones que tienen con switch por que un mario d usualmente sale a vender nueva consola por lo que si lanzan un nuevo juego as me har a pensar a mi que no est n pensando en lanzar una nueva consola en el futuro cercano muy curioso pero no importa por mi esta bien por que adoro el nintendo switch sobre todo con los juegazos que est n sacando ltimamente,1

im not sold on the new gimmick and frankly nothing will ever beat the sheer excitement mega evolution gave me but im really looking forward to play both of these games,2
one day one day id love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed,2
im really hoping we get to battle other regions champions in the end game and who else prefers mega evolution,2
the abundant nature screen shows player traversing blank terrain with one or two pok mon species and approaching a gas station to refuel their lizardcycle,1
we finally getting crystal onix,2
its finally heading the right way arceus was just a tester for this bigger game but they definitely need new hardware and get the graphics and framerate better for on tvs,2
for scarlet and violet coverage,1
i m sooooo excited for the abundant nature,2
when do the two legendaries fuse together to become the almighty megazord,1
time for real talk with rgt lol,1
perfectly said i ve been bringing up stuff like this for years and i absolutely despise this double standard you can love their games all you want i certainly do but nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them this needs to be fixed not just at nintendo but everywhere,0
good stuff man people being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet,2
when i was a kid in the early s you could still write a sloppy hand written page letter with crayon drawings and send it to nintendo of america and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was and complementing your crappy drawings in detail i think my dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk those days are long gone,0
you re right everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there s a lot of virtue signalling going on also while we re at it let s all admit that as much as people like to hate kotaku at least they re willing to report this kind of stuff,0
here s a hot take most hardcore gamerstech workers who would in nerd stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos this is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault andor harassment,0
no new concept was added to my life with this video maybe it will help someone out there to see companies as companies not friends,1
its good to see that youre always willing to speak your mind in a time where anybody that speaks up on anything will be bashed and harassed for being honest the direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother,2
i like nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment which happens in too many places men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others,0
congratulations rgt you re finally learning what trends are it seems nintendo hasn t trended negatively like activision has so their opinions haven t been altered,2
i miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the game s challenges,2
congratulations nintendo you did it you added what should have been there in the first place,2
thank god the queen of mario sportsparty games is finally here daisy deserves better i absolutely love her,2
daisy should have been there from the first but i am glad to see more than a single character in these updates a stage and gear its exciting but it also means my expectations were very low,2
i do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else if all the dlc adds new stages gear and characters then i ll be coming back to this game for a long time,2
it s about time daisy came to this game she should ve been here from the drop i am so hyped,2
this is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one i want to see much bigger updates in the future,2
id never argue with new content entirely so im grateful and happy theyve added what they added here i think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity it would need to have a spectator mode and possibly proper v online where all players can be remote so that there could be a tourney scene i myself would be hosting them regularly with a spectator mode client but it could go esports if they had a tournament scene like that but like i say im happy for any additional content being added to the game and i hope theyll consider modesfeatures for the updates to come,2
you guys really need to start releasing your games with full content on release,2
good to see them adding in more stadiums too not just characters,2
i dont know why but its so nice seing people get nice things for themselves,2
i think that this is the most beautiful unboxing for this nintendo that i ve ever seen,2
hey just to let u know at u go to press the power button on the switch to turn it on but u can actually hold the home button on ur joy con to turn ur switch on as well a lot easier especially if ur playing docked hope this helps,2
ngl im not into this whole aesthetics vibe but ur videos have helped me find the right accessories for my switch and have made my days more peaceful thanks peachdudu,2
oooh the case is so cute i like the peach one too hahah nice to see you uploading again since youre way more active on instagram,2
the peach joycon looks so cute,2
all the accessories look so cute,2
great video love how you style everything so cutely i really wish to get my own switch oled soon btw where did you buy this tiny white tv looking thing in the back with the pastel buttons,2
omg that s so cool congrats on the new switch this was so relaxing to watch,2
get the products here nintendo switch earbuds nintendo switch dust cover nintendo switch thumb grips,1
this is the same guy that said a screen protector is useless,0
now he s actually mentioning unessesary accessories,1
its was like i was in space so they dont work because there is no sound in space,0
i love how he says that a steering wheel for race games are unnecessary but then says that you need a sticker on the thumbstick,1
reminder this was the same guy that said that a charging portable stand is useless because the switch has a kickstand,0
a fan for your switch is useless haha heres a dust cover,0
the only thing the dust cover will do is cause your switch to overheat because the airintakeexhaust of the cooler gets covered,1
felt like i was in space in space there is no noise,2
use other headphones they work just fine,2
what do you think of all of this will it be in future games lemme know,1
id like to see a k docked and p handheld successor to the switch thats backwards compatible and more powerful with better graphics online and frame rate too,2
what i need going forward is a nintendo switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games i need to play xenoblade chronicles and torna over again in true p or at p whether it be fps or fps i just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed of course this would benefit many other games but i havent ng xc because i am hopeful ill get to reexperience improved on new hardware,2
i actually feel nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the nintendo switch level its the perfect system whether you want a home console portable or both they should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks id also like to see more things the switch could be paired with like linking to discord and spotify and having them run in the background,2
graphics do matter but its more tied to the visual style and aesthetics that are implemented i dont care about super realistic graphics i just want stable eyepleasing visuals with amazing gameplay look no further than how poorly some of the earlier realistic graphics have aged on previous consoles while games with a more unique art style have remained timeless,1
given nintendos track record with moves that make sense they will use this feature sparingly as they did with cloud gaming and file transfers,1
it must be difficult for nintendo to decide on how to move on from the switch i would like to see the next console hybrid hopefully support switch cartridges still,1
i wonder if no mans sky coming to switch in october will incorporate some of this new tech weve been seeing more of seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the switch im still really curious to see how it turns out likely will either be a pretty solid fps or fps with frame drops and low res i suspect the low rest automatically in either case but i never played the game so im interested to possibly give it a try if its a half decent port,2
i still love my switch but after owning the steam deck for a couple of weeks i have to say valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the steam deck then nintendo is the switch ive already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then nintendo has in years nintendo needs to take a page out of valves playbook here,2
i d love to see monolith apply this tech either fsr or dlss when the newer model drops in an update to xenoblade chronicles all the xenoblade games are in my evergrowing backlog so i think i ll wait to see if this actually happens,2
so should we do another one of these videos next time go to for off your order brought to you by raycon,2
this feels like a special sitcom episode when the whole cast is in another country xd love it,2
og beatemups style content with a new crowd this is great stuff wood always fun to go along on the hunt with you all,2
bob s commentary made this video feel like a mockumentary also seeing vlog style nintendo content recorded in nyc took me back to the cnd etika days man such good times,2
there s a part of me that was getting the vibe of old cnd vlogs at the beginning there just seeing the store again brought me back to good times,2
i love this new documentary style its so nice seeing everyone have fun together,2
god i want to go to the nintendo store in new york so badly it seems like it has so much cool stuff in it,2
bobs commentary makes everything better,2
omg just loved hanging out with you guys in this video it really reminded me of the time some friends and i used to go game hunting in s o paulo like about years ago thanks for bringing those sweet memories back i would definitely love more videos like this one,2
awe the japan videos are the exact time i found you while researching if i wanted to buy my wife a switch for christmas,2
is the steam deck the end of nintendo switch what are your thoughts are you buying one why or why not go to for up to off your order brought to you by raycon,1
ive had my steam deck for about a month now and your reaction to the weight was exactly the same reaction i had everyone says its so big but honestly when you hold it in your hand and feel that weight it makes everything go away amazing handheld,2
personally i d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging i appreciate a company that s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run,2
while i really have no plans to get a steam deck im hoping that a little healthy competition for the switch will make nintendo step up their game with the next switch or with some sort of pro model like the fans have been crying for for years,1
the steam deck is an excellent friendly competitor nintendos advantage is many great first ip and tons of third parties not to mention name recognition but the stream deck could make nintendo focus on creating a nintendo switch pro or nintendo switch that has more power which i think is great because it puts more pressure on nintendo to do better,2
i think fancy premium packaging would be cool but i like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses,2
the packaging feels really nice and valvelike they made it simple and homey if you get me and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant the outside doesn t matter it s the inside that matters this couldn t be more true with the steam deck,2
while the steam decks performance handling these aaa games is impressive id really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects the steam deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try pc gaming and it really has so much more to offer where i feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known smaller and past titles basically pick any random old game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rereleaseremaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console older games often look much better on smaller screens too so many should be fantastic on that little thing,2
one of my favorite uses for my steam deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console ive always wished the switch would be,2
this is the best steam deck ive watched even out of all the tech youtubers and video game channels love the up in the video production quality as well wood keep levelling up awesome content,2
did you like what xbox had to show at gamescome,1
xbox is just going strong and its becoming the most preferred platform pretty quickly,2
i m actually hyped for lies of p and it s day one on game pass man next years is going to be a crazy year for games,2
when they showed the lies of p trailer and it was coming to game pass and then it was given most anticipated playstation game i laughed so hard,2
lies of p in gamepass callisto protocol looks amazing i m really looking forward to what gamepass is bringing for the rest of the year edit atomic heart is still set to release at the end of the year another great looking gamepass game day one,2
ps fanboys game pass is full of fodder that no one wants to play also ps fanboys cant wait for life of p,0
this year looking forward to moonscars scorn high on life darktide solar ash next year and beyond lies of p silksong redfall the last case of benidict fox starfield stalker avowed atomic heart the outer worlds hellblade next es fallout and more so incredibly happy with my pc gamepass subscription so much entertainment and savings microsoft rocks,2
i doubt well get any new announcements anytime soon and i dont really care about indie games theyre all kind of the same to me they just look different most of the time and about pc feel like they should work more on xbox and not pc and i have pc but thats me,0
i just can t wait to play fable that s really the only game i m looking forward to,2
high on life is going to be my go to game the gameplay they showed i believe is the first boss battle my bet the further you get into the game the bigger the boss the bigger environment youll be fighting them in,2
let me know what you think and please consider subscribing here become a member here,1
he specified one box exclusives in the market those exclusives are necessary in order to get subscribers if all the services are the same there wont be no point in services its like with netflix and diseny exclusive content but that is allowed to come out on blue ray from disney but not on netflix same thing for services,1
i love how some people are missing the point of his statement he literally means one platform xbox been doing this for years and now even playstation is slowing doing it,1
youre constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content thank you,2
i think phil is referring to games coming to pc and mobile as for xbox games it means the same but also where ever game pass is too i seen a lot of playstation fanboys acting like xbox will go rd party and all xbox games will be on playstation,1
console exclusives arent going anywhere they would be insane to split market share off of their hardware their ecosystem and ultimately their control nintendo has dominated both sony and microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the switch they are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform,2
destin i think i enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument to the issue of exclusives i think the strategy of ms has already been spelled out what i think ms plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy they will have console exclusives but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is sonys strategy it just means they will release on multiple devices from pcs to tvs to mobile phones and through cloud ms has expanded agreesively but i personally do not think their games will go to sony consoles like most people tend to think because sony are their competition,2
i think its a time of wait and see imo were seeing all these investments because interest rates are low if at the end of the process sony for example dont see financial gain i can easily see it reverting were all hoping this works as gamers but none of us know what the end result will be,1
phil spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new hes staying consistent,2
i would love to boot up my console and swap from battlefield to halo to spiderman to mario kart to pok mon within the same ecosystem but i just dont think something like that will happen unless there is a third party neutral console that has all the subscriptions for each major player on it,1
hollow knight high on life plague tale forza flight simulator overwatch ara history untold forza ark scorn flintlock minecraft legends lightyear frontier gunfire reborn the last case of benedict fox as dusk falls naraka bladepoint pentiment from obsidian grounded from obsidian ereban shadow legacy diablo sea of thieves ravenlok cacoon wo long fallen dynasty persona royal,1
i liked how they showed gameplay for all their games they showcased gives us an idea of what to expect,2
this looks awesome im really excited for most of these games i just wish the wait time for release wasnt so long though i respect the hard work being put in to develop them,2
im so hyped for starfield but i feel like i cant be sold on it because of how this was basically what happened with fallout major hype then it releases and colossal flop i really hope bethesda can deliver this time,1
probably the biggest w ever such amazing games and very well done to xbox for doing this for us xbox better forever,2
super happy about the pretty substantial single player games coming out not into online social multiplayer games at all so this was very much welcomed,2
wow i watched summerfest and was like wtf this could of been sent out in an email this show blew it out of the water so many gampass games to actually look forward to hopefully these games actually deliver in the hype,2
this game was very beautiful in k in k we can see very details of the game i hope bethesda continues the good work until the launch of it,2
great presentation love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games very grateful for game pass love this service,2
what do you think about the future of console exclusives thanks for watching and liking the video,2
what would be the point in multiple consoles if they are all the same then we might as well have a one console nation no competition or reasons to buy different consoles exclusives give each console an identity and reasons to invest into a particular console there s a reason netflix has different movies from hbo max,1
i believe most exclusives will be timed exclusives companies like nintendo will never ever have their first party titles on other platforms,1
xbox says game pass is the future because we have it then exclusives are doomed because we have less than none,0
i disagree console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart if exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a playstation xbox or switch everyone will become a pc gamer in a perfect world sony microsoft nintendo will join forces and sony will engineer the hardware with microsoft s wallet and ambition for higher specs and nintendo s passion for innovation unfortunately we don t live in such a world,1
if all games were on one console that would eliminate competition and create a monopoly,1
considering how well nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the switch i find phils comments laughable,0
i have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives i get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform this coming phil along xboxs track record concerning their exclusives since around and up havent exactly been praised as playstations have been this is more corporate weasel words xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises halo gears of war umim sure im forgetting some others the line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption xbox has doing really well with game pass but they are missing that killer app for the system,0
ok phil is right as far a exclusives go because they are also on pc so there will be no exclusives multiple devices references pc tv phone console so no they dont need sonys console for sales,1
meanwhile nintendo hell nah not me or my son,1
pinned comment this video took a little while to put together sorry for the delay but let me know what your favorite reveal was at gamescom,1
apart from lies of p and calisto protocol i really found atlas fallen to be really interesting surprised no one is talking about this new game reveal also absolutely thrilled to learn that lies of p will release day on game pass one of the few benefits of owning both consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds,2
lies of p looks incredible also dead island looks like it could be good high on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads,2
this was a very solid gamescom especially loved the bit of trolling we got from kojima seems like this event just keeps getting better every year,2
favorite reveal was gameplay of lies of p coming to gamepass day yes looks and feels like its gonna be awesome definitely playing it but yea is stacked,2
i knew something was missing out of my daily life thanks for the vids jay your work and content is so underrated,2
atlas fallen the lords of the fallen and lies of p were my favorite take aways from the show well where winds meet too but im hesitant since i dont know if it will release on xbox or not,1
high on life is conker but as a first person shooter im hyped for that game lies of p is the successor of bloodborne callisto protocol looking good sonic frontiers im impressed atlas fallen and dead island oh yea,2
pretty good show overall can t wait for lies of p man,2
i agree that the show was average but the dead island reveal made my day dead island and dead island riptide are the most addictive zombie games i have played i played both of them all the way to the end,2
thanks for watching what consoles do you currently own,2
just bought the series s it looks great loads fast and plays next gen games ill upgrade in a couple years when the series x is easier to find its worth it people,2
series s is perfect for playstation players who want to expand their gaming library after getting my ps i wanted a cheap way into the xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that i honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps due to the small size and price,2
the deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when ive amassed a huge collection of physical discs thats why i got the series x however for anyone new to xbox or someone who doesnt own physical discs this is a great purchase,2
ive owned both and the series s has a special place in my heart i love the x but unless youre rocking a tv that supports k w vrr the series s is just fine also its so tiny and its amazing what a quiet beast it is but definitely buy the storage expansion card regardless of which one you buy,2
the series s is plain amazing especially with gamepass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming ive just completed the entire gears series on because i never got to play them back in the day gears to judgment and its been a pure blast you can also find an online list of all the games who received an fps boost including xbox and xbox games so theres that too some are now locked at and some are even at fps yes my last name is spencer how did you know,2
the only next gen console i could find was this one have owned it for about a year regrets would buy it again its amazing its form factor blows my mind so tiny but so powerful,2
i definitely have no complaints with the series s from what ive seen is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console,2
i was totally blown away by my series s i still can t believe what you can get there for bucks still i upgraded to series x because i m used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money still i would totally go for the series s it s super quiet performance is mind blowing and it s pretty small i guess this time xbox is superior to playstation even though everybody is freaking out about ps and is probably sleeping on the new xbox consoles though they re way better x is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer i didn t expect to be that happy with xbox after being used to a high end pc,2
needless to say that the series s is actually easy to find and purchase while getting a series x for not more than original retail price is difficult,2
xbox just announced the xbox series s as a suprise so unfortunately its missing in this video the price is also announced for the xbox series x and for the xbox series s what do you think will you buy the series x or s,1
i love your content animation is smooth audio isn t weird and bad and the information is so interesting to watch,2
so much nostalgia i remember every weekend getting out of school going to my friends house and playing halo for hours on the original xbox the good ol days man,2
intro before the xbox plans to make the xbox fun fact xbox xbox xbox elite xbox s xbox e red ring of death xbox kinect add on xbox one xbox one s xbox one x xbox one s all digital xbox series x,1
seeing the halo game clips brought tears to my eye i remember first playing it on the original xbox and wow best way to introduce me into a game franchise i love being born in the s,2
when the first xbox came out it had some awesome games on it a decent amount of games as it evolved games started fading for the system it gained way more power etc each time but lacked games with each update lol now we have the ultimate series x microsoft figured since there s no games for the system for real they gave it the ability to play pc games as well,2
in a few years when you have millions of subs ill be glad to call myself an og,2
really well made video packed with useful information and great editing keep it up,2
when this man hits millions i ll be happy that i was a part with him through out his journey,2
ive been xbox ever since the first one and i own all generations of the consoles and in my opinion the was the best one for user interaction as it was simple enough yet an excellent experience,2
sign up for whatnot and follow me so you dont miss the auction giveaway live auction will be august at am pst be sure youre following me as only those following me will be eligible for the giveaway,1
if i were the viewer who sold this to you i would be crying right now as a hobby repairman it surprises me how many times i buy something broken and its just dirty or unplugged baffling really,0
man that dude got scammed such a simple fix how do repair shops like that even exist,0
ahh yes the repair equivalent of making sure the device is plugged in i bet you enjoy these once in a while,2
nice job steve love an easy one every once in a while,2
great content as always teaching a younger generation all about right to fix,2
honestly i think having the perfect amount of thermal paste is what did it,2
great job steve we all need easy fixes hahahaha good luck to whoever wins,2
i bought a used star wars xbox and the controller they set me had a problem with the left bumper i was inspired by you so i got a screwdriver opened it up and managed to fix it thanks for making the videos and inspiring others,2
working on railways messing around with circuits for a living i hate troubleshooting when its something simple weve just overlooked last fault i had that i was there for fixing was literally a diode being the wrong way round cost fuse hand tracing and belling all the connection points before finally we found the diode was the wrong way round hours later its always the last thing you check love seeing this kind of content when its an easy fix,0
which nextgen console do you prefer,1
im more of an xbox person but i still respect playstation,2
if i didnt have a pc i would have gone for the xbox series x,1
for my personal budget i grabbed an xbox series x primarily because of game pass which has been an amazing experience hopefully after tax season i ll be able to find a ps the sony exclusives are the one thing that i m missing on my xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol i think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it s gamers paradise,2
i m a fan of gaming not a fan of a specific company i enjoy both systems,2
my st console was the original ps loved it so much that i stayed with them and upgraded to ps somewhere in there i picked up a used xbox because my st lan party with halo just blew me away then rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what i was willing to spend at that time so i turned to nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems getting the xbox series x was an easy decision for me i have nintendo switch for my exclusives strategy and rpg needs while the xbox satisfied my craving for fps and games that required higher processing and graphical power,2
honestly for most people it comes to whatever your friends have,1
i like them both like they both have great exclusives and great hardware and stunning traffics where it is hard to tell the difference between reality and non reality they both are amazing systems,2
you quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play that is a win for the xbox because it has direct integration with pc you can chat with anyone on pc but also directly play with them in a slew of gamepass games that silently support crossplay between pc and xbox playstation is doubling down on the walledgarden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization perpetuating the console wars really no brainer microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience including online,2
you are absolutely brilliant at reviewing stuff clear and concise,2
this looks really fresh definitely gonna check this out in release,2
this looks absolutely ridiculous im all for it,0
theme art combat everything looks so well crafted wish the story too holds up to make it an awesome game,2
this game looks very promising theres not many dark souls clones that actually succeed but this has potential,2
looks insane big win for gamepass,2
this seems too good to be true beautiful and very unique aesthetics with souls combat mechanics fingers crossed for this one,2
another elseworld style videogame im excited to see what they will do,2
so far the coolest thing i think ive seen in gamescom this year,2
that end seems like they know exactly what s going on with the fromsoft crowd that s art,1
absolutely cannot wait to play this day one on game pass man this looks amazing,2
i was once in line at a gamestop to buy a used ps when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his ps so i bought the ps off the guy for less then what gamestop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store we both won on that day,2
as someone i used to work for gamestop my advice is to always buy the used system over the refurbished ones the refurbished ones were broken at one point and whoever fixes them doesnt do a great job,0
i was a manager at electronics boutique years ago and we had the same problem with the ps company refurbs and they usually didn t operate i told my staff to unpack them when they came in immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out we had gotten burned too many times and i wasn t gonna put my customers through that anymore,0
i sold my xbox one x a few months ago on ebay and whew this video makes it seem like i really sold mine for far far too cheap im one of those people that keeps everything including the foam wrap plastic bags and twist ties so the console looks pretty darn good once i get it all back together i can imagine that the only reason youd want to buy from gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong and familiarity also they dont know me but they know gamestop,2
i worked at gamestop for years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs i ve seen the first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in it s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out i bet it s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it s been resurfaced in some way the second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under minutes with these consoles very little is done before they re repackaged and sold,0
something to keep in mind i had to replace the thermal past and pads because the home screens of most games were enough to make it over heat and power off,1
i used to work in a used game store we would refurbish gamestop refurbished consoles literally daily from people who had them for just a little over a month gamestop refurbishes are known for taking shortcuts at every possible turn and using the cheapest replacement parts available we had a local gamestop that was notorious for ignoring thermal paste on literally everything they did so much so we put out a social media post letting everyone in our area know we would redo the thermal paste in any gamestop console they purchased within a week with proof for fuck gamestop,1
i used to work at gamestop and i can say they didnt give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders,0
i work at gamestop and we arent supposed to package it like that the price is high cause we are low supply of consoles but everything else is pretty accurate ahaha,1
fyi for those of us who miss out on a sale by a few daysif an item goes on sale a few days after you bought it just call up customer service and politely ask for a partial refund gamestop is usually pretty good about giving you the difference in cost between what you paid and the current price of the console,1
i hope there will be more games hitting fps at at least p if not with the series x then definately release a pro midgen refresh asap,2
i would love to see a series x pro version with a bit more power to run flight simulator properly especially with so many addons that tax the system and a increase in fps for flight sim would be great,2
i think a pro series x with wifi and more powerful chip would be nice they could keep the same ssd,2
a pro version of the xbox and playstation is something that isnt needed they are still making cross generation games leading into the end of and possibly if there is going to be a refresh it may not be until or,1
i think game pass will have million subscribers at the end of next year all the game releases and activisionblizzard games in game pass will surely add alot to it,2
its nice to see a channel dedicated to xbox so many other channels are all about the switch or ps and ive always been a huge xbox fan and i love my series x,2
the medium ground of these two consoles would probably be a xbox series x sized console or thinner but slightly more powerful than the series x is,2
im a huge playstation fan picked up the ps day i just picked up a series x a few days ago and i gotta say im pretty damn impressed get both if you can,2
might be longer for a ps or a xbox series y considering the economical structure has crumbled over the years and technology has peaked for large leaps we just need better games better game optimization and better engines for games,1
i am all for a series s plus having a disc drive and more storrage must buy,2
i subscribed,1
was very interested in redfall when announced loving the new details and thought put into the game a day one for me even if on gamepass,2
gamepass is such an amazing servicei mean at first it was ok but now and next year wowcan t wait for all these games to release day one,2
the reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger none of their past games have had an open world their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations in this game its actually one open world so its the largest open space of any game they created and they did say that this open world is bigger than prey,1
there is no loop hole for how death stranding made it to game pass pc as some have already commented owns the pc rights so theyre free to put it on anything they want sony owns the console rights to ds so this is why it will probably never come to xbox consoles unfortunately,0
redfall is going to be sick,2
hell yeah cant wait for gamescom,2
game pass has been a great service for me i love all the games that come day one that save me so much money by not having to even buy them it s great,2
i play on pc ive been a console gamer forever since but i built a pc recently with an k and a ti i play my xbox on pc i call it my series pc redfall is looking awesome,2
dang they are sweating the details that looks fun and the fact you can solo play awesome,2
even though i dont have children or any family members who have an xbox series s or x i think the family plan is a great deal i am cool with paying the a month for just myself though,2
this is awesome i can t believe they re doing it as they have no real monetary reason to do it other than consumer good grace,2
personally im stoked for the family plan,2
that makes sense that they are going into the holiday season that they want to maximize any sales for that so that is really only going to be like months only,1
would be nice if the family plan had different levels that we could pay for so we can pay for how many people we want to share with in our family so if i only have person i want to share with then it should be cheaper than a family plan that allows people to sharethis would be great imo,2
this is such a great feature,2
series s game pass is the most fun ive had with gaming in many years,2
if only microsoft has a phone plan for all carriers honestly i saw it was for verizon but i want it for boost mobile so u could pay your phone plan and including the plan with a monthly xbox live service so every month u could just plan your phone bill and be able to play on xbox,2
i want my xbox s to be a always online server for gaming and with the new deal with unity maybe some game dev oooooo,2
well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they aint planning any new additions this yr we should be good honestly its not a big deal for me personally i run both xbox series s and x which honestly its been more series s than the x and ps so im good on games lol dude i have thousands of games already on both platforms so yea and atm im back on forza horizon and and elden ring and dark souls and demon souls remake so ill be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on gp im ok and im sure many of us are xbox has been really good to us ya know they take a huge hit just for us to have fun and thats why i love xbox they truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series s and x and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it yeah games on xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps n ps ect but still they do good by us with game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series s n x and i dont understand why ppl are shit talking the series s dude i love mine i have of em and it can do k microsoft already said it does lmao and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your tv go to settings display settings and select k hz or k hz what ever your tv or monitor does and then start a game and then take the tv remote and hit the ok button your tv will tell you what the series s is putting out to it mine shows k hz hdr dd and the games look beautiful and smooth yeah its not as nice as the series x but its def not p its a higher resolution and i dont see how someone can get p by looking at it lol p dont look that damn sharp n good lmao and just look at the ps pro specs the ps pro is a k correct well the series s has better specs has better hardware the same or a lil more tflops as well the series is is a zen which is a amd k series a rtx machine it will do k just not as well as its bigger brother the x,2
who else remembers the good ol days when was popular,1
i miss this i used to play a lot of halo with my brothers i was or back then and never realized just how good i had it this sound kinda just sums up my amazing childhood and the golden age of gaming that just isn t the same nowadays,2
this this is it this gave me so many memories,2
the good ol memories of the og xbox and startup ahh good times,2
the original xbox was my first one got it in though because i havent heard of it until the fall of from my uncle besides halo now here i am at still loving it,2
one of the best sounds to hear as a kid,2
that og startup was sooo fresh as a kid,2
i was years old and would spend hours watching my brothers play skyrim cod black ops multiplayerzombies prince of persia minecraft batman dead space black ops holds a very special place in my heart even tho i never really got to play those games just watching my brothers play em was fun enough for me i would do anything to go back to those days to get excited whenever i heard the xbox start up sound even tho i couldnt play games till i was older just watching my brothers gaming adventures and playing online with my other brothers that was fun enough for me brings back alot of nostalgic memories,2
the nostalgia from this sound alone makes me want to cry,2
i still own my xbox because there are games i still enjoyed playing from them the startup still sounds breathtaking,2
these are so helpful i wouldnt know about more than half this stuff if it wasnt for these weekly updates,2
cooking sim was bugged to hell for me two point campus was quite fun,2
if i could only play oneid pick moonscars,2
please ad cult of the lamb to game pass,1
very excited for train sim world already pre ordered,2
i wanna play cult of the lamb so much,2
cult of the lamb great indie roguelike game,2
man its been pretty slow these past few weeks hopefully well be back on track next week when game pass stuff gets updates as well as pacman and ninja turtles collection,1
me mastering that cooking game in hours also me still sucking to cook in real life,0
we want the quarry in game pass please,1
what a beautiful disco mansion i am envious of your takeout boxes and other lovely junk and that shoutout really caught me off guard thank you,2
the amount of innovation that goes into using all these random scraps and pieces and bringing them together into one beautiful piece of artwork is just mind blowing,2
your ingenuity and resourcefulness driven by your creativity is every bit as impressive as the video content and video quality im glad i found your channel this was super fun you put the same effort and creativity into the video as you do the project no wonder you have over one and a half million subs seriously you should be super proud awesome job friend thanks so much for the content,2
dude the editing and footage variety is top notch really enjoyed watching this very very good and of course awesome build crazy,2
youve really come along ways over the years love the editing style and the projects,2
thrift shop cashier what are you doing with all this random unrelated junk martina my goals are beyond your understanding,0
this looks amazing and watching you construct the whole thing was really cool makes me wish i had a custom housing for my ps awesome work keep it up,2
i ve seen some mad stuff in my time but you literally took the saying persons junk is another ones treasure and turned it into something awesome video presentation is engaging and fun i really enjoyed that video,2
martina you are so inspiring and i love the way you are doing this stuff with so much fun,2
insanely cool using old rubbish and second hand items is also very admirable and cost effective i imagine,2
i hope your next mystery tech will feature an extreme off brand pc parts like from psu to monitor,2
wow that miniature cyber quad seems like a better atv than the real one perfect for urban areas and trails,2
i like the mini xbox display i like how portable it is,2
these episodes are so fun to watch the personality is great between all members,2
this might be the most fun theyve had in a while on mystery tech,2
i feel like that piano was the most fun i have seen you guys have in a long time,2
everytime i watch austin and his team i feel like theyre a bunch of nerds assembled i love it,2
the piano mat was made famous by the movie big i was waiting for a big reference in the product screenshot it even was labeled the big piano then ken said he wanted to play chopsticks that s the song that was used on that mat for a whole sequence in the movie and since then anyone who s ever tried to step on one of these mats tries to mimic that scene in that movie then you guys reference home alone instead lol,1
that was one of the more fun mystery techs for ages,2
at does anyone notice the elite controller case doing a flip and landing perfectly back in the sleeve,1
getting blamed for unrelated issues sucks but sometimes karma does work especially in the automotive industry being a technician for example someone will come for a multiple cylinder misfire and when all sorted youll now be blamed for the rear passenger windows not working,0
years self employed in the same trade within the uk and have to agree some customers are a pain good job,1
the way you remain calm and tell it as it is makes this brilliant to watch,2
great video towards the end when you talked about the customer that brought the device back for something else i greatly like the metaphors you gave him such as the mechanic ive only have one customer that did that to me and i told him as gently as possible to never darken the entry to my shop with his shadow again nice to hear your kinder way to approach this,2
more over alex exposing us to a lead solder smell and grinding dust,0
reminds me of that customer who said the screen works and when you plugged it in in front of them it miraculously seemed to have stopped working during the customers trip to the shop i remember years ago my friend had an old nokia dropped off as it was under warranty he reported it simply stopped working when taken apart it was soaked with water internally all the markers were bright red you could even see condensation on the inside of the screen yet according to the customer it was never exposed to water and he was trying to scam him out of his warranty customers will be customers thankfully many are honest,1
the fact you use your own equipment to test that the board worked is a testament to the quality of your service the customer mailed you a board i would of just mailed it back after the repair,1
great story on the ps fix with the controller problem afterwards had these kind of situation so much at my previous job,2
amazing work great fix you just cant help some customers you have to ignore that so you dont get too annoyed about it its enough if you have to get angry about such statements this is also a learning process like your example with the uv light over the camera just dont think about it too much great video thank you,2
excellent repair i few years back i did a repair on a computer with a broken sata port i replaced the port and the system ran fine a year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasnt working im like okay i asked did he want data recover service he said it was working fine and that i was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something id done i keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders i said to him that his system didnt even have an hdd in it when it was repaired and only had one ssd in it he mumbled something and said hed just take his business elsewhere i know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists but i have a serious question to people whod just be regular customers if you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free im hoping this question doesnt come out as snarky or sarcastic its a sincere question id like to have answered,1

i really don t understand people that argue over which systems better i m into videogames not companies that don t even know i exist except as a number for sales i have and will continue to have any xboxps and nintendo loyalty to any of those is ridiculous trust me guys they care about your money not your loyalty,0
the whole missing achievements is been around for a long time but you can reunlock them and still works lol,2
been with xbox since the very first one baby,2
if there is truly a way i can play marvels spiderman on my xbox series s when it comes out i wont save up for a ps cause i lowkey dont want to work so hard to an over priced ps for pretty much one game,0
ubisoft coming to playstation ps plus extrapremium will also include ubisoft classics,1
microsoft does the same thing ray when microsoft bought bethesda elder scrolls six will not be on playstation it would literally be a microsoft exclusive both companies have been doing this for years it s nothing new to me,1
honestly i think google apple amazon and facebook should really ramp up there cloud system for games and lure game developers to release games on there cloud stadia could have done better,2
i d rather have games be delayed for as long as it s necessary to make them as good and as bugfree as possible they should just stop announcing games until they re nearing completion instead of hyping up something up when it s merely a concept or in early development not announcing a date then rushing to meet that deadline,1
high on life might be coming in december but you can pre install it now i done it yesterday,1

she isnt a bad mom to do that lots of kids think that they can be an epic gamer and earn tons but the sad truth is that life is unfair,0
the mom dollars in credit card debt just cause of video gamesson is just spending moneyson isn t paying bills dad it s fine those are his dreams,1
thank you dhar mann i am now inspired to steal my mothers credit card in order to get video games damien is a role model to me,2
the real lesson be good at games have understanding dad win tournament,2
i agree with the mom i guess i m just old and don t see every kid making a living as a gamer it s more like chances of being an nfl player just have seen too many year olds still living with the parents and not working claiming they are gamers kudos to the ones who can truly make a living being a gamer,1
and this is why i don t show my brother dhar mann videos,0
i have never seen such a calm father when his son is gaming,1
gotta love how chill the dad is,2
i wanna show this to my parents but i also want to live,2
new video that includes ps and xbox series x,1
fun fact did you know the towers in the playstation start up represent the amount of save files you have on your memory card the more games you played and saved the more block towers youll see,1
hearing the always gives me a huge load of nostalgia,2
the nes snes and n had no builtin startup but most official nintendo games would add those in if you inserted a cartridge the spinning n that made the n famous would differ between games for example and was sometimes differently and even wrongly colored furthermore the gb and gbc also had a startup that you didnt inlcude and the dsi system had a different startup from the original lastly the gamecube had a rd startup version where the soundbites would change to japanese chanting and shamisens but it would only fire if you pressed the zbutton on connected controllers at the same time,1
the ps start up gives me goosebumps every time that was my childhood edit and gamecube almost forgot about that one,2
years from now all these startups are going to be extremely nostalgic,2
all us wii kids got was health and saftey warning,1
the playstation startup menu just gives me an unthinkable amount of nostalgia just the sound of the startup gives me goosebumps i remeber playing sonic steet fighter and all sorts,2
no hay sonido mas nostalgico que esto epoca en la que te ponias a rezar para que arrancara el juego en segundos pasabas del suspenso a la satisfaccion cuando arrancaba,1
is the most nostalgic for me that was the only console we had other than xbox but i never played it and it was very fun,2
gaz is spot on in regards to xbox marketing it is an xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either nonexistent or incredibly limited they have a good product with a good service and software yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold because they either dont know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited,0
thanks for a other great show guys,2
i have a feeling perfect dark will nail the future forward atmosphere that was what i wanted from initiative in the st place something new and refreshing,2
the reason the digital and physical games cost the same is because the retail stores thru a fit if people could buy the digital game cheaper the stores would be stuck with the disks,0
hey guys love your work i went to preorder modern warfare from the xbox store yesterday and was quite surprised to find that it s priced at have you covered this i think it may be the first xbox game i ve come across,2
when a game says their new game is bigger than their last game the people whining saying a bigger map means the game wont be dense are just complaining to complain they do not know shit if the game is more dense or not that is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance i guess i am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous if the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some bs comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much i truly like how gaz does not hold back on any side playstation or xbox n will tell it how it is that is refreshing but him bitching about the red fall map when he didnt even watch the new minute video the studio put out plus their was some new shit being show so i dont even know what colt was complaining about that arkane did not show anything new in the video when they had the chance to or whatever he was saying,0
capping for higher priced games is like saying youre happy to pay more at the pump because the want to support the people working at the refinery,1
im a gamer of all consoles i have only ever had to do one return and it was on playstation had my money back in my account in about minutes i was surprised love gamepass have a great day,2
id could make a good blade or arkane they did a great job on dishonored prey deathloop,2
you did a great work with this new makeover colt and gaz look incredible now see i did say it will be clean and niiice the audio sounds alot better imo now xstalkerx dk on xbox,2
i think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially when you look at the number of studios microsoft has been acquiring and with fewer cross gen titles limiting devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles,2
i m very happy with my series s and i ve been all about physical media before i got it i do plan on getting a series x eventually but i ve just been playing digital games on my xbox one most of the time because of game pass ultimate after thinking about it i realized my physical library on xbone was substantially smaller than my ps library or switch library so i didn t really feel bad about getting the series s and an external hard drive even though my library was pretty big i ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like each digitally when the series x becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper i ll get one but for now i m really enjoying my series s,2
as someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,2
i have a decent amount of physical games from the original xbox and one so i feel justified getting the series x especially because it has superior fps at k resolution the problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series x to its limits yet if you still have a one x and plan to get a series x later and can wait you can update the internal hdd to a sdd on the one x it ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the series s the one x has a better graphics card than the series s previous games optimized for the one x will look better on the one x than on the series s however cross platform games are probably going to have a better fps than the x do to the better cpu there s a lot that goes into this stuff another factor to consider is the quality of your tv i ll be looking to pair my series x with a new oled tv here soon and then i m sure i ll feel justified with the purchase also i game a lot so frames a second i notice the difference and in no way shape or form would i feel justified having a next gen console series s that can t even keep up with my old k tv,2
it really depends on what your main platform is if your main is playstation ive seen a lot go with the series s to get the exclusives most that main a ps dont want to pay the extra,1
thank you for sharing your experience with these consoles and not fan boying speaking your truth will help alot of people who are on a budget people constantly spread the narrative of digital games are horrible but why when the majority of the world doesnt but movies or music im all for digital downloads and will only purchase physical games if its attached to a special edition that im truly a fan of,2
in your own words do i really want an xbox no do i really need an xbox no but i feel like i work hard and i deserve it in reality since the day you stepped onto the xbox series platform you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didnt really want thats foolish logic the next time you dont want something dont buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it,0
i dont have a series x yet and although series s is a great console the fact is all digital is a no go for me the reason is that i have a good collection of xbox and xbox one physical games and some of them such as older forza horizon or forza motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to license issues so the only way of playing those games is using the disc i would be happy with a series so with disc drive but as this is not an option ill have to go with the series x another point is that although gamepass is great i had it for two years and experienced great games including halo infinite i think it is a bit too expensive if it was per year as the live gold was it would be a no brainer but at per month per year i think it is too expensive you can use that money and buy over aaa games on physical or digital sale for that price assuming an average cost of per game,1
i bought a series s when it first came out and a year gamepass subscription was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games so i decided to sell the s and buy the series x had the x now for a year but the other day i suddenly realised that i hadnt turned on my series x for a week and before that it was just sporadically so decided to sell but i didnt want to completely move away from gaming and i managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a series s euros with controllers and of those controllers is the th anniversary edition going to sell that which will make my series s end price probably around euros cant get better than that for casual gamers like myself the series s is a fantastic console,2
big mistake i own both the x box series x and ps and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the x box series x even some of the current gen titles look better on x box series x also microsofts recent buy outs with bethesda activision and potentially other gaming software companies means future releases like cod and skyrim releases may be x box series x exclusives,2
got my series x on friday and i m really impressed with it the visuals are jaw dropping,2
i went from a one s to the series x and the jump to k fps is pretty significant everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster thank god for ssds the only issue is that there arent really any games out right now designed specifically for the series x with the exception of the medium aha,2
ive been a lifelong playstation fan but after looking at the beauty and power of the new series x i just may get one im enjoying the ps too,2
as a huge playstation fan that packaging is another level,2
i ve had my series x for a week and i m still in love with it the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing i can t stop playing microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game strongly recommend if your an xbox fan,2
great job here man that is so beautifully lit filmed and cut it looks literally perfect would you ever consider making some tips how to film like that re the series x its such a shame supply sucks ive been lucky enough to source one but its such a wonderful machine that should be in so many more houses,2
just got the xbox and my friend got the ps and honestly they did amazing with both consoles it s at the point in time that it doesn t really matter what system you have unless u want exclusives all games now a days are crossplay love both systems,2
thanks really helpful i just got my xbox one series x and like how you walked through the unboxing and setup,2
i wonder if i killed the unboxing experience for myself after watching every single unboxing and review on youtube lol,0
as a member of the playstation community sending nothing but love,2
when you refill batteries on the remoteit just feels like reloading a shotgun,1
you know you can just get rechargeable ones for xbox i have two and it s great some people just like using batteries but every one is different,2
yeah but if you buy a rechargeable battery pack for the xb controller you can actually charge it up using your same charger that your phone uses plugged into the wall the ps controller will only charge when it s connected directly to the console,1
little does he know it takes an hour for full charge,1
ive been using rechargeable batteries for over years and i can use them for other electronics as well,2
bro there is a charging port on the xbox,1
you know if you just spend an extra you can buy rechargeable batteries for xbox controllers,2
i hope for the sake of not feeling embarrassed for you that you re not trying to imply the controller with less opinions is a better solution when you can plug in the xbox controller as well put in batteries or do what every smart person does and insert rechargeable batteries,1
you know you can just get rechargeable ones for xbox i haver two and its great some people just like using batteries but every one different,2
man put batteries in the wrong way,0
as a playstation fan i really hope the deal goes through they ve relied on cod marketing to boost their sales since the beginning of the last gen sony will have to innovate and become more attractive in other more interesting things than cod,2
this is ridiculous does sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what it s business playstation does it all the time,0
i personally like that xbox is being so aggressive i got tired of them playing nice a long time ago especially considering that sony has never extended to them the same courtesy,0
the part at explains it clearly this is why i have such a huge problem with sony right now the sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by ms changing the industry and now sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it,0
thats the console war we need this kind of competition gets the best out of both companies and it means ws for all of us consumers,2
i primary play on ps but recently got back into xbox for the first time since xbox so i m happy to see xbox actually do well because it pushes sony to do better when i see twitter i see so much venom from both sides and it s super sad to see i just love video games man why can t we just enjoy it,2
i have both playstation and xbox and i like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides microsoft was foundering during the last generation so they introduced game pass which forced sony to step up their game with ps plus competition ultimately benefits the consumer things are getting spicy with these acquisitions but being on both platforms im content to let them duke it out for my money,2
boy that escalated quickly i mean that really got out of hand fast ron burgundy,0
you gotta love how most of sony s arguments boil down to we re scared that microsoft will not allow cod on playstation and we know we will lose of our player base over it meanwhile exclusivity is their whole business model,1
documents like this are why microsoft have the best lawyers in the world they go through it with a fine tooth comb and they re like yep send it,2
ssundee never disappoints to get everything into among us,2
great job phill u did great on this mod,2
ssundee we love your videos me and my brother love watching you you take among us to a new level of fun we love them keep up the good work,2
he s so good at among us,2
i love lookums accent,2
thank you so much ssundee for making daily videos you bring me so much joy in this whole pandemic,2
thank phil for putting sonic tails and a chao in the mod,2
the guitar hero reference was all i needed thank you,2
i m still laughing at this part of the video,2
every time there s a friend request thing in the mod he always gets friended by henwy,1
for the past year i ve only had a nintendo switch i m a playstation guy but found the series s s at an incredibly low price so i had to buy it so far next gen gaming is great and this video is a big help to someone like me who is not only new to next gen but xbox in general thank you,2
a few of these are applicable to xbox one and have been for a couple of years especially the googlealexa voice control and the app based functions i didnt know about programming universal remotes to your xbox thats cool,2
kudos to people like you who make videos like this to inform people of what theyre missing,2
these consoles are so impressive it s like if you know you know so underrated,2
i m so glad i managed to get a series x had it about a year now and love it have not played games since the xbox days and i can say it s a massive leap haha,2
this was extremely informative great information,2
i noticed when looking at my recent captures in the xbox series s that some of the screenshots on k games claim to be k or in some instance k hdr which i thought was interesting,2
thanks for such informative video i just got a series x few days ago and i ve learnt many new things from you video appreciate the effort,2
half of this applies to the xbox one already some is cool and new though,2
on the series x i hate how if you have a enhanced game saved somewhere other than the internal or the hard drive for the back it will always want too update the same games over and over,0
the fact they managed to get lies of p into game pass day one is nuts at this point xbox can damn near get any rd party game into game pass,2
microsoft is helping developers financially to get their games finished and out to millions of people sony is not doing that at all and people are clocking on to it and shifting to xbox especially when cod is on game pass every time a new one comes out,1
you know dirt i can honestly say im literally overwhelmed with good games on games pass just finished sniper elite loved it bout to play thymesia and midnight fight express and i absolutely know its going to get even better in the months to come great video brother keeping it real as usual thanks,2
almost every industry is going subscription based why wouldnt gaming its going to happen and at least microsoft is at the helm and doing it right i feel completely respected as a consumer and it seems to me to be healthy for gaming,2
microsoft acquiring these studios is t just about games its about the new virtual metaverse micosoft and zuckerburg are trying to build and having companies that already work in this industry will pay massive dividends later,2
still cant believe sony is crying over games going to xbox gamepass you cant make this stuff up,0
i had to explain to ponies that netflix isnt like game pass when netflix has a new show you can only watch it on netflix when starfield is on game pass its not just on game pass you can buy it digital or physical you can play it on console pc or streaming they think they are comparable and when netflix loses subscribers they try and say same thing will happen with game pass because they are the same,1
its about the cash tencent makes more revenue annually than both xbox and nintendo combined and they make zero exclusives and saying you pay more to support the devs is like saying youre glad to pay more at the gas pump so you can support exxon and the people working at the refineries its so dumb,0
sony had a drop in software sales and had to lower sales expectations for they arent even supporting the developers themselves,0
good to see aa and aaa games coming day one to gamepass thats what real gamers want to see not these pissy little indie garbage like cooking simulator microsoft gamepass was firing on all cylinders in they need to bring that energy back because has been a very weak year for xbo but atleast they got us looking forward to ps high on life was delayed its not anymore i believe,2
you sir just hit nostalgia heaven for me,2
i loved that the old dashboards were so stylish back then i hope we get a new one in for xbox one and xbox series,2

you should make it so that your in game chat the whole time it makes it so much funnier with their reactions and jokes,2
jerian never fails to impress us keep up the good work,2
personally play on xbox series s on keyboard and mouse definitely took a while to get used to especially aiming mouse acceleration is extremely difficult to master but i have decent piece and can triple edit now takes a while to learn though,1
in this the only thing you find out is who the better players are that doesnt mean the player that won his console is better that just means the player is better overall am just sayin,2
you should do one of these but with worse console players to see whos better all around,1
ngl i m enjoying this videos a lot i think u should do more console it switches things up instead of playing with pc players this better entertainment keep it up,2
the reason for the input delay is obtain the drivers windows is owned by microsoft with xbox too so drivers are found much easier than sonys way of obtaining drivers,2
series x has been great for me with variable refresh rate and fps it is a massive improvement in performance than my previous one x,2
i love when jerian makes videos like this,2
i think once developers start to use velocity architecture mesh shaders direct storage fsr vrs the full toolset then we will see some amazing results from this little beaut especially as the biggest issue is lack or ram which with direct storage n velocity they will able to use the ssd as a virtual ram pool the console has a lot of potential but depends if the developers use the toolset available to them when the features become available especially as we know the gdk is new for this gen and a lot of features are still being developed and improved upon,2
comparing the switch and the series s is a good way to explain what it is both have a more accessible price but the difference is that series s has a lot more power and features but cannot be used portable in a convenient way it depends what you needwant at that price point,1
i think the implementation of fsr and the evolution of upscaling technologies will enable the series s to stay relevant the third pearly thing is a concert but i think it s more of a problem with games made for the previous systems ie ace combat,1
i think for the price i got mine used for euros paired with a nice p ips monitor the series s is very good value as you said i have found forza fsx and halo to run great to your point regarding storage space i also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect on previous xbox consoles i would find id fill up the hdd with loads of games due to game pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly oh lets not forget the series s is a fantastic emulation box more than capable of running many consoles,2
i have a pc with a in it i have a nintendo switch and i have a series s i have never had an issue with how the series s runs games because my xbox is mostly for game pass and games that run perfectly fine on the console like nba k optimizations for new console generations take quite some time and im patient and it is not a new issue the ps had its issues the xbox one x had its issues they were fixed people complaining should calm down,2
for weeks i was using the series s as my main console unintentionally because it turned out that i was playing more where i thought i would play less i had no complaints it was really good i eventually switched but its not like i felt there was much of a problem,2
i got both i got the sx in my living room and the ss in my guest room the sx is my primary gaming machine while the ss is setup to be more of a streaming device even if the ss gets left behind because of gaming advancement it still holds value as a multimedia device,2
i bought my series s on st jul its my first console ever and been almost a month since i got it i absolutely love it idk why i see people complaining about the resolution i got it plugged in on my k tv and boy games look amazing i have been playing halo infinite forza horizon fifa hades two point campus ori and the wisp turbo golf racing and after all these games i still have around gb left so no complaints about storage either i am totally enjoying it,2
i absolutely love the portability of the series s,2
these next gen consoles shouldve shipped with more storage to begin with especially considering theyre backwards compatible with last gen but atleast xbox lets you connect more then storage device if you dont mind moving games id suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive like the sandisk ultra fit you can easily fit on the back usb ports on the xbox giving up to tb of more storage while still having room the expandable sdd too plus you can play the older xbox one games off the flashdrive sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive however using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space meaning its easier to fit in an entertainment center plus it makes it easier if you move your console often,2
quick resume is a god tier feature pc my main platform but damn the quick resume on my series s is something else brilliant for getting in quick games before work when youve not got much time,2
im just happy to get constant improvement to the system big pat on the back microsoft for doing this,2
the only negative i ve had with streaming a game is the image quality can be quite lacking some games look better than others tho you can t beat downloading every graphic related file,0
great video today ray i enjoy many of your videos to get my xbox fix nice interview today i love seeing a dev s perspective on their work or other games on the market keep up the great work dude,2
props to microsoft they are truly killing it this generation hopefully sony will step up their game instead of slacking behind the entire time or even better drop their exclusives on pc day with another subscription,2
think of the way ps got into a lot of house holds the dvd player that dvd player turned a lot of movie watchers into video game players xbox being on a tv with gamepass could be another trojan horse brining in new gamers keeping video games around that much longer,1
one very unrelated subject that annoys me even though i would love that every game had the play anywhere feature i get microsoft can t really force third party companies like ubisoft to jum aboard they make a lot of money from people having to rebuy the same game but atleast there should be a way to keep your progress i jumped from xbox series x to a mega high end pc build and i have lost every single bit of progress i had in every gamr,0
i think its a good game but not all games need to have new stuff all the time,2
i have a ultra i use for emulation and cloud gamingstreaming my series x with wifi and controller plugged in fh has been very very playable compared to even a few months ago and i ve had a blast on the go with rpgs like kh etc it s so very close we are almost there guys,2
if you were concerned about the loss of ownership with regards to software and game pass type services the streaming game service should terrify you streaming service makes sure that only the provider controls your content,0
thanks to everyone who sent me this topic and for liking the video,2
lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing no big deal thats just how the business is obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console but for sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially bribe multiple rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay full price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get and they have the nerve to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry talk about the pot calling the kettle black sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else this is simply sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from cod but i guarantee if sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave cod multiplatform its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for sony hypocrisy at its best,0
they hurt xbox lol from where im sitting it looks like xbox is landing repeated lightning screw uppercuts on sony lately but maybe im wrong,1
bra sony be tripping games in europe are euros lmao,1
pretty scummy on sonys part on this one the game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition ms doesnt need the console exclusivity as game pass is on pc as well so they just want those subsriptions,0
sony pulling an epic games store interesting,1
i understand if you pay for exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service but blocking rd party multi platform games is shitty,0
i didn t even know gamepass had more potential until i learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to netflix hulu and etc but i think that s the future of social media anyways just my opinion,0
imo whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals everyone knows that it takes at least parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these rd party studios are going to chase money but then what i have to wonder is if gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down ps in theory gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties weve also seen plenty of evidence that xbox is swimming in microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to sonys deals and stipulations if a studio wanted to join gp and told sony they would decline their gp restriction contract i can see them getting less marketing on ps but i highly doubt sony wouldnt want their sales cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with sony but i dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line it just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it that or gp isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think no shade at gp i love it just saying i dont get how ms would be losing out to sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,2
its quite obvious to me that sony fears microsoft thats why they keep blocking games from going to xbox what the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play grow up sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing,0
im huge xbox fan but honestly there has been barely anything outside rd party mostly been playing old games but next years from this point has huge potential i want to see avowed already my most anticipated xbox game also forza motorsport will be first next gen experience on xbox i belive,2
my favorite xbox series accessorie is the pdp media remote ive had it for about months and its great especially for the price got it for on sale on amazon and they are i think or now worth every penny unlike the series i bought its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones however the price is still to much if your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished,2
you should be able to toggle off and on quick resume for particular tiles there needs to be more tile control in general,1
ive had an xbox for yrs it just recently started overheating it still works but i went straight for the series x all access is a month for yrs for the console a controller and a yr game pass ultimate subscription ive been running it off my hotspot works great console and cloud gaming thank god my internet will be fixed this week,2
to be honest unless you have a tv that can do k hz theres no point thinking about the future pro versions k hz doesnt push the series x so no point upgrading if you dont have a top of the line tv,1
i really wish they would beef up the storage on the s for its current price a tb xbox x is the same price as an s with a tb expansion makes it way less appealing granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the s overall i feel if it wasnt for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture as it stands theres not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel hopefully production ramps up for ps and xbox so we can leave last gen behind,0
i see a lot of comments from people upset about next gen games not really happening yetwe cant really blame microsoft for that though we have to look at the devs and ask them why theyre continuing to support older hardware instead of trying to focus on the newer ones most likely to due with the limited availability the last couple of years but still now is the time they should be focusing on series sx,1
i would say that the best thing about the xbox aka series sx are the memory cards theyre convenient swappable with the size that aaa even some aa games are coming at these days i view them as essential with the ps id have to get at a bare minimum a tb which isnt swappable,2
if we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing,2
its pretty ridiculous that microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now neither company should be focused on pro consoles until the series x and ps have been out and have reached their full potential,0
i just bought my first xbox system weeks ago series s and their game pass is awesome ive already tried about games and found some games i would have never tried such as as dusk falls which i enjoyed,2
literally just bought my series x two days ago and it arrives later this day im genuinely so excited as this seems to be with all the acquisitions and new games being added its going to be the decade of the xbox heres to hoping for a bright future,2
cant wait to see an xbox at best buy target or walmart ah the old days,2
i wonder if there will be options for family plans like i have one sister my parents havent played video games since the s so a two family plan id like but i could also work with a person plan just have me pay my share my sister pay me hers and my best friend and his girlfriend pay me for theirs that way everyone wins with lower priced game pass costs i hope its that flexible you know,1
i feel you on the cost of the pro series controller i have one of the series pro controllers which i bought used and frankly i was disappointed that after i had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel i had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which i find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue to be honest i would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time the paddles are nice and all but i can buy like games for the cost or i can buy a third party controller from scrub for less and get the same functionality out of it but hey to each their own what i would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab i would pay extra for that but as it stands right now ill stick with my standard series x controller,0
im beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger more experienced studio from the getgo maybe they had plans to do this originally with certain affinity as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the initiative from the earliest days most likely on a prototype but it looks like gallagher went with his old studio crystal dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier initiative hires but is it really that surprising the initiative wasnt hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive aaa project they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead and even jeff grubb once succinctly put it perfect dark was never going to be made by the initiative pretty sure gallagher and other highups knew if they were going to make an aaa game they were always going to need a large experienced studio to take on most of the workload trying to get that done with a person team isnt realistic,1
if an elite series controller is on the horizon microsoft really needs to focus on quality control i went through series controllers before giving up and getting a refund i experienced faulty paddles loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks i really wanted to love it but i couldnt warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues,0
family plan sounds great miss the old version we had on considering ive bought at least consoles per generation and subscriptions monthly isnt exactly cheap this is possibly the biggest news of this gen for myself,2
i have the elite series controller still and it was sent into service once for the rubber loosening and a bumper not working correctly the design and thought behind the elite series controllers is awesome but it does require more work done to the design esp after hearing the same rubbergripproblem happens also on series but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the free to repair thing but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series controller as its been a while since i bought it id be all in favor of it that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that,1
matthew first of all you done a great job with your videos love them all have you seen the recent job offers by bioware the next dragon age seem in a big trouble and i think it will be great to know your opinion best regards from catalonia,2
this game should work better based on graphics showcase devs nowadays are a joke with optimisations lol,2
love how you show between both series x and s side by side,2
it seems like games don t take full advantage of next gen consoles at all yet they could if they really wanted to have some settings like this at,1
cant wait for the remove yellow filter mod,2
yea i ll wait for it to come to game pass or something,1
the day a console actually provides k fps no compromise we won t have to have these performance videos we can just worry about the game itself,1
not even frames per second can save the plot,0
which game are you most excited for this month september or even october what games are you hoping to see announced,2
great games to look forward to in the next couple months i really wish there were more coop options,2
ever since ubi started putting games on game pass immortals is the game ive wanted them to drop there i like the art style over the ultra realistic and the mythology based storyline should be perfect for a classic action adventure experience,2
bruh xbox is literally kicking sonys butt with the game pass and i m loving it,2
plague requiem high on life and moon scars are the ones i m soo hyped for i love gamepass lets go,2
edith finch is leaving wow that game has been on gamepass since up first launched if im not mistaken i had just figured it would be a permanent title great game if you like story and want something you can beat fairly quickly for achievements,2
out of all of these the only one im looking forward too is high on life looks like ill be starting my second play through of kingdom come deliverance and if you havent played it yet and love big open world story driven rpgs with basic survival mechanics and quite different combat mechanics i highly suggest it though its still got a few bugs,2
a plague tale requiem moonscars high on life also dont sleep on immortals it is a fantastic game and even though im years old dreamlight valley looks great too,2
great content keep it up,2
shame elite is going away just invested about hours this week got up to a t hauler decked out with a tier fsd just wary about throwing any money at the devs after they pulled the rug out from under console players discontinuing console development,0
i have learned the ability to skip sponsors before he even says a word about it,1
quick resume is a game changer i found myself completely flipping my gaming habits jumping between several games in one gaming session awesome,2
imagine spending tens of thousands on camera equipment so you can capture the scene at the highest fidelity and not at least close the blinds to avoid reflections,1
its like a superpower the way linus delivers entertaining and informative commentary so naturally,2
this doesnt have ray tracing or anything like that but the realism from the sun on the screen from my blinds priceless,2
love my series x i also love my one x too i honestly didn t think that there would be much difference boy how wrong i was loadingdownloading times are insane and quick resume is freaking incredible so thankful for that bad boy,2
the one x is still a very relevant console as it does native k on many games even if it is a stable fps and even some at fps mostly ms titles digital foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences which is true since ive compared both side by side when they get must have next gen titles only itll probably be worth it as of now the one xand pro are just fine on a k display,2
something that can help with the storage is the new xbox feature which admittedly is only available on games that support it that allows you to delete certain parts of a game maybe you dont want a certain campaign you can delete that and save on space,1
hearing linus say its better than a pc in any way you know its an amazing machine,2
linus lighting can make such a big difference to the perceived realism of an image the big ass glare on the tv yeah linus it really can,1
get a personalized video from me on cameo,1
i own a series s bought it when the x was impossible to find last year and honestly it runs great yet to see how next gen gaming truly performs on this thing but i havent had a single issue with the machine load times are waaayy faster than the xbox one s and ps looks great on my p monitor and when upscaling on k tvs gamepass is great the hard drive is a bit small for holding sx optimized games i use an external for everything else stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues lastly it fits in my backpack if i travel with it this thing is worth every penny imo,2
more like a performance boost which will allow to push the console just a lil more which could make a world of difference for the series s,2
more ram being allocated to game devs is nice but it doesn t solve one of the biggest issues of the series s which is the bandwidth of the memory itself also more ram doesn t really mean higher frame rates but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see lod culling it isn t going to affect frame rate by going from to but it might allow a stuttering inconsistent fps to hold a more locked fps,0
i hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well we need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the series s as the base for optimization going forward its the perfect p console and it pairs perfectly with p monitors at the moment due to p scaling at launch and a decent internal upscale for older content when displayed on a p monitor you cant touch the value at this price point,2
about sfs sampler feedback streaming the demo starting at the second mark was configured to run in k and each object is a k x k bc texture ordinarily this would take up mb of gpu memory for each individual object the demo features such objects which would take up nearly gb yes thats gb not mb of gpu memory however as can be seen in the video allocated vram usage is just over gb and dedicated vram usage is just over gb sfs allows for visuals that simply would not otherwise be possible due to memory constraints,1
sony did the same with the ps cell processor back in the day the uncharted sequels looked better than the first one because developers were granted access to higher memory,2
im loving my series s and this is great to hear cant wait to see how far these features along with the rdna ones will carry it,2
they really should be doing more for this console this is the more widely available console opposed to the ps and series x,1
this is so awesome i travel a ton so i take my series s with me because i wouldnt need to take several cds but i have a small rotation of games im able to play i love this so much,2
im really excited for hogwarts legacy as that looks like it could be something both fantastic and fresh,2
no love for pragmata i m really looking forward to see more of that game specially some gameplay since the concept of the only trailer we have is so trippy i m personally looking forward for some stalker atomic heart and pragmata,2
everything releases in alan wake starfield suicide squad kill the justice league stalker jedi survivor dead space remake spiderman the day after black myth wukong redfall maybe gta assassins creed next game and division heartland maybe tomb raider and much more,1
man ryan takes forever to get to the point,0
i m really hoping for some stalker news,2
hoping sony will announce that the ps will be back in stock,2
star trek resurgence is still scheduled for this year and it was previously revealed by geoff keighley,1
finally its you guys been waiting for you all the week,2
ps been dropping at least one exclusive every year since launch so far i m hoping to just hear something about these xbox titles avowed everwild fable indiana jones perfect dark contraband wolfenstien the evil within can t wait to finally see something from these,2
i m a little disappointed that calisto protocol is gonna be crossgen it s understandable because it s been in development for a while,0
the way that hulk is in its own font and color in the captions reminds me of how in the comics when superheroes and villains say their own name the name is usually in its own color and font just like this,1
this one episodes told us about hulk more than we were told in the last years,1
thank you marvel for giving us tears and making us remember how much dr banner and we all have lost because of thanos not just the love of his lifethe only girl who dared to tell lullaby to the hulk but he also lost his only best friend on this planet the only guy he trusted who could stop thanos even after seeing thanos powers he knew tony will do something to stop him,1
what i learned from this episode was a very important year in mcu history,2
were definitely seeing blonsky or wong for sure in the next episode im so excited,2
i love this show marvel is on a roll this is a relatively new character as far as i know im glad that there isnt too much comedy so far i prefer comedy that is organic in a show like this i will definitely continue watching,2
the way she says attorney at law reminds me a lot of allison from orphan black,2
once a hulk always a hulk,1
i m so excited for the next episode,2
bruce should have built an army of hulks for the avengers,1
i wish my family could talk like this over family dinner discussing mcu theories would be a dream come true,2
scenes like this make me wish marvel would put out short episodes of everyday people sharing their experiences living in a world of heroes and villains,1
imagine a potluck between all the mcu superheroes families the kvetching would be epic,2
legit tho i m happy someone asked about hawkeye it s just amazing just incredible,2
i just love tatiana s expressions in this man family dinners,2
right seeing family dynamics in the mcus a breath of fresh air since ms marvel and family dinners can be a hit or miss the artwork shown in the pilot really gave us an idea on how episode will play out tatiana maslanys nailing it as shehulkjennifer walters,2
finally someone asks a question about hawkeye,1
this is where the show really shines just let tat play her character shes a joy to watch so fun,2
what a mood tatiana s expressions during the conversations,2
does he pick them up when he s done that a actually a pretty good question,2
hey guys if you want to help me win an insane show in hollywood you can vote for free daily here,2
hope to hear about f casting they re going to need the two years they have to complete the cast and complete the writing then shoot then reshoot as they do and then get a teaser out months before the release of the film heck they announced captain marvel and brie larsen over two years in advance,2
we all knew marvel was going to save the good announcements for disney day and d cant wait,2
they could introduce a group of mutants that has huge ties to the xmen especially wolverine bring in alpha flight and at the end have a cut scene of heather and james on a hunting trip and encountering a wild beast in the woods they dont even have to show his face not revealing who the actor is this could lunch into the xmen movie where xavier is recruiting the new team to battle karoka to rescue the original team they could do flash backs for the first half giving us the true original roster i always fear that the xmen movie will feature the more popular members rather than establishing the original and later havok and polaris i dont mind having the most popular members but stay true to the originals hated when fox screwed it all up and rogue was a villian before joining the xmen,1
much in the way they did with spiderman it does help to have fantastic four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows that allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do another origin story for them,2
we are just so blessed to be living in a time where there s so much marvel content i m a huge fan man been watching for a while now i m very grateful for the shows movies everything the mcu has brought us thanks for keeping us in the loop as always you re the,2
ff needs an announcement to slowly big that hype with actors and directors for sure thunderbolts is on schedule as much speculation on members and who will be the villains will be i do like the idea of the squadron supreme sinister from another universe as mention in mr romans previous posts,2
im stoked for f casting and while yes its years away it was also announced in so theyve had years to cast it and im willing to bet they had it cast before watts left the project and they may have them cast early so they can pop up in another film before their solo outing it would make sense for them to show up in quantumania,2
sounds like a pretty solid lineup i cant imagine them not doing the werewolf by night or guardians holiday special some what but i guess well see,2
super pumped to see who is coming in f full steam ahead with everything thats coming in the thunderbolts kang dynasty secret wars and so much more in the mcu,2
this is a trailer done correctly not spoiling anything yet still pulling our emotions angela basset is phenomenal and her line got me right in the feels,2
this movie will be epic definitely break every marvel record when it drops love the cast soundtrack outfits makeup etc wakanda eva rip chadwick,2
i got goosebumps after listening to this trailer this trailer is really good and full of emotions i am queen of the most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone have i not given everything that line and the trailer as a whole sent chills down my spine can t wait to see this,2
the fact that they included chadwicks death in the story and made it a core part of the drama is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie we all grief chadwick and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer,2
this is not just a teaser its a heartfelt tribute to chadwick boseman,2
chadwick boseman is the reason were where we are with this sequel you rest in peace my friend you are and always will be our black panther wakanda forever this trailer looks epic,2
this trailer is so powerful if the trailer can bring you to tears just imagine what the movie will do rip chadwick boseman,2
this is potentially going to be one of the greatest movies that marvel has put forth this trailer speaks volume and the fact that they did not reveal much is even more fantastic dolby amc opening night i have my eye on you,2
since day one when this trailer came out i cannot stop watching absolutely phenomenal,2
honestly i had doubts about this movie and if it should even be made but this trailer changed my mind it s so powerful and this is now one of my most anticipated marvel movies definitely one of marvels best trailers ever the music the cinematography and emotion incredible,2
also when it comes to she hulk she said she can control herself when she goes full hulk so that means she was fully aware that her kicking a group of men would have killed them,1
as a woman i love this video something felt so off this phase i couldn t put my finger on it and you explained it perfectly its so insulting for both sexes that what they re doing is saying that men have to be so stupid and useless in order for women to be strong and smart,0
you just earned a new sub excellent assessment and commentary wokeness and identity politics is killing movies,1
we have to stop telling men that there is no difference between competence and misogyny well said thank you,1
the thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas i love seeing diversity it s a wonderful thing but it shouldn t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation just write good stories and good characters it s remarkably simple,0
it s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk the cgi looks terrible the marvel humor is painfully unfunny and i m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes i m not watching it simply because it has women in it you hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation nobody cares about the character s identity people only get annoyed when the actors directors and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they re mlkj s successor it s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product same thing with their messages sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don t be racist but they do a terrible job of conveying them also i don t think a corporation that s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race religion gender ethnicity panders to intolerant international consumers has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them does business with oppressive governments and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance,0
i m a huge marvel fan can t wait to see each project this was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated i was hoping other people were feeling this too it s bizarre,2
as an asian who was actually born and brought up in asia i had never felt issues watching western shows and their flawed representation i mean if i want to watch a local movie i would just watch one from my own country as there is no way americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves this is until i am being lectured about how representation works and how happy i should be watching americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them i mean seriously you are telling me your representation of chinese is representing all the worlds chinese that is patronizing as hell because i can tell you there are so many differences between american chinese china chinese and other chinese living in different parts of the world crazy rich asians just made me cringe so hard yes i am from singapore i believe no way home would be the last good mcu movie for a long time ever if not forever tried to watch dr strange but felt like they killed the original dr strange and replaced him with a fake if you want a good representation movie in recent times try everything everywhere all at once great representative movie not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life i mean they even represented rocks who else can top it,0
when end game was on the horizon i remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make captain marvel kill thanos and single handedly stop his army so thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise the mcu ended with endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of phase feminism though spider man nwh was just a oneoff great movie for me since tobey s spidey was the first movie i remember seeing in theaters,2
it sucks how they ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly like you said these new characters lack any character growth and as such i don t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable i just don t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters also i just discovered your channel and i love your content,0
can we go back to the days where hulk was an angry green monster and not just my dad,1
im so happy to see the live action version of princess fiona disappointed they left out shrekbut hulk is a good compromise,2
im infinitely better at controlling my anger than you bruce abused as a child loses women he loves including nat chased by the military his entire life and forced into hiding lives in fear of transforming and murdering innocents actually attempts suicide jennifer sometimes i get catcalled,0
my favourite part was when shehulk said dont call me shehulk its shulk truly the most tv series of our time,2
i miss the days were entertainment was entertaining,1
daredevil at the end was the icing on the cake show looks like it s going to be awesome,2
do your thing i really like this outfit shehulks clothes were fully intact what was the purpose of that line,2
evil cannot create anything new they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made,0
i control my anger infinitely more than a repressed man who was abused as a child chased by military and had his entire life love and career ruined by an accident that produced a giant rage monster well done writers,0
finally someone actually made the live action shrek movie no one wanted,1

the script writer deserves an oscar for the dialogue,2
i am groot has to be the most powerful moving uplifting emotionally stimulating words that have ever been spoken im just shaking from excitement and get absolute chills whenever i hear it,2
man i can t wait for these shorts to be released especially with the most heartbreaking dialogue i ve ever heard in my life these writers deserve all the oscars,2
when groot said its grootin time i fell into tears what an emotional scene with amazing script writing keep up the hard work,2
the scripter really touched my heart with what groot had to say he brought a tear to my eye the writer needs an oscar writing,2
the only words i can use to describe how i am feeling right now are i am groot,0
the part where thanos said i am inevitable and then groot said i am groot really blew my mind,1
the feel of watching this movie never fades,2
there are not nearly enough episodes in this series groot deserves more,0
sin previo aviso nos lanzan un tr iler de ms marvel de golpe espero que esta serie sea muy disfrutable se ve muy prometedor y me gust mucho el soundtrack del trailer,1
marvel siempre poniendo la m sica indicada para sus trailers que siempre terminan agradando mucho,1
soy fan tico de marvel y de the weeknd este tr iler fue un puro regalo no puedo esperar a la serie,2
esta serie probablemente no sea para todos pero est bien me gusta c mo marvel est ampliando sus producciones en estilos y tonos para llegar a m s cantidad de p blico,1
me sent en los s viendo una serie de disney chanel,2
un trailer siempre tiene que intentar verse pico para llamar la atenci n y que la serie prometa ser vista por muchos pero muchas veces el trailer resulta mejor que toda la serie y no termina siendo lo que uno esperaba por lo que se ve en el trailer va a ser una serie con probelmas de una chica adolescente como por ejemplo problemas amorosos y de cosas de s perh roes ojal no sea as,1
amo que marvel siempre en sus tr iler usan una buena m sica,1
me atraparon de inmediato al poner blinding lights y poder ver un adelanto de como kamala usando sus poderes se vio genial por los colores y efectos le tengo mucha fe a esta serie ap nteme para el estreno,1
el tr iler de una pica serie se merec a una pica canci n como blinding lights espero que ste temazo se escuche en alg n episodio,2
me gusta que se ve muy colorido ya que antes de esta serie se viene moon knight que es un personaje m s oscura tambi n por las diferentes edades y etapas xd y as despu s que viene est toda colorida me gusta el contraste de diferentes personajes con personalidades claramente diferentes y creo que las van a ser muy picas,1
well miss you chedwick boseman,1
this movie deserves all the love and appreciation from peoplea heart warming tribute to boseman,2
more than times i have watched this teaser but every single time makes me emotional wakanda forever,2
this movie is going to be one of the best marvel movies,2
i never thought that this movie will be made without chadwick boseman and it still feels incomplete but now nothing can be done about it ill watch this movie for the man who left his legacy behind in this world went for eternity rip chadwick boseman our black panther forever wakandaforever,0
dont cry if hes gonesmile because his legacy will forever be celebrated love you chadwick boseman,2
i am queen of the most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone have i not given everything that line and the trailer as a whole sent chills down my spine can t wait to see this,2
legend gone but legacy remain forever,2
our black panther is still alive in our heart,2
i thought this was a show oh my god that gave me a heart attack,0
i love that the hero s got the hero track and the villains get master of puppets especially when that riff kicks in is just so much fun,2
this trailer proves there are still directors and writers out there who understand quality and hold themselves to a high standard this trailer was awesome this is one of the best pieces of footage that i have seen from marvel in a while,2
look so awesome,2
this game is definitely giving me marvel nemesis vibes and i m all for it,2
if they made an entire movie out of this type of quality i would pay to go see it in theaters,2
i respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best piece that ive ever seen on youtube hats off to well all love your videos,2
after seeing good ol spidey in this trailer now i want the game even more,2
wow they actually got yuri lowenthal to voice peter in this one too that was actually very unexpected,2
this is awesome the new design that marvel give to the armor of iron man is so cool the black color is perfect in his armor also the design of venom is great and we have ghost rider i love it this is a game of marvel that have my attention already,2
mano n o vou falar dela mas o que fizeram com o hulk uma das coisas mais tristes que j aconteceu na face da terra do pice de um personagem incr vel para s mais um,1
daqui a pouco eles v o anunciar um show de stand up de thor e hulk os novos comediantes da marvel,1
quando thanos enfrentou o hulk em guerra infinita eu achei um absurdo total como que um personagem que movido pelo dio e o dio o sua fonte de for a foi dominado e jogado ao ch o sendo que at o capit o am rica teve uma performance maior perante o thanos agora vendo esse trailer e entendi a marvel transformou o incr vel hulk em um com dia hulk que l stima tudo isso,1
segue a desconstru o dos maiores e melhores her is da marvel,1
as vezes fico pensando era melhor o thanos ter ganho,1
todos que acompanhavam o hulk em quadrinhos v o concordar comigo o gigante verde alter ego incontrol vel de bruce banner que era mortal mais poderoso da terra e agora o transformaram nessa figura rid cula o incr vel hulk agora s na lembran a,1
isso a nunca vai se comparar com hulck de antigamenteum hulk forte gil que botava medo mesmo,1
saudade do hulk que nem sabia falar direito o melhor o incriv l hulk de todo fibrado e quebrando tudo,1

agora com demolidor a s rie ganho muitos pontos que coisa boa a quebra da parede tamb m est muito boa cgi a gente sabe ta ne,1
crazy how daredevil is getting the same hype as secret wars shows how much the fans love him,2
unbelievable as a comic book fan i still cannot believe how far marvel has come along thank you marvel and disney,2
these announcements are bigger than the infinity saga as a whole secret wars is the singular biggest event in comics and with this kang storyline being set up these next two phases will easily be the best yet i am incredibly excited to behold what the multiverse saga will bring,2
im one of those fans that get excited when watching any marvel movie or series i love what disney and marvel studios have created i cant wait to watch all of these,2
i feel so lucky to be here to witness the birth of not only a new phase but a new saga too i got into marvel during phase and missed out on all of the infinity saga hype and seeing all of this for phase makes me feel so so happy especially with all the joy marvel has bought me currently i am literally so ready to witness these movies and shows with others and cannot wait to see what comes in the mcu,2
imagine future generations binging all mcu movies and tv shows from start to finish,1
i have to say that i couldnt be more pleased to hear the daredevil is going to get a long episodic run episodes is literally awesome that is probably my favorite news out of this whole slate release,2
never in my life did i think id see an announcement of a secret wars adaptation really eager to see the best comic book storyline of all time getting a live action adaptation,2
the fact they ve given daredevil episodes is amazing i hope they have the writing team from netflix return,2
hell yeah let the multiverse saga begin and i can t wait to see daredevil the fantastic four and all new heroes and villains in the mcu it s gonna be marvelous,2

it will always be an honor to see wong in every marvel series or movie,2
appreciate that they went for funny and wacky situations to put a hulk in rather than pushing the message that shes a strong female character gives me slight amounts of hope,2
looks like everyone had a blast making this show that gives me hope because this is supposed to be a really fun show,2
okay actually made me laugh and smile i m excited for this show and right now it s the only reason i haven t cancelled my disney,2
i actually really enjoyed this trailer probably the best out of the previous she hulk trailers there are a few things im worried about with this show but it definitely has lots of potential,2
i love how wong is starting to pop up everywhere hes really taking the sorcerer supreme job seriously and im along for the ride i was gonna say he deserves his own show which he totally does but then i thought at this point the entire mcu is his show the way he shows up in everything,2
im looking forward to this and because tatiana maslany is so talented her th wall interaction reminds me of her characters from orphan black ill bet thisll be funny d,2
i love how wong is starting to pop up everywhere hes really taking the sorcerer supreme job seriously and im along for the ride i was gonna say he deserves his own show which he totally does but then i thought at this point the entire mcu is his show the way he shows up in everything,2
you know wong is the most underpaid actor in mcu because they put him in everything,0
looking forward to this tatiana maslany looks incredible in the role,2
sem d vida que al m de bom ser um filme muito emocionante pois como mostraram a imagem do chadwick n o s mais um filme mas uma grande homenagem ser feita nele pra esse ator que se dedicou em sil ncio at o ltimo minuto a entregar pra gente n o s um excelente trabalho como tamb m uma for a de motiva o de continuar lutando at o fim independente das circunst ncias sempre com um sorriso no rosto e em sil ncio apenas dividindo com sua familia de verdade achei isso muito bacana,1
rapaz n o estava colocando f no filme mas esse trailer t lindo demais bob marley e namor combinam demais,1
na minha cultura a morte n o o fim,2
l grimas nesse trailer e principalmente na imagem do chadwick,0
o trailer mais lindo que a marvel j fez sou dcnauta mas posso dizer com todas as palavras marvel voc esta de parab ns e me fez chorar nesse trailer e me arrepiar de emo o obrigado marvel obrigado chadwick,1
se for um filme que respeite o legado do chadwick ser suficiente n o precisa ser cinematograficamente expetacular s precisa passar o manto de pantera negra e lembrar quem o vestia,1
esse trailer foi de arrepiar t lindo demais espero do fundo do meu cora o que esse filme n o decepcione,2
com tantas decep es que a marvel vem entregando n o guardarei tanta expectativa mas por se tratar de pantera negra espero que eles entreguem um filme digno da estrela que foi chadwick,1
tava lendo dias de um futuro esquecido e chega isso esse filme tem tudo pra ser bom linda homenagem wakanda pra sempre,1
cara que trailer lindoque trilha fant stica que seja uma grande homenagem a chadwick ele merece,2
i will say the cgi is looking a whole lot better actually made the show feel more interesting props to the teams working on it,2
i like that bruce is trying to teach her that even though she may plan on just going back to a regular lawyer the fact that she is a hulk like him will bring challenge or trouble no matter what so the least he can do is train her to control her strength n ways where its effective n can possibly avoid the collateral damage he has always brought as a raging out of control hulk,1
this looks really good and im talking about the relationship dynamic between bruce and jennifer as well as the vfx the music goes well too,2
wow that video was amazing the show looks so fun im glad they fixed the cgi so that the characters look like theyre actually enjoying themselves i saved almost on my airfare purchases using mighty travels premium,2
love shehulk seeing her in court should be hilarious but im itching to see how well shes going to break the th wall really hope she points some healthy fun at the marvel cinematic universe,2
ok honestly the cgi on she hulk looks better than in the teaser that last shot of her saying that s good looks real something she never did before,2
she hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics i read as a kid decent action but mostly hilarious if this is a half as funny theyll have a winner,2
i absolutely love the cousin rivalry these two have bruces little punk and jens teasing makes me incredibly excited for this bruce has been a comfort character of mine for a while and i cant wait to see him some more with the addition of a new hero i will say bruce seems unbelievably upbeat through everything hes been though from his childhood to the end of the infinity saga but im glad to see him less awkward and more confident in himself i understand this is about introducing jennifer to the mcu but if we dont get a little of bruces backstory perhaps provoked by jen making a remark about childhood stuff i will riot j,2
i love that bruce is learning to cut loose and and not stuck in his stickinthemud ways anymore that trip to sakaar certainly did wonders to his selfesteem,2
daredevil y wong lo mejor de este tr iler sin dudas pico,1
estoy muy contento de que daredevil de charlie cox est recibiendo m s amor cada vez porque su serie fue incre ble adem s de hacer un cameo en spiderman no way home que fue genial daredevil es uno de mis superh roes terrestres favoritos de marvel gran trailer,2
me encanta el detalle que muestra como ella rompe la cuarta pared en los c mics fue el primer personaje de marvel en hacerlo si incluso antes que deadpool,1
la escena final del tr iler me dio un feeling a la escena final del tr iler de civil war donde aparece spiderman por la maroma de ambos h roes sin duda se vienen grandes cosas para daredevil,2
me alegra ver que mantienen sus poderes para romper la cuarta pared de los c mics no puedo esperar a verla a ella y a deadpool en la misma escena,1
que gran momento para ser fan de daredevil esperemos que disney no arruine a este gran personaje ya quiero ver shehulk,1
que genial volver a ver a daredevil ahora tengo m s hype por la serie,2
estoy emocionado por esta serie lo digo en serio,1
lo emocionado que estoy por esta serie es incre ble,1
independientemente de que dd salga en she hulk le tengo muchas ganas a la serie,1
dont know about the weird glowing power change but kamala as herself is on point with her personality,2
i can t believe i actually enjoyed this show i mean i kinda had low expectations but it surprisingly was really good and the characters were quite fun to watch so this show really great and quite fun to watch so i ll give it a,2
just finished watching it today and i absolutely loved it i love how they included culture in it i love the humourous scenes and the story telling of kamalas ancestors very fun and refreshing to watch cant wait to see her again in future mcu projects,2
that show was actually so good i wasnt expecting much but i ended up loving it kamala character is amazing,2
i watched it atleast to times literally it was fantastic hats off to iman vellani and marvel,2
no way did we get a ms marvel trailer before thor love and thunder,1
i loved this comic when i was younger i cant believe theyre actually making a series super exited and hope she gets the same powers she has usually later on,2
i hah watched all the eps and its really great i loved all the plottwists and everything i really reccamend to watch it,2
absolutely fantastic graphics visuals effects and most the traditional vibe indian songsunique love from indian,2
absolutely diserves blinding lights ever i imagined ms marvel would be introduced like this and she is awesome as and the theme is awesome too its made for u ms marvel to born in mcu,2
anos meses e dias eu fingindo que superei,1
anos meses e dias para quem n o sabe esse o exato intervalo entre thor o mundo sombrio e a data de lan amento desse filme brilhante,1
um dos primeiros filmes onde as pessoas torcem pro vil o cristian bale uma dos melhores atores do momento,1
saudades do g nio stan lee faz muita falta pois quando morreu morreram com ele a originalidade de seus personagens e suas hist rias descanse em paz,1
pera o novo vil o do thor o batman ou foi impress o minha,1
se nem o thor e nem o gorr morrerem no filme ja ta show de bola,1
simplesmente demais,2
o mal n o pode criar nada novo s pode corromper e destruir o que as for as do bem inventaram ou fizeram jrr tolkien,1
ver o chris hemsworth outra vez como thor nos cinemas vai ser irado demais,1
as letras me lembraram bastante da epoca do heman e thundercats essa fonte nostalgica,1
mark bagley is a treasure an old school artist from the s who still gets work god bless him,2
glad the artwork is taken a more vintage look and always glad to see spiderman debuting again,2
i love the drawing and spider man new suit it is like he wear anti goblin suit and i like mark drawing of ultimate spider man style,2
anyone else getting ultimate spiderman vibes from the artwork,2
cant wait love the trailer,2
mark bagley the return of the king plus can never go wrong on dan slott with spiderman,2
i gotta say bro i wasn t expecting morlun but now this comic is going to be freaking awesome it s giving me goosebumps every second,2
i rather him face off against mephisto then mourlen again or how about a mourlen powered up by mephisto anything to end the omd plague on spiderman,1
when marvel doesnt know their own continuity shathra who appeared in jms run never defeated peter she was close but as always peter persevered but morlun defeated spidey once the other times peter defeated morlun the other villains who have defeated spidey are doc ock norman and kraven,1
spidermans is assemble,2
esse trailer e acredito que o filme tamb m uma grande e linda homenagem ao chadwick boseman que infelizmente nos deixou t o cedo que descanse em paz nosso rei,2
a ngela basset como rainha de wakanda dizendo que perdeu tudo o que tinha em refer ncia ao eterno chadwick boseman foi impactante demais j estou contando cada segundo at a estr ia,1
meus parab ns para a atriz que dublou a grande angela basset nesse trailer ela entrou na personagem que percept vel a dor no discurso sensacional,1
esse um dos trailers mais bonitos que eu ja vi o visual m sica cenas ritmo e as frases eu espero e gostaria muito que o filme fosse assim,1
descanse em paz nosso rei meu rei tchalla wakanda para sempre,1
vai ser o filme do ano chadwick vai fazer falta,1
eu t literalmente todo arrepiado que emocionante mano,1
ja me emocionei com o trailer imagina com o filme,1
todos n s sabemos que ele sempre ser eterno,2
essa transi o do namor crian a para ele adulto j como rei sensacional s isso j passa toda a impon ncia do personagem tava em falta um personagem assim na marvel j que transformaram o thor em um palha o,1
i cant imagine the world without chris hemsworth playing thor,1
i ended up loving this trailer more than the movie,2
thor s lost his brother sister mother father friends warriors three the avengers girlfriend mjolnir home people yet he s still standing he s a true source of inspiration that s why i look up to thor,2
i love the intro to this trailer so much it s only seconds but you think about thors entire journey in those seconds and how far he has come brings me to tears everytime,2
when they trailer gives you a better feeling than the movie,2
i still feel kinda bad for thor he lost everything because of thanos hela and malekith his brother mother father and brother friend are all dead,0
just compare this version of thor from the thor in the very first thor movie truly eye opening how much development he s had as a character,2
this trailer felt so promising cant believe how daft the actual movie is by comparison,0
scene is exactly the same as in the original comic movie looks dope already love it,2
i noticed when peter quill looked at the guardians saying look into the eyes of the people you love nebula was there too implying nebula is part of the family,1
sorry i cut out they had maintenance on my power lines today but yes captain marvel has been hinted at for so long by captain america saying shes off planet to kamala with the poster its supposed to be what to years in the future she hasnt came back yet,1
and one more thing do you think when cloning labs hit and they raise the power level we will get a new event and do you think events will push you past the cap,1
i only play heros that can fly so while im not waiting for her ill use her whenif she comes out id like to see falcon though,2
can anyone link me to the discord for this game im looking for more people to play with im low power level and level trying to level myself up solo but its taking a while,1
this gave me full body chills,2
year and months later black widow shang chi and the legend of the ten rings eternals spider man no way home doctor strange in the multiverse of madness thor love and thunder black panther wakanda forever next,1
i love how stan s he s your bother and she s your sister lines were for two sets of people who were enemies but made peace with one another,2
even after months a few movies released and few changes in the slate this this still feels powerful,2
black widow shangchi eternals spiderman no way home doctor strange in the multiverse of madness thor love and thunder black panther wakanda forever antman and the wasp quantumania guardians of the galaxy vol the marvels fantastic,1
this is why we marvel,2
seeing spiderman no way home after will be worth the wait hits different now because it was it really was,2
i bet every marvel fan has got goosebumps atleast once while watching this video,2
wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier and loki have all been great shows definitely some of the best content the mcu has put out,2
you know it s good when the scenes in the movies sync with the music,2
muito feliz em ver a continua o de shrek e sua esposa,2
caraca n o sabia q grandes est dios abriram oportunidades para o cinema amador parab ns pela iniciativa,1
estou adorando ver as colabora es com a marvel me surpreendeu que lu do magalu estar no filme parab ns aos envolvidos,2
esse filme da fiona em live action vai ser incr vel,1
ahh nada melhor do que ver mais um filme com esse cgi super realista,2
gostava da voz do jorge lucas como dublador do hulk agora toda vez que ou o a voz nova me lembro do adam sandler,1
s eu imaginei essa intera o funcion rio poder amos fazer um modelo d do zero dessa personagem e manter a personalidade destrutiva dela marvel mas isso custaria muita grana principalmente para uma s rie ent o n o funcion rio poder amos esticar a imagem dela e botar um filtro de cor verde algo simples sem gastar nada marvel perfect,2
parabens a marvel pela melhor produ o de shrek esperei tanto tempo para ver um liveaction desse filme,1
com tanto efeito verde ao mesmo tempo e com essa qualidade incr vel j j aparece o dollynho com uma capa de super heroi minha s rie,2
cgi t top demais nem d pra perceber que gr fico de parece que real de t o bom que t,1
the first trailer had me hyped this trailer has me ultra hyped,2
whats it been like years years months and six days give or take thor never forgets,1
i really really loved the movie i wish it had taken a more serious turn because i agree with the villain s perspective and it would have been amazing to see him as a more developed character however the movie was hilarious and i ve needed a good laugh i had a really good time and i think in the end that s what matters to me,2
the part where thor said its thunder time and thundered patrick bateman really put me to tears truly a movie,2
i don t know what to say about this movie it is one of the marvel movies of all time the cgi is animated the characters are written the story is written the acting is done and overall the movie is made it is a movie it s one of the mcu movies of all time i like the part where thor said it s thundering time and then he thundered all the bad guys truly a movie,2
christian bale as gorr looks terrifying love it,0
definitivamente supero mis espectativas muy bueno excelente,2
gorr was amazing just upset the quote you are not like the other gods ive killed wasnt in the movie idk in the trailer it was just smooth af,2
this is without a doubt one of the movies of this year,2
its like watching a whole new god of thunder it doesnt feel like watching thor because hes so serious and in this he is taken to a joke,0
what do you think is the best kiss in a marvel movie,1
it doesn t matter if you are team cap or team iron man we are all unified under our hate of the unnecessary kiss between steve and sharon,1
but if we re being honest tony and pepper are the most realistic either in the kissing scence or as a relationship as a whole,1
dont forget wandavision it not only gave a background to their relationship but showed there was love between the two of them,2
lets all be real aunt may and happy are the best couple,2
wheres the kiss between quill and gamora,1
scott and hope are the best couple and theyre actually realistic but dangerously underrated,2
steve and natasha am i a joke to you,1
vision and wanda maximoff are the best mcu couple,2
we can all agree the romanogers kiss was the best,2
thor el nico en tener pel culas individuales en el mcu hasta el momento,1
me encanta c mo despu s de que thor perdiera a todos lo que amaba mam pap hermano amigos su reino el amor su cuerpo los guardianes de la galaxia han estado all con l para ayudarlo y darle una familia,1
un prop sito lo es todo fuiste el h roe que m s perdi en su evoluci n gracias thor obtendr s el descanso que mereces,2
siempre he sentido que la forma en que marvel elige a los actores ha sido perfecta quiero que chris hemsworth y benedict cumberbatch desempe en sus respectivos roles en el mcu tanto tiempo como puedan siento que nacieron para interpretar estos papeles,1
tengo una mezcla de emociones estoy feliz por verlo de nuevo y triste porque cada vez son menos los vengadores originales que quedan,1
esa canci n le llego a lo mas profundo casi a os siguiendo las aventuras del dios del trueno siento que envejecimos juntos,1
me encanta volver a escuchar a los guns roses en una pel cula ahora todo el mundo va escuchar este tema en sus play playlist y celulares aguanten los guns roses y thor,1
me duele porque este podr a ser el final de thor claro el actor dijo que a n har m s pel culas pero es triste saber que su lugar como vengador lo tomara jane espero alg n d a regrese al equipo y luche a su lado una vez m s ya sea contra galactus beyonder o en la guerra del multiverso,1
y este bello universo que seguimos hace mas de a os sigue mas vivo que nunca vamos carajo por mas del mcu,2
en serio sweet child o mine le queda perfecto al avance love guns nroses regresar ha estar de moda as como something in the way de nirvana en the batman,2
only one can do both daredevilfades from existence,1
jennifer actually saying lawyer show straight into the camera is exactly what i want to see in a shehulk series,2
i will definitely watch this show it s different and with all the chaos that ensues in the mcu it s nice to have a change of course there will still be chaos but not like some avengers level threat hopefully,2
this looks amazing they clearly are making a very entertaining show cant wait to see who else the surprise characters are that shows up,2
this is hilarious i want the show to have this exact feel to it,2
i honestly hope that beginning part with the dun dun is actually the intro for the whole series cause thats hilarious,2
as a law and order franchise fan i appreciate the beginning of this clip,2
weirdly enough this is the trailer that sold me seems like an actual breath of fresh air looking at the mcu from a new angle and if that opening joke is any indication looks like a fun show im honestly excited now,2
i died at the dun dun can t wait for this show to come out,2
super excited going to binge it when final episode comes out,2
this was a great stream it felt like the production quality had gone up a lot since the last marvel one and everyone played well i thought peter was a great addition to the stream he started a little quiet but really got into it,2
love it cant wait for this box and also the wolverine pack also cant wait to see what else you guys have in store for the xmen saga,2
we cant wait to get the box and hero packs so we can play the campaign on the channel xmen my favorite comic franchise glad to see them come to champions,2
great stream really love seeing the passion and enjoyment you all show for the game it s also obvious how much you understand the core of characters and continually being that across in your designs thanks and keep up the good work,2
great stream slims cards are subtly powerful really affected the outcome,2
love xmen hopefully they stay around a long long time this game will now be called xmen the card game as far as i m concerned and if it s not too late i d love to see quentin quire aka kid omega,2
i got to play the sabertooth scenario at gen con and we straight up got our heads kicked in,1
should we consider calebs comments on psychic rapport to be an official errata because as written when the phoenix player takes that action they would not be able to choose that option it would have to read something like return a cyclops card from the discard pile to the cyclops players hand,1
unfortunately i wasn t able to make it live but i do have a question how do you resolve shadows of the past with phoenix it seems a waste to have this restrainedunrestrained status mechanic only to have sotp say just forget all that,0
please make a nathan christopher summers aka cable xmen hero pack please,1
shrek looks great,2
she hulk im better at controlling my anger because i control my anger infinitely more than you i control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me do the writers even know bruce banner at all or do they just look at him as a man that gets angry and turns green and big because that line of dialogue was ridiculous bruce banner was abused as a kid watched his father figure beat his mom to death bruce tried to off himself and failed bruce has to live with the fact that hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in avengers absolute ridiculous writing,0
she hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics i read as a kid decent action but mostly hilarious if this is half as funny theyll have a winner,2
hulk has fought aliens monsters been sent into space been in battles taken on thanos forced into hiding had a split personality and has been hunted and attacked by the military but shehulk was sort of cat called by three guys outside a bar and her boss did some mansplaining early in the episode so her life is in her words infinitely more stressful than real hulk this show is making feminism seem more ridiculous not less also smart hulk sucks aaron american,0
im so glad i found and watched that video i miss when movies used to make sense im expecting this series to explain why the hulk is back in his human form in shang chis end credits i saved almost on my flights using mighty travels premium,2
its great to see hulk jumping again,2
love the part where she says its hulkin time truly one of the shows of the year,2
i adore tatiana shes easily one of the best actors currently working between her brilliant performances in orphan black or in s perry mason but my god this looks pretty terrible im so bummed for her because this is the first mainstream exposure shes gotten as an actor and this looks like its shaping up to be a complete trainwreck,0
when you start telling the audience how to feel about the character see super girl e you have to doubt they will succeed at showing us a compelling character,0
my favorite part was morbius is saved by shehulk in the first episode their scene celebrating in the champaign room afterward was a comedy goldmine he repays her kindness by teaching her the secret of activating full power with morbin time,2
un crossover entre dc y marvel es prematuro sin que antes dc tenga pilares s lidos y con pilares s lidos me refiero a afianzar los personajes principales personajes y no un black adam que no es un villano ni un h roe sino todo lo contrariono es uno de ellos ni tan siquiera se parece a su contrapartida del c mic,1
todav a es muy pronto para un crossover de dc vs marvel tranquiiiiiloooo dwayne no tan r pido es cierto que a muchos fans frikis nos encantar a este crossover pero para m es pronto primero que hagan muchas pelis de dc tantas como m s o menos marvel y luego ya veremos si se podr a hacer ese crossover el d a que llegue ese crossover si es que lo hacen la vamos a flipar seguro,1
la gente parece pensar que daredevil siempre es como en la etapa de frank miller que por cierto tambi n tuvo momentos de humor cuando tiene otras etapas en las que se permite ser menos serio,1
actualmente la unica manera que marvel haga pelis con dc es que las produzca marvel y se queden con el de las ganancias de la peli,1
pues estar a mejor que the rock haga un wwe vs aew ahora con esta nueva era de triple h estar a s per epico,1
me meo con el momento jessica gao eres el mejor t o,2
yo pensaba que the rock nunca saldr a en un crossover de dc porque perder a el protagonismo que el suele tener pero resulta que le gustar a un dc vs marvel lo que quiere decir que si se puede contar con el para un proyecto mas grande ser a un ca n verlo haciendo parte de la legi n del mal,1
si hay una pel cula marvel vs dc me gustar a que fuese animada,1
seg n yo lo veo en eternals marvel fue la primera en gui arle un ojo a dc para alguna probable pel cula conjunta el problema que yo veo es que evidentemente ambas compa as querr n un de participaci n y beneficios en todo y el mundo compartido de dc ni por asomo esta lo suficientemente consolidado como para que le d a dc la necesaria fuerza de negociaci n para el proyecto,1
el primer m quina de guerra o el primer actor que interpret a superboy en la serie de los,1
imagine if thats really the grandmasters ship and all of this leads to the debut of world war hulk in the mcu that would be insane,1
the cosmos determined her fate for calling steve rogers out like that,1
captain america turns chair around and sits down so you made fun of me and suffered the consequences,0
in the movie that came out in the s he was in a car crash with his wife or girlfriend i believe he was able to get himself out but he couldn t get her out which lead him on a mission to find the chemical that makes people strong in situations like that,1
honestly i was expecting one of the tires to burst and we d get the car crash that occurred at the beginning of the pilot to the original incredible hulk tv series,1
seeing those flamin hot cheetos go to waste was such a heart wrenching moment for me,0
obviously captain america was a virgin she hulks final words,1
this right here is propably the most important thing to make a show or movie like that really work on an emotional level it grounds even the most fantastic characters and stories in a way no amount of vfx can casual smalltalk that actually feels like smalltalk with all the natural imperfections she even slightly misspoke like we all do from time to time and they left that in that takes courage but it makes even this short clip so much better i respect that a lot and i am really looking forward to this show,2
oh ok so this must be some jerkwad driving like in doctor strange spaceship what the hell oo,0
ok that got me i was not expecting that i thought it would be some kind of a regular car accident but this is the mcu i guess,0
podr n decir lo que quieran de que est pel cula ser pura comedia como thor ragnarok pero de lo que no hay duda que gorr ser un villanazo definitivamente taika waititi hizo que hela fuera una muy buena villana en el ragnarok y aqu no ser la excepci n,1
se siente diferente cuando ves a thor sonre r despu s de endgame esto va a ser un pelicul n,2
menudo hype,2
no se si le tengo m s ganas a esta o a doctor strange que pasada marvel aun despu s de endgame nos segu s maravillando siempre viva marvel,2
a os desde que escuch esta canci n por primera vez ten a apenas a os y est m s viva que nunca,1
me encanta el trailer y el temazo que han elegido,1
por fin el tr iler esta pel cula ser epicaaa,2
thor guardines de la galaxia guns n roses sweet child o mine trailer epico y m s cuando vemos los ltimos segundos hasta salen las cabras de thor,1
se me sali una l grima cuando thor dice mis d as de s per h roe a terminado,1
thor el nico en tener pel culas individuales en el ucm hasta el momento,1
so far these animated projects look super interesting i hope marvel studios continues investing more animated content in the future because there are so many different ideas and possibilities that they can do with animation that would be complicated doing in liveaction there s should be variety imo,2
i am groot that beautifully poetic quote had me tearing up truly inspirational this will forever be remembered as marvel histor,2
as much as i was excited for what if and xmen but now that mature rating for marvel zombies which it should is confirmed its definitely on the top of my list of series to watch when it comes it,2
spiderman freshman year looks so promising and exciting i really wish it was mcu s spiderman,2
i am groot was truly a historic and cultural masterpiece it is one of the most poetic heartfelt stories ever told better than any shakespeare play truly one of the most historic things to happen this year,2
i m most excited for xmen from the animated shows marvel zombies sounds cool i m looking forward to the gore since it s got a tvma rating,2
these animation styles are pretty unique and beautiful cant wait to try them out,2
i love how they made groot even more cute now back to being baby groot,2
cant wait for all these marvel animated projects,2
let there be zombies that s the one i was most hype for,2
the marvels teaser,1
honestly i know this is just a recap but when the real trailer comes out i can t wait,2
ill be honest i only came because i heard that wiccan would have an appearance,1
agatha coven of chaos,1
can t wait,2
snap,1
luv luv luv mean bad witches okkkuuuuurrrrr,2
second,1
esse jogo e de ps ou n o,1
i love this fameplay,2
animasi nya keren,1
did you know that this game is disney infinity ps,1
keren seru gamenya,1
please lower the music it should be background,1
me to,2
i love capn,2
i ve got most of the characters i ve got most of the characters,1
,1
if there s a marvel moment that you re amazed didn t make our list it s surprisingly easy to tell us in the comments for more marvel click here,2
no matter how old i get seeing those portals open in endgame will always put joy in my heart,2
charlie cox s matt murdock as a surprise cameo in spiderman no way home is also priceless,2
its heartbreaking how sad strange is when he says everyone who knows and loves you we we will have no memory of you,0
the snap was awesome but finally getting to hear avengers assemble was off the chart it brought home all of the years of wait for an epic payoff thats my own number one,2
avengers endgame itself is speechless,0
i d say half the universe was speechless after infinity war,1
the last minutes of endgame was so epic but totally agree with cap wielding mjolnir it was so sad to see peter not reminding mj who he is just to keep her n ned safe and for him to be literally all alone to see everyone vanish after the snap especially peter was jaw dropping,1
we can handle your little witch proceeds to get destroyed with ease,0
when captain america was facing down thanos his entire army when all hope was lost on your left almost every hero from the mcu showed up for the final battle,1
im surprised quantumania doesnt have a single set here may be something that comes later due to the bump up but no doubt morbius is the standout,1
i personally love the marvel mech line and i think rocket raccoon will make for a super fun looking one,2
this set with morbius is gonna to be one of the lego sets ever made,2
my favorite part is when just good stepped on a lego morbius set and said its reviewing time,2
i like that lego is finally making morbius as he already had a brief appearance in the daily bugle also the rocket mech set could be groot and rocket together but well have to wait to see,2
no but i m genuinely hyped for the morbius set glad it ll be cheap too,2
if you asked me if a morbius set would sell out before the movie was announced i would say no i m excited we re getting him though want him to be in a set with spidey and blade,2
i get people are meming about morbius but he is unironcally a really interesting character and i love to see how they will design his minifig design,2
no way im in complete disbelief there is a morbius set even if it is most likely comic book based thats awesome,2
i hope its a modified version of the endgame quinjet so that way we will get the the heroes who werent in last years infinity saga in their endgame suits example black widow hawkeye roedey and maybe a more accurate version of rescue but in blue not purple,1
cant believe this year kass will have a bump and next year a new addition,2
ledger in the background jumping was so cute to me and i have no clue why y all fam is so pretty,2
yessss kass next year you will have a new baby boy or girl to dress up with your family i bet it will look so cute i hope you have a good day or night by the way i just love your costumes,2
it s gonna look amazing can t believe kass is pregnant love you all so much super excited i love halloween,2
aww ledger on the background jumping so cute i can t wait for kass to have her baby bump has an addition and you guys are soo lucky the kids going to have the best aunts uncles and grandparents i also loved watching all your reactions on kass s channel your such a cute family sending lots of love to your family and i hope kass doesn t feel sick x,2
i think it would be kinda cool if like everyone had their own colour and dressed up in only their colour or you guys could do something related to the new movie zombies,2
i think that some great halloween costumes for big family s could be greece the movie star wars toy story different prisoners people from the s ghost busters movieboygirl or sea creatures,2
you guys should dress up like your from the s or s vintage or you can be models and you won t have to dress up at all,1
omg kass is gonna have a bump it s gonna be so exiting watching you go the journey of your pregnancy wishing you the best,2
i can t believe kass is pregnant i m so happy for y all,2

book about it shrugging it off the avenger retorts you re all welcome for all not being dust voice over narration from kang the conqueror begins youre an interesting man scott lang youve lost a lot of time but time isnt what you think its not a straight line this dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device which unexpectedly turns on as it powers up it emits a bright

the guardians all walking in slow motion groot thicker and more muscular no rocket and gamora slightly off in the background marvel studios black panther wakanda forever official teaser youtube note i wasn t in hall h this is just what i was able to find online it is more than possible it got a bit messed up in the game of internet telephone i welcome corrections from those who were there,1
for every weary traveler kevin feige entrance phase four phase five shehulk attorney at law secret invasion antman and the wasp quantumania guardians of the galaxy volume phase six black panther wakanda forever ending i love this comic con,2
kevin feige is clearly more powerful than thanos or even all the avengers combined that we can all agree on,2
this has got to be the most emotional panel so far i wasn t even there to watch the full thing but i teared up about different times just by watching this,2
wow tenoch s speech in spanish hit me i m not mexican i m peruvian but i understood the message he sent out you can feel his excitement and that he s incredibly honored to not only represent the mexican community but latin america as a whole i m looking forward for namor,2
last but definitely not least for the first time on the big screen namor the submariner i feel like most people wont really understand how historic that line from coogler is also shows he really understands the depth of the character and im so happy for it,2
man i m still in awe of how far marvel has come,2
i literally lost it when the black panther artists came to perforn the cast came on stage lord mbaku lol talked about the movie each individual experience feelings of honoring this film to their late great brother chadwick to see the trailer b hand watching this panel i cried this will be epic another groundbreaking movie at box offices everywhere cant wait,2
this is my first time watching an announcement for upcoming marvel movies lmao these upcoming projects are sick asf can t wait to watch these i m most excited about the avengers movies hopefully they are as good as infinity war and end game gonna miss the original avengers though,2
that emotion after they showed the wf trailer was incredible,2
hey marvel fans check out this awesome video by our friends at cbr,2
whos here after chadwick boseman died rip,1
nobody stan lee im about to save this mans career,1
chadwick was a legend he will be remembered,2
it also helps the robert downey jr looks just like tony starks from the comic book its kinda like he was born to play the part haha,2
chadwick did more and better while dying of cancer than most actors ever will in their entire careers he was a true gentleman in every sense of the word rest in power chadwick,2
okay enough with the dudes lets give the ladies a time to shine shows one girl,1
umm so i guess everyone forget that paul rudd was on friends for like seasons,1
rdj is an amazing man to live with a disease that nearly cost him everything and not limited to his actual life to come back and be one of the best actors and humans i ve ever watched from afar as a fan change his entire life style,2
hope it helps intro robert downey jr chris patt chris evans chris hemsworth brie larson kumail nanjiani paul rudd,1
its finally here drop a like if youre hyped to see this suit in the game even if its a mod,2
this peter s model is so perfect for this suit it looks like it s actually andrews peter in the suit unlike the mcu ones,2
this is one of the best suits in spiderman history and its a welcome surprise seeing it in spiderman no way home when andrew garfield was wearing it in the movie if this suit ever makes it in spiderman remastered officially itll be just amazing seriously no pun intended,2
ill wait until they are fully finished dont get me wrong the suit looks good actually but i needed that movie looking suit with that actual texture and velvety red and blue look with those ballgy glassy eyes,2
the fact that insomniacs sound for webswinging is very similar to original tasm film makes it more awesome,2
that suit looks amazing this suit needs to be put on either spiderman remastered or spiderman,2
oh man hearing tasm theme makes me want the suit even more,2
this just gets me more excited at the thought of a tasm movie,2
andrews voice in the background music was syncing with spider man in the game hilarious and perfect,2
literally the best movie suit but i really do like tom hollands far from home suit,2
the way he was crawlin,1
tony stark be like what color is your bugatti,1
tate after he strangles you breathe air,0
the screaming when he was strangling him i literally laughed so hard,2
everytime i see one of these shorts i question every single thing that s made my life lead up to this moment still love the content,2
personally if that was me i would not let andrew tate disrespect me like that thats just me though,1
the song everytime i swear to god it s gonna be andrew tate theme song one day,1
austin is hilarious asf and hes my favorite youtuber ever,2
punches him in the stomach should ve aimed for the head,0
the sound effects gets me dead more than the meme itself,0
its good to see that my prediction all those months ago of squirrel girl being the hard counter to thanos in this game has come true,2
should have started with sl on the mystic room they go before zemo,1
i feel like nebula gamora and aw should get revives when paired with dorm since they naturally have revive as part of their kits,1
i m running into ya on defense a lot in room i play in diamond any advice i ve been using wx but it s dicey,1
black order beats weapon x the video is by morpheus,1
i m the best,2
kate bishops arrows are tech that is why she is tech,1
so how can darkhold be good in the cosmic room room dr strange should never take a turn according to the passive on the room ive seen them put in that room before but it should be like on if you dont bring any cosmic can you please confirm this,0
that score for the kang dynasty and secret wars avengers movies gave me serious chills what a time to be alive,2
years after blade saved marvel we finally get a reboot well deserved and long awaited for sure,2
the hype is not the same anymore when they announced back in the day phase with infinity war and endgame these two if you search the reactions are insane,0
the avengers have always held a special place in my heart i m glad that they re getting new movies,2
seeing the reveal for the avengers movies sent chills down my spine im absolutely stunned at what all is coming in these next phases,2
bro that was just insane i can t wait to see all of these films shows,2
man i m so glad i got to witness the mcu in my lifetime truly something special and unreal,2
even though i wasnt there i had goosebumps hearing the audiences reaction and the suspense the screen gave us,2
guys i dont think many will read but a possibility kang has the ability to travel back in time forward in time we could be seeing certain characters coming back in secret wars the comic was about two worlds colliding i believe this could mean again we see alternate versions of some characters coming back but not to stay as both earths will collapse if the merging is not stopped,1
the amount of planning really deserves appreciation being a marvel fan it gives me so much happiness after seeing the avengers titles but dont get me wrong the benchmark the marvel set with infinity war and endgame really seems unmatchable,2

yondu being talked walked off set was funniest by farlol,2
roberts laugh always makes me smile so big,2
thanks to keeps for sponsoring this video go to to get off your first order of keeps hair loss treatment,2
i think its an ultron face not an iron man mask he did cocreate ultron so it would make sense,1
the mask is from the suit ultron was using when he first appears in aou,1
my biggest question isif hulk has an incredible healing factor why does he wear glasses wouldnt that same healing factor give him perfect vision,1
i think her sneaky lawyer tactics werent to find out if he was a virgin it was to find out if hes still alive she said i knew it after banner referred to him in the present tense the whole virgin thing was probably a misdirect,0
thank you for this video you re the first person to point out that bruce has childhood trauma in his past and jen doesn t,2
i like how hulks lab setup is relative to his size when jen walks next to it the height of the counter is up to her shoulders,2
i was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like people interacting onscreen and not cgi hulk animations the montageaction in most cgi scenes i feel use so much motion blur that theyre justwellblurry there was a bit of that here but overall its becoming more naturalistic dig it eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the need to add every frame between the movements for smoothness when there isnt much smoothness at all to eye movement they did a good job with the eyes for sure this has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video but just throwing in cents,2
she actually uses her audiencedirected powers at the very beginning of the show for the first time imo when she s about to leave for her trial and then turns around and says to the audience that we probably want to know about all the hulk stuff first so you ll actually be interested in the lawyer part of the show or something along those lines,1
watching this one thing that may have been an easter egg that i only remembered from this episode was the court drawing of shehulk with the weight lifters as a teenager i had a poster by joe jusko of shehulk at muscle beach maybe the court drawing was a nod to that,1
what is the title of this movie why does the ending of the movie get abruptly cut before completion the audience can t see the message resolution,0
the movie is so lovely and now part of my collection,2
show the full movie damn dude i was really getting into it,1
so lovely love to see the next one,2
this man said he was perfect wow some people,1
im so happy lmn starting to have black movies with a sprinkling of some of the greats,2
very good movie thank you for sharing,2
so enjoyed watching this film thank you,2
beautiful family love this movie,2
this is really good,2
im glad i found this movie because it shows what we can do when we stand together as a people,2
considering that this was released in this film is scary prophetic with so many elements,1
great acting for a low budget movie but also a great message and lessons we all need to relearn as a society,2
what an amazing movie it teach us everything we need to know wellll done guys greetings from portugal,2
while this movie is very low budget and not what i thought it was gona be it makes a great point ive been slowly prepping for a while and have one hell of a bugout bag and i advise everybody do the same stock up while you can cause when the shtf its too late,2
no its not an a or even a b rate moviethe core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing to analyzing what was going on around the world at that time and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile i will not criticize their reactions too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie instead they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers ill admit that ive lived in this house years and i only know and talk to of my neighbersand theres like familys up here withen a mile mabey more folks instead of criticizing this film analyze it and see where you stand and how you can help others,0
like the chief who saw his people fighting amongst themselves and only thinking about what they want he said a a single arrow each will break however as a bundle of arrow we are strong,1
good movie lots to learn to be prepared,2
for those who think life will never get this way you best be thinking about how it very much could with all the emigrants coming in with god knows what how bad things have been bad things are going getting let this sink in your head a bit,0
back in i designed an ebola response program for the hospital i worked for it was aimed at eliminating exposure and keeping panic to a minimum lol,1
drumline full movie link,1
brings back so many memories this movie is so fkn funny lmao i wish we can go back in time was a year to be a teenager,2
i freaking adore this movie,2
wow all these deleted scenes make me feel like watching friday after next and,2
this is my favorite one out the entire franchise thank you for sharing this greatness with us,2
dont beat me in front ma kids we gon blindfold them,0
this better than the real movie,2
this just made a huge part of my day finding this movie classic,2
you coulda titled this friday after next deleted scenes and it woulda had the same if not greater effect but watching this made me understand cubes real vision for the movie and the direction he wanted it to go i see why he changed some parts but i love seeing this overall,2
i have watched this movie times and i dont remember half of these scenes i know im not getting old now,2
after an hour i have to say this is one of the best movies of the bank heist genre,2
this reminds me of when i was a lumberjack in the sahara forest i know its the sahara desert now that just shows what a good lumberjack i am,2
voc s senhores n o viu o mundo invis vel como eu vi,1
no clooney but this is a good movie,2
minutes in and thats enough for me folks im now off to watch paint dry i give this prozac out of,1
izleyecegiz,2
they shouldnt have a cut scene after the phone ring im ready for it to amp up in and im thinking of switching i like the screen composition the actors and the lack of music maybe a few more minutes edit it picks up after the flashback if the flashback was just for a second after dallas asks the pacing is actually pretty solid mack and dallas are amazing actors i love their first scene and dallas and his wife in the kitchen,2
this comment section is a fuckn joke besides that the story was amazing i love how it all played out especially since i have committed crimes back when i was a young man nothing as extreme as this movie but enough to end up in jail ive changed my life around and i never plan on going back to breaking the law when it comes to watching movies like this man do i get a rush thank you,2
its also called dark secret and i believe does not have jason statham in it either,1
evil hides where you can not find within your own heart child,1
eva looks so beautifulbut her role in this movie is envious and jealousy she didnt want the man when he acted as blind and then when she knew that he wasnt then she wanted him her evil intentions destroyed their family,0
this was a very sad movie everyone did and elecelent job another oscar winner indeed with all the beautiful greatest legendary actors and actresses,2
remember the woman who was caught and the people brought her to jesus jesus ask them which of them is there without sin let them cast the first stone when jesus ask the woman for her accusers theres none jesus tell the woman go and sin no more,1
it soo sad but interesting,0
he always wants somebody to go with him wicked old man,0

free movies on youtube availability subject to change hackers idiocracy the silence of the lambs the truman show free hidden gems on youtube sidekicks penelope troll milius primer paid already free low quality version of primer primer was removed as free just after this video was complete and uploaded it is available to rent most places you rent movies if you find the low quality version linked above to be unwatchable apologies but as i said youtube will add and remove their free movies chaotically here is the full list of free youtube movies get your universal yums box,1
you hit a soft spot with ronin i think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed the acting the dense subtext the camera angles the story progresses while revealing nothing awesome,2
penelope is actually a really great movie my roommate and i love this movie and have watched it many many times if you havent seen it you should and i have to say its a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others or if youre child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like and for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be theres a lot to learn from people of all ages watch it,2
great recommendations list darren ronin and the car chases awesome and has a great plot silence of the lambs just a superb horror agree that anthony hopkins is on his finest day with his portrayal of hannibal lecter just received my latest universal yums from czech republic today many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation take care,2
these movie reviews are always good and largely because they are honest if a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed the reviewer still tries to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc its a very democratic approach always a good job,2
i recently watched hackers again and realized that its a really good pairing with the original tron they both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary just from opposite sides of the screen great performances from a great cast in both cases they are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after al gore opened up the internet to everyone,2
one thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material in this case being the silence of the lambs by thomas harris the film respected and captured this incredible book the casting of jodi foster and anthony hopkins with jonathan demme directing made it a masterpiece some movies you sit and watch others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you,2
while i generally agree with your comments about ronin the callous disregard of collateral damage shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents was a total turnoff for me they spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion,0
i just watched post mortem on netflix last night and really liked it its from norway and has only six episodes in the series im not sure how i could describe it horror a little comedy a bit police procedural i guesssome it was just really strange and at least to me very entertaining also i watch all foreign movies with subtitles so i dont know if its dubbed or not anyway check it out,2
im sure youve seen malevolent from with florence pogue but if you havent its just a really well acted horror flick i seem to like just about everything florence pogue is in thanks for another great list as i plan to check out primer and troll both of which i never would have considered without your recommendation pls keep making as many of these lists as you can,2
the revelation behind this movie is so divine a great applause for the production of this movie,2
movie title is the black rider revelation it is an after civilization falls survival film of fairly good quality,2
wow i loved this cant wait for the next one,2
woothis movie is inspirational most especially the last part where the little girl died i really love that part and theres a great lesson there big thanks to the writer and all who put work to make this movie a success,2
this is not black adam this is black rider totally different movie with totally different actors in a totally different timeframe black rider is a goodish movie though,2
this is the movie you get when you combine mad max the postman book of eli and a low budget,1
oh bugger cant wait for the sequel,2
this is not black adam it is the black rider,1
dude the rock was good in this movie i ain t even see him,2
i like when they said you got nothing to trade are you a good fighter lol good transition,2
whos your favorite character on the bear chef,1
i know that you have other things going on but i seriously miss the regularity of your videos during the height of the pandemic you j kenji lopezalt marions kitchen nicki positano and a few others are what got me through the days weeks of quarantining alone and food shortages the fridge in your old kitchen gave me hope that i could shop and cook for good food and make it work in my ancient undersized fridge at the same time i was unemployed just before the pandemic im now employed again yay but i miss the regularityfrequency of my favorite youtube channels best wishes,1
i can t tell you enough how excited i get every time you release a new video i m actually making your infamous stew today and probably this chicken piccata recipe tomorrow,2
the video was only posted hours ago and i already got off work went to the grocery store made it and am eating it as we speak and unsurprisingly its good,2
ive been in the mood for chicken piccata for a while so this has just solidified my grocery run for this evening,2
what i like about no breading or flour is its less bits left in the pan to possibly burn i could make a nice sangwich with this and the sauce as a dip hakuna piccata,2
the editing is topnotch oh and the food looks incredible too,2
alison i absolutely love watching your videos this looks delicious definitely a recipe i ve gotta try i was looking for a really good chicken piccata recipe and here we are,2
i love you alison can t wait to make this this week and i hope it s okay to call you this but you are truly my favorite chef,2
thank you so much alison for sharing with us another of your wonderful recipes even if they are as classic as a chicken piccata i really appreciate the personal twists that you give to them your twists bring the dishes to a next level i am very sorry for the abuses microaggressions that you had to endure in your profession i had no idea what the word chef said it in that context meant but i know from my own experience how even simple wordsstatements can actually be aggressions towards other people i have felt that many times in my profession too which has nothing to do with cooking btw lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether on the contrary you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us thanks again never look at yourself through the eyes of the joyless,2
wow im so proud of lil mama she did a great job playing this role it really captures what goes on every day in the hood i cried laughed and my heart was touched i know so many ppl with similar situations and i am thankful someone is bringing it to light,2
this movie really taught me more than i already have known im a young girl trying to start a new life alone after all the trauma i strongly believe that all shall come to end this movie also got me a bit emotional too but indeed is a life teacher i enjoyed and recommend that it should display movies in different contents cos its inspirational,2
lil mama is so slept on she is full of talent,2
every movie ive ever seen lil mama in has been so interesting to watch her calling is acting its evident im rooting for her,2
omg lil momma is soooooo talented and gorgeous i hope her acting career takes off she is one of the greatest and they don t show her enough love this is pure talent and this movie is bomb asf,2
this movie has powerful messages in it this my first time watching it lil mama is a really good actress and rest in peace traci braxton,2
wow this movie was rawthe fact that she lied to majority of the people she spoke to about her kids because she was ashamed says volumes this was wayyyyy too good for free on youtube but im glad it was,2
this little girl brought tears to my eyes she s so smart lil mama is the truth all around,2
so sad i cried she looks just like my daughter i would never take her through the bullshit i went through i love this movie,2
great movie i cried at the end praying for all the young girls who may be going through something like this keep your head up better days are coming,2
this is what would happen if you gave a schizophrenic a camera and a bag of mushrooms and told them to recreate the evil dead i can feel my brain cells dying,0
this was a very strange movie im glad we didnt have to pay to see it,1
oh the horror a case of corona extra dropped on the sidewalk im gonna need therapy for at least the next yrs,0
got bored for minutes i can see its a boring one so im not going to finish it,0
i am all this twice i saw it and twice im the same,1
hai dears i am second one now,2
no story meaning less film didn t understand a thing horribly boring my ears are burning,0
weird,0
well just damn this didnt waste any time or lose my attention full action fulltime and screw the backstory youll figure it out great flick,2
next best thing to a family reunion good times,2
backwoods is a good movie ryan merriman is a a good actor,2
many thanks again popcornflix best wishes everyone,2
the intro nearly caused me to cancel this movie,0
damn they didnt waste any time they just got straight into it which is great because mating call guy was a total cream puff and needed to go,2
yeah action from the start fire,1
thank you,2
i was into this and i dont normally watch like this kept my attentionuntil the very endwhich sucks unless you have a part too many questions left unansweredi hate endings as such,0
good movie,2
i can t imagine a more perfect mission impossible movie than fallout,2
i wish uncharted was more like the mission impossible movies the mission impossible movies always seem to get it right and have a sort of uncharted feel to them,2
as long as tom cruise is running you know things are going to turn out just fine,2
samaritan looks like it could be quite a gem that teen wolf movie looks horrible dont worry darling the woman king are timestamped the wrong way around is the woman king is dont worry darling,0
mission impossible dead reckoning john wick avatar the way of water spider man across the spider verse troll puss in boots the last wish black panther wakanda forever black adam shazam fury of the gods dungeons and dragons honor among thieves samaritan teen wolf after ever happy strange world smile halloween ends prey for the devil triangle of sadness emily the menu me time the hunger games the ballad of songbirds and snakes mortal kombat legends snow blind the woman king dont worry darling the banshees of inisherin,1
jw is gonna be epic ive the feeling that its going to be one of the best action films of the decade,2
samaritan looks like the surprise of the bunch about time stallone played the old tired hero other than reprising an old hero i hope him every success,2
im sure that its neo who brought morpheus into this matrix,1
i am so hyped mi john wick spiderman across the spiderverse and avatar wotw,2
im and i shamlessly tell you im more eager to see pus in boots than i have been to see everything that came out after endgame,2

ive seen this a dozen times the opening does a great job of setting the scene of absolute loneliness in that town you feel the sadness along with some of the characters a longing for times passed a stirring for something new damn good movie,2
i first watched this with my grandfather and many times after he s gone now and this movie means even more to me now then when i was younger thank you from the bottom of my heart,2
robert duval tem meu respeito e admira o eterna,2
the best western mini series ever what a stellar cast,2
i was or so when this aired on this was the only show i can think of that had my whole family piled up together watching even my workaholic father stayed up to watch this damn that was a beautiful time in life,2
this isnt just a western its a documentary based on goodnight and loving and their trail drives but absolutely classic of classics duvall said it was his favorite film to play in,2
lonesome dove is to westerns as saving private ryan is to war movies it stands alone as the very best of the best,2

not loud enough,0
rubbish waste of time,0
great film great actors and great entertainment you dont see much quality films like this anymore,2
the finest movie ever all that you cant resist all that parents taught me all i adored all that and more,2
the film is set in jennings county indiana in jess birdwell gary cooper is a farmer and patriarch of the birdwell family whose quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing jesss wife eliza dorothy mcguire a quaker minister is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence jesss daughter mattie phyllis love wants to remain a quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer gard jordan peter mark richman a love that is against her mothers wishes jesss youngest child little jess richard eyer is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mothers pet goose causes her heartache jesss elder son josh anthony perkins is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders enoch joel fluellen a runaway slave is a laborer on their farm his children are still enslaved in the south we are introduced to the family via its youngest member little jess who is forever at war with his mothers pet goose the story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on first day sunday contrasted with the birdwells neighbor sam jordan robert middleton and other members of the nearby methodist church the mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a union officer who asks how the quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching confederate troops when confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight josh birdwell responds that it might be the case his honesty provokes the wrath of purdy a quaker elder who condemns people who dont believe as he does the film returns to its lighter tone as the quakers try to maintain their ways despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair and a new organ which jess buys over elizas opposition but one is always reminded that the confederate army is drawing closer on a business trip jess acquires a new horse from the widow hudspeth marjorie main and is finally able to defeat sam in their weekly horse race one day jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses josh believes that he must fight a conviction that threatens to destroy the family eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion hes turning his back on her but jess sees things a different way josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded meanwhile jess is reluctant to fight only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless when confederates arrive at the farm with only eliza and the younger children present the family and the farm are saved when eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen as jess finds sam jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a reb he plays possum and when the confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt he then finds josh injured and brings him home each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence,1
the goose caught my eye my brother had similar altercations with a goose when he was a toddler love the movie love the story love the musicologist and the organium applicable story for these times i thank the for this that thou hast presented,2
i gotta tell you gary cooper never lets me down another great movie,2

a few years ago i got into a classic film binge mood and tried to find as many sterling hayden movies as i could somehow this one escaped my dragnet thanks for the upload neo cinema,2
sterling hayden one of the greatest,2
if i ever witness a gunfight or a gun harpoon fight i wont be standing in the crowd behind one of those involved,0
i like the story of this classic cowboy movie the act naturally especially the spanish family,2
poor sterling hayden must have been broke as he often was in his beginning years he needed to do this film hayden did love sailing read his bio which probably was the other reason he did the film every time i saw him i heard his famous line from dr strangelove bodily fluids and i felt my essence leave my body after the physical act of love making mandrake,1
great movie magnificent worth watching had everything l d expect in a great western,2
a really good western movie,2
you have great movies i know if it s from you it will probably be a good western thank you,2
never bring a gun to a harpoon fight,0
did you enjoy watching this do you want to see more amazing auditions subscribe here,2
that first person has unbelievable control unreal sustaining that last note for that long without a single ounce of wavering was incredible,2
the first singers voice was glorious and what a lovely authentic soul i loved him,2
i really think the lady who sang the song from the greatest show man movie deserves an award she have the voice of an angel i hope and pray she will make it in the music industry best wishes,2
the first man is definitely golden buzzer what a voice,2
i have watched sarah ikumus performance of and i am telling you who knows how many times now and she blows me away every single time just spectacular,2
the girl who sang never enough was showing her true self as she sang loved it in the movie and even more this time,2
yesterday jimmy spent his time teaching online kids music remarkably he sang tomorrow not knowing that today on this vry day marks the greatest day of his life he deserves the golden buzzer,2
simon you should sing something else simon thats not my worst song anymore jimmy is amazing that voice is outstanding i dont know how he did that,2
the year old was a superstar already such an extraordinary voice thumbs up,2
immortal classics i am now and saw this classic during my teens on the big screen am still a big fan of yul brynner steve mcqueen charles bronson james coburn robert vaughn and elly wallace rest in peace my teenage heroes,2
this movie has a special place in my heart i was with my father who was dying of aids and we watched it together the night before he died the next day i remember us enjoying it together in the evening and he slipped into a coma that night and passed away the next day every time i watch this great film i remember him,2
the magnificent seven over time has come to describe the lead actors more than the movie and the most magnificent of the seven yul brynner impossible to match him,2
possibly not only the greatest film ever made but the greatest story the lesson being that material possession should never take prescendence over our common humanity a dollar bill always looks as big as a bedspread what a line,2
yul brynner steve mcqueen charles bronson james coburn robert vaughn and elly wallace one can only imagine what the production took to create such a classic all of these professionals were real actors that worked for a craft and then defined their craft particularly according to each ones caliber of understanding timeless is correct,1
i saw this movie in seventies as a teenager several times they were all so larger than life heroes there can never be another magnificent seven,2
even though the movie is a remake its one of all time greats sure some plot twists are naive and the fightingeffects dont stand to contemporary cinematography but everything else is simply brilliant starting with the original score all the way to the moral lessons the movie brings a true inspiring masterpiece,2
i first watched this movie in a cinema in s the righteousness truthfulness bravery and courage shown in the characters in the movie helped to mold my character in the later days of my youth and made me join the uniformed service to serve the public,2

who are you team vikram or team vedha,1
hrithik action deadly combination,1
it is actually so tough to even imagine the vedha character other than vijay sethupathy but hrithik is extremely talented so hoping the best to see this vedha,2
its true that no one can replace vijay sethupati vedha role but hrithik has also done justice to the role it will be the biggest blockbuster of,2
that tada dada dada da tada dada dada da gives me goosebumps this will be blockbuster,2
waiting we are kerala teams we love vikram vedha tamil movie madhav sir and vijay sethuparhi sir now waiting this combination heavy team,2
no one can replace vijay setupathy as vedha rolebut im sure hrithik has delivered his masterful performance in this movie total goosebumps with bgm,2
hrithik always amaze us with his acting skills,2
guys at least let us make this one a massive hit,1
but seriously guys believe me this movie is gonna be a super hit this year no comparision,2
hesher experimenter jcvd sweet country the virgin suicides marathon man nebraska better luck tomorrow spun the conversation bound thirteen lives visit get a year supply of vitamin d individual travel packs free with your first purchase,1
i completely agree with you about thirteen lives i watched it the other night and i wasnt sure i was going to make it to the end it was so intense and i felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it unbelievably fantastic movie,2
better luck tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films as an asianamerican i never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad that viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist in my opinion what we can only have roles as nerds straight a students martial artists dutiful sons and daughters etc this film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did sure i wasnt dealing and stealing and whatnot i was in all advanced classes and band but i also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties i felt seen by this film i may not have always agreed with ebert but i will always respect him for using his influence and voice in the industry to shoot down that nonsense at the time,1
i wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the s and s without having to pay extra for them im a big fan of classics including the likes of cary grant kate hepburn william powell etc i used to be able to watch them on youtube but theyve pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement,0
thirteen lives was incredible its exactly how we as human should be behaving,2
i really liked bound it shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie lives was good also i watched marathon man when i was too young to get into it or understand it i recently watched it on prime,2
you could not have been more spot on with thirteen lives darren what an amazing film incredible thank you as always for the recommendations,2
i always appreciate the work you put into your reviews i feel that you re very thorough and honest in your opinion thank you for what you do jcvd is an amazing movie very hidden gem,2
another killer list ive said it before but check out birdy for one of nicolas cages earliest movies and hector and the search for happiness both are terrific movies,2
lives was an excellent movie i remember hearing the situation on the news i didnt realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out drowning suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it i highly recommend this movie it was so so good great even,2

great cast and the curse words in it though karuru kev from limurukenya tis al curse words up,2
the dinosaurs wowed audiences for million years jurassic park went from brilliance to boredom in just,2
the only one that legitimately peaked my interest was that vesper one,2
the best new sciencefiction movies avatar the way of water thor love and thunder vesper prey black adam lightyear nope the hunger games the ballad of songbirds snakes rubikon crimes of the future jurassic world dominion doctor strange multiverse of madness everything everywhere all at once project gemini moonshot strange world dc league of superpets spiderman across the spiderverse the flash,1
vesper looks like miyazakis nausicaa appeared in a film of david cronenberg eg existenz or mentioned in the list crimes of the future or more probably in garlands annihilation also i must noted a strong stalenhag worlds vibe,1
im going to watch indiana jones and the batcave of spiderman when it comes out,2
wow i could really miss every single one of these and not feel id missed a single thing,2
i loved the first avatar movie thought it was amazing couldnt wait for the next movie then years went by its like your dad finally came back after he went to go get milk that one day when you were a kid and now youre an adult and he asks if you want to play catch in the yard confused surprised and filled with a decade and a half of resentment youre like yeah sure i just gotta go get some milk first,2
i mean i like how theyre going into the nuance of black adam the antiheroes in the dc and marvel universes are as numerous as the heroes and villains,2
its just the music and the visuals in avatar that gets me everytime i will definetly watch it in theatre just for the goosebumps,2
prepping for the alien enemy vesper looks like the only art here and possibly a valuable watch,1
i cried like a baby through this entire film a biblical story brought to life with such brilliant actresses and actors started watching this movie about in the morning i never have time for anything else especially movie watching but it captivated me and i decided ill watch it out and then get moving didnt even wanna move a beat until the end its worth the watch get your hearts warmed and the tissues out smiles ruth was deserving of all her flowers i fell in love with this actress since tyler introduced her in why did i get married naomi loretta divine was perfect for this roll love love this movie again watch it,2
what a god bless movie from the story to line to the characters absolutely beautiful,2
thank you for sharing this movie this was a wonderful remake of the biblical story of ruth and naomi i wish for more movies like this,2
this movie has taught and shown me so much how to have faith and trust in the lord with all my heart i will be still because the lord of host is with me in jesus name,2
very inspirationalthanks to the makers of this movie for bringing life with current actorsactresses to an old love story from the biblewell done,2
i watch this movie times in one dayomg this was beautifulthey did an awesome job acting the biblical story am glad that i watch this,2
absolutely amazing movielove itwonderful job to all the actors and actresses,2
i thought it was only me crying thru the movie great one i loved it,2
loved this movie and the actors,2
thank you for sharing this movie it was so good and entertaining again very good movie,2
a writers odyssey is very original and entertaining it has flaws but its wildly imaginative fantasy scifi pure action epic its hard to say what genre it belongs to but its certainly not the usual hollywood remake or evil a marvel creation i saw it and was pretty impressed i can actually see hollywood doing a remake on it because its story is so original and amazing,2
would be great to see a movie starring tom holland and taron egerton as a buddy team up action comedydoesnt matter if theyre cops or robbers i just think they could have some great chemistry and action potential given their athletic skill,2
as an avid fan of the original sonic games back in my childhood im pretty stoked to see the new film,2
lustereczko powiedz przecie kto jest bezpieczny w tym wiecie,2
so many of these look really good i cant wait to see them even the sonic movie its feels a long time since we have had quality movies and tv to watch i hope they are offered online soon,2
northman is my fave out of this list coming from a vikings valhalla and last kingdom fan,2
top freaking guncan t wait i just wish they had done this sooner so val could have really been a part of it glad to see homage done though,2
saw sonic on saturday even though i saw a bunch of spoilers it was really good can t wait for the third one and i m seeing doctor strange the weekend after it releases,2
top gun jurassic dr strange and the northman everything everywhere all at once was a kind mind trip loved it,2
iceman made cornell sweet cant wait to see uncharted but i was really hoping for somebody else playing the main character,2

a really magnificent movie and a awesome cast of actors i havent seen this movie in years and its just as good today as it was then,2
so good to see these two great actors in this in their aged years really good film i hadn t seen before thanks kirk douglas still rode a horse good,2
dont know how the hell i missed seeing this one loved it two of my favorite actors,2
i thoroughly enjoyed kyla pratt in this movie shes natural in a comedic role people need to recognize shes a grown woman with kids and learn to separate her from disney so she can portray more adultcontent roles i felt she tastefully did so in the scene where she was referencing eating her cake kyla go head do your thang celeste in the atl,2
i knw shes grown but i just still hear a kid,1
good movie,2

shilpa shetty was amazing in this film her typical koli accent and that bindaas attitude she rocked her role very underrated performance,2
shilpa was absolutely hilarious in this film outstanding performance lolo had the best drama but shilpa had hilarious comedy great balance,2
literally one of the best movie of bollywood how bollywood was used to be,2
taking me back to s where the movies were so aesthetically beautiful those were the days where everything was blissful,2
shilpa shettys acting was phenomenal her role had comic flair with emotional strength,2
the emotion concept and every actors performance of this movie incomparable watched it for the first time when was too young probably when i was in grad but still thrilles my soul wowwow wow hatts off to the makers but i must appreciate the performance of anil kapoor who has really expressed the immense and unlimited love and passion of a father for his son and shilpa shetty who for me has been a kind of an angel in this movieloved her performance the most,2
i cant stop crying this film is so emotional still watching dec,2
what a beautiful sad movie i really love the scene playing violin,2
these older movies really know how to pull on the heart strings damn im a sucker for emotion great acting,2
enjoy more exciting movie drama and original in one place bongo visit,2

that video was amazing im not sure if im watching a new mission impossible movie or a rerun of uncharted i was able to travel to multiple countries in a year thanks to the great deals i got with mighty travels premium,2
as the trailer started for avatar my first thought was no let the last airbender movies die peacefully then seeing it was the next james cameron avatar i was immediately relieved,2
when i saw the first avatar i commented to my wife that there was no water creatures as a former sub sailor i am really looking forward to the way of water,2
id love to see a mission impossiblejames bond cross over mover ethan and james together that would be epic,2
do you ever feel like there are so many great upcoming movies but they just disappear,0
mission impossible movies are for fans and theres a lot of us you had to be therei love movies so ill watch them all,2
cant wait to watch mission impossible,2
avatar looks incredible bullettrain looks alright brad pitt is a great comedy actor,2
and that is why mission impossible does so well in the box office great marketing and well in advance also the box office lives for movies like theirs you can just smell the popcorn while watching their commercial,2
mission impossible movies just getter by time cant wait for this one,2
johns boldness genelias innocence vidyut as an antagonist make this one a perfect watch i literally have watched force for times but the ending really breaks my heart,1
there are no words to describe my feelings right now congratulations this video is really good,2
now this is what a movie is supposed to be like john and vidyut sir just made magic on the screen with vidyut sir being a perfect villain and john sir being a perfect cop on the hunt,2

one of the better expert rates videos i ve seen as a former tanker it s cool seeing tanks getting some attention,2
love this guy roofs are not usually designed to hold ton tanks this implies that there are roofs designed to hold tanks,2
one of the best expert videos ive seen this guy is not just very knowledgeable but also a very good communicator and even an entertaining and enjoyable person i can easily imagine this guy being loved at his job,2
a small detail from that kelly s hero s scene is when the tiger tank traverses the turret the engine could be heard revving the tiger turret was was hydraulic operated which was powered by a mechanical drive from the engine increasing the engine rpm would allow for hydraulic pump to increase speed allowing the turret to traverse quicker,1
i am a member of the german army reconnaissance forces which use the sp hwagen fennek and we sometimes actually call our car the batmobile also we still very much work with auftragstaktik most likely more than any army in the world,2
unexpected chieftain is the best chieftain great guy great channel great knowledge so glad to see him on this episode,2
this was immensely enjoyable we need more with loremaster moran,2
the main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making although independent thinking was encouraged in the german army the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf the tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving he also has the ability to kill all of those shermans through their front armour at that range and can t even be sure they know his exact position essentially the commander is a tool,0
in fury it infuriated me that the german tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the shermans the tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away,0
i love how accurate his interpretation of batmans tumbler was he says it would only protect from small caliber rounds and something like a rocket propelled grenade would do serious damage that is exactly what we see destroy the tumbler in the dark knight the joker uses an rpg in an attempt to kill harvey dent and takes out the tumbler in the process,1
im trying so hard not to get too upset with most of these kids and their complete disrespect for some of these masterpieces at first glance because i know every generation goes through this stage its like an infuriating rite of passage,0
im trying not to get too annoyed with janelle and lucas but seriously don t judge classic movies if you haven t seen or just by small clips at least the other four aren t rude or saying negative things give the movies a chance because you may actually like the storyline and the messages behind these movies,1
janelle and lucas made this video an awful watch their attitude to something they ve never seen before is unbearable,0
the disrespect these kids had for pagemaster and the iron giant is crazy smh,0
balto is a legend his statue in central park proves it he raced the entire length of the last two stops on the modern ididorod without help to get medication for a pandemic that hit alaska he ran in a blizzard for hours without rest just to give kids children a chance to survive a true legend,2
it s not so much the fact that they don t know these movies that makes me mad it s the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad people worked hard to draw those films hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up,0
lucas and janelle needs an attitude check and respect,1
as always jaxon and anthony are so funny together by just being competitive jayka and danny have good chemistry too one of the reactors though was too snobbish against these classics wait till you become older and realize that some shows this decade would be considered cringe in the future too,2
i get not knowing these movies if you literally never heard of them i get not liking the quality but janelle and lucas entire personality throughout this video is let s trash everything we see and devalue every credible thing about it but theyre teens no the other teens in this video were great and open minded other teens in real life are very open minded as well these two don t pass the vibe and i wouldn t want to watch anything old with them,0
i m gen z and this is just embarrassing i knew every single one of these,0

great video as an established data scientist myself this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle however i almost never go through all of these steps in the same day you can spend whole days just cleaning data tuning models or putting things into production the work that you do can also vary by company some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization i have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested,2
it was a great overview of all the process it would be great if we get more videos on data preparation eda various methods for different scenarios,2
great video you did great explaining this that said i would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps specifically data acquisition and cleaning mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research furthermore it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found do some field work say nsf or an ffrdc gives you million dollars for it go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don t figure out until your back oh well this seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies all the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned the first two steps acquisition and cleaning are so important,2
thank you for this super interesting video i would like to ask you something which are the most important skills that a data analyst should havelearn,2
a nice capture of the top level elements thank you it easily gets convoluted and i was looking reflect on a simple overview,2
simplilearn you are amazing thanks for teaching us a big chunk of knowledge within a couple of minutes now im much interested to become data scientist,2
data science explained in such a clean and brilliant manner thank you for the awesome video,2
this is really a very clear presentation of what really goes with a data science project from the very beginning however things do not happen very easily there are a lot of challenges that you have to deal with in data cleaning alone the time that you use can be overwhelming,0
your videos are what is getting me the necessary introduction to data science thank you so much,2
thank you nicely explained where does adaptive analytics stand which doesnt require historical data,2
it was so good will you do a video on machine learning product and machine learning in production environment at last machine learning engineering and mlops,2
it was a perfect explanation thank you,2
a complete explanation with good details thanks,2
please make another more videos on machine learning also,2
which programs should a data scientist use to visualize data and which programs and languages are generally prioritized in the industry as a sociologist i want to do the same job i do in sociology in data analysis and take myself to the next level on this path which programs should i focus on,1

this is my first time in data science ive listened to thousands of lectures in my life barton poulson explains it very well in a very understandable and motivating way thank you very much to him i recommend to those who want to take this course,2
i am only hours in but i love the way you demystify what i once thought was so out of my leagueability and perhaps interest as well thank you so much,2
so far and cannot imagine how much effort these guys have put to make this this is really a beautiful attempt this is great thank you fcc,2
i have gone through the whole video and am really grateful for the time youve invested in this the vivid pictures and friendly speaking pace were truly refreshing and helped balance the ubiquity of the text cheers from abidjan,2
for me as a layman this is the best introduction in the topic ive found so far a video that i can always come back to and rely back on for a solid foundation,2
barely minutes in and can already appreciate the time and consideration put into this video thanks so much,2
great course content is informative well structured and explained clearly it is evident that barton poulson is very knowledgeable and his personality really shows through his spirit is encouraging and i thoroughly enjoyed his humour keep up the inspiring work,2
this is excellent even for people already working in related fields because it talks about many tools and concepts they may have overlooked the organization clarity and paulsons breadth of knowledge are impressive,2
so far its the best and most clearly explained video on data science ive watched so far awesome job,2
as a current college student i really appreciate the breakdown of the different roles and responsibilities for data science keep up the good work and i would love to learn more about ds,2
can we talk about the fact that he drove to the office to print off a chart and then fedex it to himself,1
these are what i watch when im depressed about my career at am,0
i wish i saw this months ago ive been trying to transition careers from physics to data science and after not having much luck despite what i thought to be very similar methods used in my former career now its becoming clear why my resume is getting nowhere ive focused on the top too much havent showcased my whole pyramid thank you bro,0
word data scientist description data scientist are people who uses data to create impact for the organization through insights product recommendation and etc where to find a data scientist you will often see data scientist in public places like bridges if there are too many people in the bridge look for the person dancing goofily thats the data scientist,1
what tools do you use we don t care most relevant comment i ve seen on a data science video great video,2
completely agree as a data scientist in telco company most of time what i needed i just sql to retrieve data tableau to make quick insight python with jupyter notebook to build model and experiment with dataset after assessing from data insight and business knowledge,1
im a college student wanting to explore this field youre been a great help id love to watch ur videos on the breakdown of the buzzwordsml ai deep learning neural networks etc btw loved the video,2
ive been interested in the term data science and what it could mean for me my hobbies and career and your video has been a brilliant introduction thank you,2
such a concise easy to understand and thorough explanation youve got there it can be understood clearly by someone like me with no prior knowledge of what data science is and what it entails great content,2
hey everyone this is max from the course thanks so much for checking it out weve got a ton of free resources over on the blog and my website at codingwithmaxcom to help those of you who are curious or want to learn more i hope this minicourse gives you a good basic insight into what the term data science exactly entails and i also hope it piques the curiosity in some of you to look into a career in data science if you want to dive right into it my full data scientist in weeks course can be found here if you have any questions please dont hesitate to let me know ill definitely hang around here and check for any questions or comments,2
awesome video thanks for putting in the effort to make this its funny i was totally uninterested in anything to do with math or statistics while i was in school but now i think this stuff is really cool being able to use data to learn from the past and guide your actions in the futurewhats not to like,2
awesome breakdown on this topic max i have my roots in physics as well and went into itconsulting a few years ago i have been looking for good introductions on this topic for me it was so much easier to follow the explanations coming from a physicist thanks for that,2
amazing amazing job nice touch with the stock photography which looks to be original learned a lot from this one keep it up,2
contents introduction statistical data types types of averages spread of data quantiles and percentiles importance of data visualization one variable graphs two variable graphs three and higher variable graphs programming,1
this introduction is really clear thank you max for your hard work well done,2
hi max this is great stuff for any beginner in data science do you have any videostips on probability and logistic regression that are easy to understand as well thanks,2
hi max very informative and interesting question at you talk about continuous data and contrast every number from infinity to infinity ie numerical infinity with every number between and however can those numbers be equally infinite as subdivisions can be infinite,2
thank you so much for this im going to college in the fall to major in public health and i was thinking of picking up a data science minor as well this is simple enough for me to understand what the field is what it requires,2
thanks for all the great work you folks do,2
do you still want to be a data scientist,1
i only wanted to become a data scientist so i could buy fancy cat pots to put my plants in,1
we need to spend less time asking people what they want to be and more time asking them what problems they want to solve what they want to build or what kind of value they would like to create,1
damn a data scientist is just someone who is really good at a lot of hard things,2
ive considered data science but for me itll come down to who wants to use the data and how a lot of businesses want to use data science to increase profits but im more interested in using data to discover things help people etc,2
instead of dealing with the discomfort of whether i made the right decision i decided to do a data science phd so i have peace of mind knowing i made the wrong decision,1
as someone who transferred from data science to data analysis i agree with every point here being in the everlasting learning process was particularly exhausting not that data analysis needs no learning but the intensity ds requires is of another level,0
ive been considering taking a master degree in data science and business analytics and i was wondering whats like being a data scientist until i found your video thanks youtube and thanks tina i have more idea now,2
i am not totally sure about whether or not i want to be a data scientist the interest towards learning has been kind of gradual for me but for now i can say that my inclination is more on the side of data cleaning data modelling and data visualisation i might probably end up somewhere close to being a data analyst cant imagine beyond that for now checked for all points that you mentioned bang on except for the last one marketing ones own work i am someone who believes strongly in my work speaking for myself rather than otherwise have been trying hard to change this mindset of mine might take a while but will get to it definitely thanks for this informative one helped me clear my mind about certain things see you on the next livestream,1
this got me so excited to be a data scientist always learning in different fields and getting to continue being a scientist it sounds great,2
the video we have been waiting on from tina,2
learn the fundamentals of maths basic knowledge of computers learn the basics of a programming language eg r or python the most important thing learn statistics its by far the biggest part of data science machine learning is statistics build little projects and try to connect something with a database dont be overhelmed of all that new technology stuff nobobdy knows everything and you dont need everything too,2
im in cyber security doing vulnerability management but this is making me want to get deeper into data science i wish youtube had more entertaining and enthusiastic creators like tina ken luke in the cybersecurity field,2
those are valuable pieces of advice i always get caught going deep but my main problem is distraction i end up learning too many things,0
this is was far more comprehensive than i expected so many other channels will throw up python and sql and will then recommend a bootcamp or moocs solid video and thank you very much,2
very well thought i agree with everything that has been said in the video i used the breadthfirst approach when i changed my career to software engineering couple years ago and yes its least painful and most effective way to learn skills for a technical industries thanks for the video im just starting with data science and this is very helpful not that you only say what to learn but also how and where,2
this was really insightful and helpful thanks for making this,2
i m currently an entry level community manager data science is so intriguing to me as it would allow me to listen to userbases and other communities so much more closely you just gave me what i need to get started learning thank you,2
i found this video to be very well done when i begin work on a new model i always start with a google search and go from there unfortunately you cant do this during an interview i feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked all the time just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper and build out a model ive been in the data science world for the past years and thats years of proven success if thats not good enough for you writing code on a blank sheet of paper wont help very much at all,2
this is very helpful thanks for putting this together,2
the biggest problem i ve had so far is working with my manager we both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right we are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in so he s an old head and i recently graduated it s very tough to get along and having your voice heard,0
im learning data science and whenever i read job descriptions for entry levels or even for interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have years of experience plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services i mean it feels like theyre demanding an intermediate data scientist and terming it as data analysis intern or junior data analyst role this frustrates me a lot,0
yes there s ambiguity in role definitions in my previous company i worked as data scientist however i hardly did any data science work it was more like a developer work where i was assigned to test and deploy the ml models in production i could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services trouble shoot real time issues but did little of ml then i changed my job and joined as data analyst here i do little of analysis sql etc and more of ml like developing models and fine tuning them cleaning the data feature engineering and feature selection i would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project they lack quality data if they do have data accessing and compiling the data is another issue after aligning with multiple departments as single man army you are expected to give some magical results when results are satisfactory you will be asked to deploy them here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing somehow you drag the project later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production and then after all of this single man army efforts management doesn t see any value in it just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution they are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it,1
i feel like tech jobs always morph we have hiring expansions and more specialities then we have layoffs and more generalizations it does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff but i ve been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills thanks for the video,2
great insight i got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so the fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for it felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees after i got a role i left after a year and transitioned into swe as like you said the expectations didn t match the reality plus i was also at a toxic workplace i realized that i want to be in a role that is more welldefined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later i m not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements,1
thanks for sharing your experiences the manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists a category i wasnt aware of before this video was odd to me so he was saying that there wasnt enough data science related work for a full time hire or else he wouldnt be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer i can imagine companies having this need smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats but if i were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist id avoid this managercompany i actually left a job in the s for this reasoni was being pulled into other jobstasks that werent related to machine learning so i left and joined a company i could do machine learning full time im an old guy i predated data science so in that time it was called data mining or pattern recognition and yes im using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though i know they arent fully interchangeable the manager is keyeven if you like the company if you dont respect or are respected by your manager it will be an awful job remember that when you are being interviewed you are also interviewing them,1
you covered some really great points that im also experiencing in my current role as a data scientist tbh i dont even know what im supposed to be doing and it makes me feel so lost especially since im still early in my career i saw great people leave the team to work as a data engineer and a software engineer its absolutely demotivating to see people leave im also looking into transitioning into a more data engineer andor product analytics role but the interview prep is super overwhelmingdifficult and imposter syndrome really kicks in,1
its really difficult to work as a data scientist because every company have different expections from data scientist and now a days a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision deep learning operational research machine learning sql and many more there must a discrete line between data scientist work roles and also as you have mentioned interview prep it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch struggle of a datascientist,0
preparing for interviews can be arduous because like you pointed out that different organisations have different definitions of a data scientist role and data science is such an extremely broad term that is often times disputed amongst people you only find out when you sit for the interviews that the organisations sometimes are actually looking for a data analyst or ml engineer or data engineer when the interview doesnt circle around what youd imagine it to be but thats the reality and thanks for pointing it out and most of the time i am just scraping and cleaning the data which definitely gives me mixed feelings about my job role i could really relate to your experiences and it definitely resonated with me such an insightful video for the ones who want to pursue their career in data science because often times it can be misinterpreted,1
in my personal experience the harsh reality also included studying all the time to the point that you personal life gets affected hours of work and hours a day of just keep up with the new lake cloud software technique library bi tool etc the feeling of you dont know enough you are not enough you briefly mention this and i am glad that i am not the only feeling the same way i know python enough to do my job but i am not a python expert who can write functions from scratch or change between languages say from python to java or r i use the existing libraries and move on to the next project,1
get off the data science program,1
amazing your way of explaining is superb thank you so much,2
i would like to have a video of how to start studying for data science i mean where to start and how to progress that would be helpful for those who dont know where and how to approach data science course congrats to the team thank you,2
very well curated,2
i dont think id ever heard of this thanks for explaining,2
data science a best place to learn data science and todays content was super the concept of learning things in mins says how this website have depth knowledge of data science i always love data science website,2
amazing please explain how data science will be useful in health care,2
hello maam sir may i request to know course of data science and data analysis which one is the best course and co urse price which education need to complete to do it course,1
very well explained can use this video in a interview,2
way of exlaination is superb,2
google data analytics certificate,1
great video shane completely nailed it as a data scientist myself i was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were on the job a lot of my peers find that they arent challenged enough by their positions this is probably because data science is still relatively new and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams the other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they arent liking the position at hand i love seeing the data and trying to map it to what im hearing anecdotally,2
i loved the remark about how ifwhen data scientists jobs get automated either the world would have ended or world peace would have been achieved,2
excellent datadriven assessment of this field i am with a bs in math just retired not really want to work in data science and pursuing a masters in statistics i have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens i was able to start on zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although i keep fit and positive i never lied about my age that would be creepy but didnt need to advertise it either so long as i pulled my weight in study groups i feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best i can you mentioned ageism and while i have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet i have experienced ageism and how ones value can diminish at a job the brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating me ill keep on going until i cannot i enjoy turning data into knowledge i am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos either way keep the data and its interpretation flowing and rage rage against the dying of the light,2
i m a data analyst i will say you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set one wrong variable can skew your results majorly which can cost time and money i ve had to bite the bullet before and it hurts wasting hours of your life on something that needs to be redone or straight abandoned,0
thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,2
my close friend got his bachelors in electrical engineering then went for his masters in data science he is now making k including bonuses at intuit as a machine learning engineer and he s only with no experience got the interview thanks to his masters then barely passed the interview by doing over leetcode questions x each,1
great video im a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position so i have some ideas on the markets for both jobs in my opinion the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed those folks oftentimes wont even get past the hr screener theres so many new data science and analytics masters programs that have opened up along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable statistics computer science economics physics etc that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview even if you have a great portfolio the hr screen is not even going to look at it however if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics masters degrees the job market becomes super easy,2
hi shane the actuary here who has commented on your channel frequently i would just like to point out that actuary is a special case of data scientist the skill sets are extremely similar and also there are many data scientists who are hired by insurance companies i havent finished watching your video yet but i already know this is a really good one whether in or out of insurance,2
shane i would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information i looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science usually people will go into something like business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs for instance in it career questions even though it may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin,2
thanks alex for all the advice i finally landed a job as a data analyst at a tech startup if anyones interested i made applications had interviews and got offers the process from starting the google course to landing a job took just under months i was unemployed and working on this full time hope that helps anyone whos looking for their next job,2
dear alex in or years from now i will look back at what i have achieved and i am pretty sure your channel will be one of the things i will be more grateful for thank you for all the important information you share here all my admiration from a venezuelan young student living in europe,2
amazing video alex cant believe im just watching this now haha im a data scientist at a larger company and i wanted to also comment that theres also the data engineer role that is becoming more hot and covers the data cleaning and dashboard creation part,2
great job on being concise in your comparisons between the two different job titles i begin my masters in data science this january i do plan to start applying to data analyst positions in the spring after i get my oracle database sql associate certification and may consider going for an aws cloud practitioner certification as well,2
hello alex i currently hold a masters in healthcare informatics i am having trouble finding a job in my field i am wondering if i should be focusing on data scientist or data analyst i don t have much experience when it comes to sql python etc i am wondering if i should consider enrolling in a data analytics boot camp what are your thoughts,0
hey alex im a medical student who would love to work as a data analyst on the side i found out there are no data analysts in the hospital i train in so ive been studying r programming since july i got an online specialization in r programming for public health from the imperial college of london and an r programming course from johns hopkins university along with other research courses ill be introducing myself to the the doctors who conduct research in my hospital in january do you have any tips for an aspiring data analyst,1
hi alex you mentioned something about learning awsazure for data analyst roles seeing that both of these cloud platforms have different coursesmodules where do you suggest we start from or is a generalist knowledge enough looking forward to your reply,2
i really like how simple your explanation about ds and da very helpful i have been thinking to trying pursuing on ds career by following boot camp and course online despite of my background as bachelor of economic did you have some insight for nonstem background to undergoes this path thank you,2
hello from italy alex as a data scientist i can say that we are more focused on deployng new models into a business process that drives direct value so the project management and the engeneering skills become really important unix professional coding sql git spark concept of testing and so on because you have to ensure that the pipeline works in every situation even when you have really bad or poor annotated data i dont think that you need a phd cause the algorithm that you use are pretty popular in the community xgboost bert resnet and so on,2
great content as usual i dont know whether you already did a video about it but do you think that data analysis is going to be saturated in the next years with all these hype about data i was wondering if the offer of data analysis is going to be higher than the demand for these jobs thank you for spreading the knowledge about data,2
reminder that all resources i mentioned are linked in the description thanks for watching everyone let me know what your goals for this year are below mine are do a project with a generative adversarial neural net enter at least kaggle competition do at least projects and share them on youtube,2
path coding python sql do projects on kaggle learn statistics learn algorithms classification regression do projects again start from interesting projects and goes towards complicated projects deep learning computer vision depends on interest projects projects projects,1
so i have decided that will be the best year of my life ive started learning python on st day of the year and up till now i have covered most of the basics and made some simple programs as well in last days so far its going good thank you for this video i wanted to ask when should i start practicing on kaggle now i study around hours daily after my job and hours on weekends,2
i used your projectbased learning approach from last years video to learn data science after months and hours of learning no online courses just individual studying i landed as job as a midlevel data scientist in financial fraud detection thank you this video is spoton especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow notobvious study habits which i found helpful i kept multiple projects open so that after i went through a topic eg feature selection i could implement it in multiple projects for each topic in my roadmap i kept a date of when i last implemented the technique in a project this helped me identify important topics which i had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten so that i could refresh my knowledgeskills,2
been waiting for this video to anyone reading this if youre looking to break into data science in i recommend subscribing to kens channel and following his advice back when covid started in i was looking to break into the field and i had no experience no projects and i didnt know where to start months after subscribing to kens channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos i got a job as a data analyst im living proof that this channel is all that you need to get started thank you ken and i cant thank you enough for the doors you have opened for me,2
lovely learning map ken and yes math is very important love your channel and your content keep it up,2
this updated video is epic your pioneering if i had to start over video had inspired so many similarly named videos in the tech youtube space certainly agree with you on the importance of coding and how that opened up several doors of opportunities in accessing power tools for the data science learning journey also thanks for the mention,2
i ve been waiting all year for this solid advice ken,2
great advice on typing out other peoples work myself as a beginner its easy to get flustered on projects as some solutionstools i have not yet been exposed to by looking up others solutionswork and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code furthermore sometimes the solutions dont work as i am using python and so i have to work out and start fishing around for the latest iteration of the modulecode and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge,2
this video is extremely accurate i have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist i am in a ms in data analytics program and feel that doesnt really provide any real direction i dont know what i dont know and that keeps me from learning what i need to know seeing the path helps thank you i would like to say i have struggled to learn r and i seem to be getting sql quickly and i think this will help my confidence getting one language down can help to learn another just from a confidence standpoint,1
hi first of all thank you very much for free courses i dont know i would be able to take benefit from this or not but i think you are doing a great job as i am chef in a hotel in uae and i am thinking if i could learn data science so that i can also explore new and better career i have no idea about computer science will i be able to get benefit from this hour course if not then can you please suggest me a learning map kindly reply,2
this was just what i needed ty for explaining exactly what they do and how,2
i love this i belong here keep it up simplilearn,2
please add timestamps it would be helpful,2
is it a brief course or a detailed one,1
also please suggest courses which are gonna help in conducting medical research data analysis,2
where can i find the companies csv file so i can follow along is it online or local,1
nice video could you please add timestamps that would be great,2
i request for the csv file for linear regression for practice,1
senior econ major i got an internship with data analysis i hope to apply for a data science internship next semester i love data science and im so glad that my major falls with most requirements this channel was one of the reasons i started pursuing data science,2
shane you should interview people on your channel that work in these fields theres a pretty big community on youtube of data scientist you can talk to people in all type of careers honestly theres insight they can bring that you only get by working in the field,2
im trying to curve my career into the tech field after struggling for a few years with a worthless bachelors i have some healthcare and stat software spss experience but no codingdata analysis experience would it be possible for me to get started in this field and what are some job keywords and skills that i should look for,1
well explained topic thanks data rules the world and for businesses of all sizes it s vital to effectively collect store and analyze the data to stay ahead of the competition,2
hey shane a bit off topic but i wanna ask a question my dream career is mis but in the universities that are presented to me bachelor degrees in mis arent offered there are only masters in mis so my question is what bachelor should i get to master in mis help would be appreciated,1
can you do a registered nurse overview with this new video format i think it d many people with a more concentration inspection into the job,1
i love seeing these videos from your channel pop up on my notifications you should do a poll on youtube to see what career we want to see next,2
please do a video on the importance of top ranked universities in real world,2
sweet i would also be interested in business intelligence jobs,2
i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,2
personally i think you hit one key point the importance of domain experts with the socalled automation or new technology tools well likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs just because someones knows sql or do coding doesnt mean heshe can do data science or machine learning or more importantly to put out anything meaningful or even useful just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of highskill tools say photoshop really well to even modify a picture or video these days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to instagram or tiktok did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct no but it does mean that you need to be really good to be able to survive as a graphic designer i see the same future for data science field too maybe not tomorrow but the trend is coming for sure if you pay attention to some of the podcasts like me myself and ai most the guests chief data scientists or boss of ds departments arent really of these backgrounds but more business driven,1
the automation part was a matter of time since a lot of the work with the data is repetitive the understanding of the business and its needs have always been the most important part of data science,1
working as a phd in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data and it always shocks me how little they know id say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem my understanding are the best skills to have are be able to identify problems be able to decide how to solve the problem once that is done usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial though potentially data cleaning is time consuming but honestly dont trust me i had to go do a phd because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff,0
thats the point for example i work as bi analyst normally with power bi sql and lowcode platform powerapps automate i have a master in data science and i know how to built neural networks from scratch butfor what built a single linear regression model requieres a lot of steps and technologies azure python cloud apis devopsa lot of investment and maintenance instead most of the tools which i work on have integrated machine learning tools as image recognition nlp classification with a few steps and a clear suscription in fact i get my job because they demand for a person who knows analytics and have data science knwoladge so that can advice on the use of these integrated tools no more import keras modelfit you will be requiered to matinenance and advice about machine learnings integrated tools,1
prospective data scientists should focus on projects that demonstrate the ability to understand business context this this is very important,2
asking if data science is dying would be like asking if engineering or medicine is dying there will always be a huge demand for these sorts of careers tons of people thinking they want to do them is a byproduct of that but just like engineering and medicine most people who think they want to be in the field cant really hack it for whatever reason if you are someone who is smart and hard working you dont have to worry about the field being saturated most of that saturation is from people who arent very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two theres a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world the wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly,1
the whole data science industry is booming from analyst to engineers to scientist and you will see domain experts leading this field more and more,2
what a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science it is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that ds is actually evolving and diverse it is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health business banking etc in respect to the application of ds in it thanks a lot thu vu for your resourceful info,2
data science is extremely saturated at entry level just ask anybody whos applied for a data science job in the last year moreover data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost if you actually want to work on ai projects these days and not just be a data analyst youll need a phd in computer science also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering as data science tools continue to be democratized and automated software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part,1
this video was soooo informative and encouraging i m a neuroscience major looking to enter data science after college and have been trying to focus my skills in learning r data visualization and statistical analysis class of,2
not you being a literal life saver im graduating early and i had no clue what i could do with my applied mathematics degree without going to grad school and the way you describe this the constant learning the work environment honestly makes this sound like the job for me thank you,2
i so needed this video today i just finished my masters in data analytics and as someone who has always despised job hunting i was getting disenfranchised but you have put the fire back in my belly all of the great things you said about the career are all the reasons i started the masters so thank you for reminding me,2
hey awesome vid i was a data analyst before i had a maternity leave and i wanted so much to become a data scientist because i think its a logical progression of my work challenge path unfortunately currently i have different plans for my life but i wanted to say that you made me come back to my prev plans and inspired me again on the topic,2
great video im quite interested in pursuing a career in data science in the future and im wondering if youve got any tipstricks for someone whos somewhat got his basics down looking forward to more of your videos,2
i have a very similar background to you i am a former physics undergraduate that did research in high energy physics simulations and that computational background really helped me transition into my current data science position for any physicsmath undergrads you have the skill set to get into this field the only obstacle is being able to express your math knowledge through code if you can learn enough code to do that youre golden,2
thank you for this video currently applying for a masters in data science and this is great anecdotal support,2
very informative video i agree with many of your points and id like to add some of my own im a lead data scientist at an american unicorn we dont really care about your background as long as you can code sql and python understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ml models your education might limit your progress later on but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entrylevel data scientist communication is really important we expect all new hires to be good on the technical side so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high and lowlevel is how well you can understand whats being requested and whats important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business this is the number thing i mention to my reports during s many data science courses bas or masters dont teach sql or if they do its just basic stuff regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be sql will always be essential,2
super informative thank you for all the info i just switched majors from cs to it and thinking of pursuing a masters degree in data science do you think that the masters degree would make of a difference early on and for entry level roles salary wise overall im just kind of trying to figure out where to go from here haha,2
thank you so much for the insight on data science as a new path i have degree on agriculture and now im just starting on takin course professional certification and etc in data science im more interested into this stuff than my main degree tbh lol mainly just to get into ds job and also getting new skill to go along with my main degree seems pretty nice addition,2
thank you for this course sir it was a great hour journey coming from non cs background i had little to no knowledge about all this stuff but this video has given me enormous amount of confidence that i can program and explore data science further thanks again,2
where is the data set csv file could you please upload that one also in you github repo,1
thanks for the course i m playing this at x speed and it s perfectly understandable and saves a couple of hours of reproduction,2
thank you for doing such a good service to the community by bringing such amazing quality content for free i cant tell you how much i appreciate it lots of love and respect to the team,2
you guys are loooooove may allah bless you fulfill your wishes,2
introduction to the course and outline the basics of programming why python how to install anaconda and python how to launch a jupyter notebook how to code in the ipython shell variables and operators in python booleans and comparisons in python other useful python functions control flow in python functions in python modules in python strings in python other important python data structures lists tuples sets and dictionaries the numpy python data science library the pandas python data science python library the matplotlib python data science library example project a covid trend analysis data analysis tool built with python libraries,1
this course came at the right time gezz i needed to go back to the old drawing board because my python skills were not yet good enough to work on machine learning models haha,2
thanks for this wonderful lecture video on ds with python for beginners i and going through it learning form it and loving it ive one doubt though when i am trying to write a multiline string the output is not exactly in multiline its in the following way this is line n this is line n this is last and final line line please assist,2
he says l is the second value in the list doesnt the list start at meaning the second value in the list should be l,1
you could sent the link for the ppt which you are showing in video i want use that as quick reference,1
thanks for watching everyone i hope you have a better understanding of what it is like to be a professional data scientist sign up or learn more about sharpestminds here again sharpestminds is a data science mentorship marketplace that only gets paid when you land a job,2
that s a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist this video came at the right moment as i transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video as mentioned in the later part of the video i also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a doubleedged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation papaya tracker sounds like an interesting personal project,2
im years old and i just started my data science journey by starting college this semester been an aircraft mechanic for my entire adult life and been looking for a change for years now and you inspired me to finally pursue data science thank you ken ill be tuning into your channel just to keep my ear to the ground in this exciting field also not sure if you spoke on this before but what laptop do you recommend for data science thanks buddy and keep up the good work,2
miss the times when data science was simply called statistics now every company wants a data scientist that can do business management presentations data fetching and collection research model building and deployment model performance evaluation cloud environments database administration pipeline building and management client management with statistician the responsibilities where quite clear because now every person that works on anything related to data is now a data scientist,1
this actually answered a couple of questions i had about working professionally i know that sw engineers typically work in an agile framework but wasnt sure if data science followed that same trend thanks ken now to watch this more times so we can beat forrest,2
one of the most important things that i wish more people would do is documentation of datasets sources code rationale etc i often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different datasets how things are collected what features are used distributions etc,2
i m and i have one year left in my data science curriculum plus my master s program currently learning mysql and i m trying to learn python and r on the side it s really tough since i m in a data structures course using java and that takes up a good bit of my time hopefully it all works out for the best also trying to get a good grasp on machine learning and deep learning principles as i go and making sure i m sharp with my statistics and linear algebra skills,2
im working as an associate data scientists at a startup and i honestly havent needed to code for like months theyve got me focused on an elearning initiative,2
if you want a role where you want to work only with ai and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ml and analyze data go for a data scientist job working as a ml engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code so its more se from one side you use python for model development and cjava for production the role is building ai products so you are all day reviewing extracting and preprocessing data to then training ml models evaluate them and match required kpis in the other hand data scientists positions offer what is described in the video statistics and data preparation engineering and classic ml there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have for example in ml engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes i have been in both my background is in statistics and i have been working as ml engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last years personally i can say ml engineering is more fun even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy ai methods,1
thank you for posting this video this past year i migrated to a new work role and am listed by my employer as a data scientist this video confirmed my understanding and also cleared up confusion as many people my employer and consumers of our products have different views of a data science work role,2
as a data scientist myself i agree that anyone can become a data scientist it definitely takes a significant amount of time and effort though i have multiple videos about how to get into the field on my channel for those who are interested,2
as a data scientist i would agree with the fact that we are lazy people that want maximum results with minimum effort and think we can solve any problem given enough data d,2
anyone can be a data scientist thats the gist of this lecturewhat it requires is a combo of math stats n computer science skills topped u with communication and management soft skillsdata is the new thing from which physicists engineers social scientists can draw n infer conclusions based on past history or some kind of logicand this is the best time ever for fast processing of loads of dataright time to be data scientist you can work in any domain good introductory talk,2
this was very precise and at the same time a very broad view at this field thank you sir,2
thanks mrasitang mishra you have motivated me more to pursue data science,2
inspiring transparent talk,2
soooo good i love it and mr mishras smart humor very good overview with some fun laughs in it too,2
felt proud watching being a data scientist i can relate what speaker said problem solving is the essence,2
thanks a lot mrasitang mishra youve convinced me to study ds more,2
this talk was really the best of its kind,2
i dont agree with any of this the only way to get a data science job is to first get a job as a janitor at an esteemed university start looking for math problems on chalk boards solve them become a professor solve math wait this is the plot from good will hunting nevermind in hindsight this is really great advice how about them apples,2
great video tina loving the minimize input maximize output mimo series my step into the world of data was from a nontechnical biology background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts i also resonated with your prior mimo video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects i also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem that helps to make a positive impact in this video which at the time was a novel thing i repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it topics that i used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in your persistence through swe roles is very inspirational,2
hey tina thank you so much for always sharing wonderful tips it is almost approaching a year since i had finished my bachelors and still without a job i really hope i can break the barrier and get my foot in the industry having zero experience makes everything harder apart from doing some projects i will definitely try to contribute in open source projects or pick up a consulting assignment,2
im a ocean sciences bsc and now im starting another degree in information systems your channel is motivating me to follow the data science path keep up the awesome work,2
amazing how much effort so many people put into to getting a job while someone with connection can bypass it all and get the job,2
hi tina this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact super useful for data science people but i feel like its relevant to every field too please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection im job hunting in a field thats very new to me not data science at the moment and im just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream also even if it doesnt the feeling just sucks lol,0
hi tina do you think doing only analysis is good for your resume for example imagine that i scrape data from glassdoor and i do a analysis on the salaries of data scientists in the us after finishing the analysis on the data i got some pretty cool insights but i didnt use machine learning in the end project so is a project like that good for my resume im a major in data science and your videos help a lot,2
honestly the frustrating thing for me at work as data analystscientist is i never saw our clients give any feedback about how our reports were helpful for them and change their projects aka business impact like what you described i always comfort myself that even just a little impact and thats enough,0
hi tina you make me want to make my first comment on youtube your videos are super helpful and please keep making more interesting and insightful videos i am actually thinking of transitioning to data science from a business background and you gave me a lot of useful tips that solves my confusion,2
hmmm im going the applied math route with stats as a minor or possibly masters is there any reason in particular that you would recommend compsci beyond just the programming background it provides also how different is data science compared to machine learning they sound almost like the same thing given their job descriptions great video btw,2
glad we needed a scientist to tell us that you get rich by starting a business with a competitive advantage,2
i feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop my two sisters worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses my sisters lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state she then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times,0
so as a technician i worked at a dealership two actually owned by the same guy he has like different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy like he owns all of this property north of a major highway and is literally like a king in these lands to be honest he also seems like a pretty nice guy,2
since i was little i knew i d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a increase every year just sounds insane to me i studied software engineering so i could build my own tools and sell them took countless hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries i m interested in entrepreneurship is the way made my first m at currently,0
tldr own something try to make it a monopoly either legally or physically eg tie it your personality,1
this actually makes a lot of sense the company i work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealershipracing team owner the owner of the company isn t a billionaire but is in a position where he can throw around money whenever he wants that kind of path seems much more attainable than hoping you land a one in a million chance on a startup business or some bitcoin related gamble,1
im a mortgage broker hes completely right except the local monopoly thing can be done with a really good book of business sure you can compete but you cant steal my referrals which supply all the business offering a lower price is a poor tactic unless its purely how to learn how to run the business,1
depends also on what you define as rich i dont mean that in a philosophical way either just that living standards vary greatly from person to person if you need to have a mansion a yacht and or super cars then its a much greater challenge also what are the time horizons is your goal to be rich before you turn or can you wait until or because something else they didnt mention in the video is investment compounding interest passive income etc,1
being a trade professional such as plumbing or hvac can be very lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years if you can become the name that people automatically think of for hvac problems you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you you can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire with a tech school diploma you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service,2
remember he s a data scientist he s probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as that s what we love doing especially with public data that s nice to play with so the advice he s giving probably tends to bounce towards what s most probable not what will definitely make you rich in most ways probability can you take you a long way,2
register and and get free certificate for the course topics covered introduction statistics vs machine learning types of statistics descriptive prescriptive and predictive types of data correlation covariance introduction to probability conditional probability with baye s theorem binomial distribution poisson distribution,1
wow what a great course with an awesome professor he goes way beyond teaching the mechanics of statistics but makes distinctions and asks thought provoking questions that really help you crystallize in your head what you are trying to do,2
absolutely the best video on statistics that i have found on youtube and ive viewed several such videos i like that the professor explains a topic from many angles has charisma patience with class questions and includes many realworld examples its the perfect blend of theory and applied statistics,2
as practicing design engineer in west cost medical industry i find professor dr sarkar way of explaining the most complex subject in a practical approach very rewarding and helps in right metal representation for long term understanding although i have taken similar courses in stanford paying close to k plus usd came out even more confused and even gave up statistical approach thanks for sharing for free and hope this benefits the transition from excel based modeling to python and would highly recommend to any one working with data and design,2
thanks a lot for putting up such great content the instructor took a very practical approach to ds rather than just theories,2
wonderful content and presentation i feel like i missed drsarkar sir all these days thanks to greatlearning team for these lectures it will be great if a video is made up on time series analysis also thanks team for all your effort and introduce to us the great professor drsarkar sir,2
he is really a great professor i have been studying statistics since school and then using years for my profession however the way he teach and explain from one chapter to another chapter and subject is super thanks,2
i am greatly impressed with this lecture so simplified with imaginable analogies thank you so much sir and the greatlearning team,2
fantastic course for those who have a fear factor of stats and probability this course will certainly will help allay those fears dr sarkar focused on concepts with perfect analogies which helps understand the subject better thank you dr sarkar,2
this was really the best course i did learned alot and earned the certificate of completion as wellthank you so much great learning for this beautiful content and drabhinanda sarkar sir is the best is explaining thingsthank you very much greatlearning,2
it becomes over whelming to see the job requirements for a data science role in india its hard not to fall in the trap of not knowing a lot of stuff even having a strong foundation in python probability and statistics also ive taken a few courses from you guys till th of april and they were awesome but would you also recommend us some of the projects we can have in our portfolio which will help us stand out,2
great videos and great data science courses i used the free preview option and i am happy to learn data science and machine learning thanks so much for this opportunity,2
this was a very nice and informative video hopefully i can get a data scientistanalyst position with only a bachelors degree but i should consider graduate programs in my area thanks,2
your courses are amazing thank you for bringing us this opportunity data science team,2
hello i have a question related to your area of studies chart if i study a degree in computer science and then i study a data science master in your area of studies chart i would be on computer science on data science and analysis or in both this doesnt much sense i think thanks a lot i enjoy your videos,2
the introductory course that you offer in tableau is awesome,2
the way you conduct lessons are awesome,2
dont become a data scientist for the money do it for the people and your passion,1
i am always waiting to see your new videos the premiere option is great choice to do,2
ohmygod that was such a great video and exactly what i was looking for i am about to start a data science masters next year and was looking for an overview on how to best prepare for it and you gave me that and so much more even combined with such a great presentation how is your channel that small please continue what you are doing you are awesome,2
thank you for this ive been searching for this breakdown for a long time clear concise and to the point,2
such an amazing vibe thanks for the really cool videos been looking into data science post studies in industrial engineering your channel has beereally informative thanks you,2
hello ive been watching this youtube channel a lot and found it really helpful if you dont mind me asking a simple question is it quite common to solve normal algorithm coding test the one that for swe for usual for a ds interview thank you,2
a question ive been asking myself for years never went to college but crushed ap stat and calc in high school years ago lol have been interested to see what to expect in brushing the dust off this knowledge,2
killer video i think one area that is always overlooked in a predictive field like data science is causality its a really important area in order to understand how confounding can impact model power really digging your videos by the way,2
such an amazing vibe thanks for the really cool videos been looking into data science post studies in industrial engineering your channel has been really informative thanks,2
great video theres just so much to unpack when it comes to data science,2
i am officially on a quest to watch all your videos you are great btw what would you recommend for someone pivoting into the field with no experience,2
finished the video it feels like a game changer in terms of perspective to me plus its so informative and you can be so funny thank you,2
please share you email id in the comment section if you need the datasets and codes shown in this video for edureka data science masters certification curriculum visit our website,1
very helpful content for beginnersneatly explainedrefreshed topics which i learnt with good examples,2
thank you so much you people are always on top of expectations,2
you guys are just awesome your learning technique is too goodkeep it up and thank you so much to all edureka team,2
sir for learning data science from this video are there any prerequisites,1
well explained pls share some more deep details on what specific knowledge on mathematics and statistics are needed if you have them with you pls share the link,1
u guys r just awesome keep it up the vedios aroused my interest in data science,2
one of the best youtube channel for data science which explained every concepts deeply,2
thank you so much for this content it changed my life and turned me into completely different person i tell about what i do in terms of artificial intelligence cyberspace software development drones and lifestyle on my channel i would highly appreciate your feedback,2
hi sir i am having years of experience in infrastructure management now i want to switch to data science field no prior programming experience is it ok for switch which technology to learn i want to switch in management role,1
i try to respond to all dms on instagram twitter,1
my dude humbled by the shoutout i disagree though your videos are the ones that are on a whole other level,2
don t quit is definitely one of the biggest pieces of advice for people wanting to break into the field took me a year and a half of that horrible trial and error learning quitting starting again and networking to finally land my da role and i don t regret a second of that journey,2
the difference between a senior and junior data analyst how well you re able to formulate your question on stack overflow perhaps i should make a video about this,1
amazing content stefan i m currently a student at a university in florida majoring in business analytics and information systems which yeah basically trained you to become a data analyst i m a senior now but i feel like i learned shit in the last years despite getting all a and paying tons of money i learned from your videos way more than in the college classroom,2
considering i am extremely broke this was massively helpful bc you recommended free ways to learn various things and i desperately need that i also need to know what skills will be most useful to hiring managers and recruiters and how to effectively prove it in my cv so that was also very appreciated the very structured approach to this video was extremely helpful thank you very much,2
i cannot tell you how much i appreciate this video nowhere else ive seen someone telling it like it is in such a concise way thank you subscribed to lukes channel following your recommendation as i also see data analysis as a stepping stone,2
i needed to hear this i am starting the journey of becoming a data analyst at thank you so much,2
excellent video ive seen tons of this starting videos and you actually gave practical and specific tips to start thank you,2
thanks a ton brother that was really resourceful and the exact advice i was looking for also if you could suggest any useful certifications to consider that would add up well in the profile that would be great thanks again,2
its so important that people like you come up with such good content in order to teach folks that data science is not just about programming language and applying random ml libraries to get efficiency like you said math and stat is always the key and everyone should start with that even though we dont often use it in real world scenario in companies,2
this video was helpful im currently a ux researcher and have my feet in both qualitative and quantitative research where the quantitative requires a lot of data analysis i enjoy diving into data but wasnt sure which route i should take for my particular job to build out more of a niche in a quant ux researcher role now i feel like i know more of what i want to dive into further and want to focus more on the data analysis route,2
on the book it is a great resource to start with and it also has coding exercises which helps a lot with practicing stats and coding,2
hi maam sincerely thank you for sharing such a valuable information especially for me as i have been just wandering on yt and other mediums to just get started i want to remember this day and this video down the lane when i figure out where i belong in the venn diagram and achieve it thank you for pointing out a much efficient approach and direction truly sharat,2
thank you so much i was literally feeling lost to figure out what should i learn first python r sql now i got hope thank you so much for your videos,2
i absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and i loveownhave read the same book cover to cover there is now a nd edition with python implementation btw reason i am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions i recently went through google data scientist interview hour tech screen and to my surprise the question was straight out coin flip probability and expectation problem i was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and i couldnt come up with the answer very easily at first that was the only question some resume related question before that of course i got in the session as a data scientist myself those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally i dont think itd help to measure ones understanding of stats or technical background how would you suggest prepare those,2
thank you for such an informative video appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many im working as a software engineer but dont think im good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles and these thoughts are really tiring when u end up in too many options and not able to conclude i am with bsc maths and msc computers background and in thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in it but unfortunately couldnt find so much that timenow when i hear on data scene i feel i lost so much opportunity but i would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring is it okay for a person with almost years gap from bsc maths to start on data science now please reply,2
thanks for sharing your experience in transitioning to data scientist role some of your suggestion is good which is actually what im doing so far watching different you tube video on on same topic because as you pointed out different people has their own way of interpretation of the subject and is more simplified until you fully grasp the subject please keep sharing your knowledge,2
valuable content and glad to see someone pointing out a book they read because its not easy to pick a good book as theres many of them thank you for sharing,2
hey sundas great video thanks for sharing your tips i have one suggestionrequest on a topic you should do i video on paths of carrer progression in data scienceanalytics this will be helpful for people like me who have already spent a year or two in data science field to understand what are the directions you can take to progress in this field,2
what a journey hard work always pays off thanks for sharing and motivating us all,2
awesome video i completed years of medical school but had to withdraw due to my poor physical health chronic pain computer science was my backup if i was unable to get into medical school im currently learning python through udemys online course the tech world is so broad and i feel overwhelmed im hopeful that things will workout for me in the end but med school debt is no joke,2
i ve been been watching all of your videos while stressing about midterms currently still in my undergrad and i m looking for a bit of advice currently i m planning on majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics would a data analytics or information systems degree from the business school be better or should i stick with the more technical with cs with the stats minor looking at data science jobs nearly all of them i see require a masters degree or phd which i definitely don t have the money for i see plenty of data analyst and data engineer jobs that are open to the bachelor degree level candidates is making a transition from one of those two rolls into data science relativity easy,1
great video thanks for sharing all of your experiences how difficult was it to be proficient in spark it s such a different mindset,2
thank you for a lovely video i must admit that what you said really helped me reevaluate some things about how i have been handling my own situation thank you in fact i like the video so much that i clicked the like button seventeen times,2
love your videos i would love for you to talk more about your experience with working at a startup,2
thank you very much for sharing your educational background with us exciting as ever,2
perfect time for me to find your channel as i will begin pursuing an ms data science degree at vanderbilt in the fall looking forward to more great content from you,2
the wait is over glad to see you back on the youtubes,2
very informative i ve got an engineering degree and had courses like probability statistics linear algebra integral and differential calculus i have a letter of acceptance from a community college in canada for business and advanced analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python sql machine learning etc i m studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my winter intake will brush up my knowledge on statistics linear algebra and calculus by august as this is a requirement by the program back in the days i had the opportunity to represent our school in math competitions what surprises me is that i can still study for straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as i now leave my managers to decide on their own what do you think are the chances of people in their mid s getting a job without experience as a data analyst or data scientist,2
do you resonate more with software engineering or data science let me know in the comments below,1
software engineering vs data scientist building vs discovering clearlydefined vs interdisciplinary welldefined career progression vs flexibility coding as passion vs coding as a skill lower vs higher entrance barriers,1
this helped me realise that i am more interested in building things rather than discovering them what a great and informative video thank you tina,2
i have a masters of data science but once i started working in a data position i have realized that i enjoy more of the coding and building whether its writing python sql or r code for building and analyzing data or building reports in ssrs those are the aspects of my job that i most enjoy i have been considering changing careers to software engineering also i do feel like data scientists are expected to know too much these days from communication data visualization statistics and deep learning to cloud platforms spark and now docker that is a ton of skill and knowledge that seems superhuman,2
you are the chill girl in every class who says she hasnt studied for exam but tops the whole college,1
great explanation building products vs discovering insights,2
as someone who is working in the data analytics side i wholeheartedly agree with this data science is a new field which basically supports or optimizes how to do business software engineering leans more on building software or applications where normal people can useconsume if you want to create your own business in the tech industry software engineering should be necessary if you want to support existing businesses data science is the way im planning to create my own business on the food industry and i can see that data science can help it a lot,2
thanks for the informative video just a caveat on the salary comparison data science often requires graduatelevel education masters or phdconsiders it an asset whereas software engineers do not or if without a graduate degree its not uncommon to work as a data analyst for years before becoming a data scientist so while the average salary may be higher for data scientists theres likely some additional educationwork experience factored in,2
this is the most systematic and detailed review of any of the two careers i ve ever seen thanks for this video it definitely helped in finding my next step,2
this helped me soo much i was really on the fence but im leaning towards software development just because i have serious doubts that i could present the data in a parsableusable way i like coding so ill stick with that but i also love working with numbers so im hoping i can land a data analyst job somewhere down the line thanks for providing the insight,2
this is the video everyone should watch when starting to learn data science so many great lessons in this thu,2
a great tour de force video thu many thanks for putting this together so much great information will be taking notes on my nd and rd viewings keep up the good work,2
this is just excellent bravo for packaging so much information and insights in such short time and positive energy thank you thu,2
excellent video i love how you presented the contentits packed full of information and you get straight to the point with interesting graphics theres lots of value add in this min video great work putting this together subbed,2
great tips thanks for sharing really resonated with knowing what to learn and keeping the momentum even if its minutes,2
watching your videos gives me inspiration to keep going and avoid total burnout i let go software engineering bootcamp for data science hence your videos also contribute to my productive day and my mental health,2
hi thu you are amazingggg i was just looking for a video like this and you uploaded it cannot thank you enough your videos so informative so focused directionally and full of personal experiences and could not find any other person sharing such information thank you for sharing all of this,2
dear thu thank you for sharing your guidence as being an aspiring data scientist it would be a lot of confusion on path what to learn and what not to your video covers it well i find it is a good guidence to me thanks,2
thank you so muchh for your great sharing its really useful for me since i just started learning data analysis for my career change really love the content,2
i think to move faster u have to make your basics strong python ds ml concepts sql concepts etc some error can be solved if the basics is clear,2
im so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning i appreciate your clear teaching style,2
words are not enough to appreciate what you present in your channel i do believe you are number one in programming,2
for info at to avoid userwarning x does not have valid feature names we need to train the model with the values of inputdataset ie use xvalues instead of x in modelfitxvalues y joblib is now a seperate py package we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearnexternals anyway thanks mosh for another great tutorial,2
finally i found something practical rather than theoretical thank you sir,2
mister mosh thank you for all of the easy to follow tutorials that you make for us please keep keep up the good work i hope you post more courses preferably in python,2
im so glad i stumbled upon this you are amazing this was very pleasant and easy to follow i learned a ton and i especially like that you took us through your thought process while examining the music data set too thank you very much subscribed,2
you are the reason why i started programming ill never forget the things youve done to help me,2
thank you so much very clear and neat explanation i hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all i think,2
amazing tutorial you explained everything so clearly and helped me to grasp some of the topics even better,2
hey mosh your contents and teaching style are straightforward and easy to follow it would be great help if you do some tutorials based on medical imaging ctmri data i am having difficulties in dealing with those thank you,2
thanks for watching everyone let me know if you think data science is on the rise or decline below,2
the data science king has spoken data science is not dying very much agree with this ken i also will add that i feel there is going to be a stronger need for data engineering as we go into the future,2
as someone whos a relatively new data scientist thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that i needed ken,2
mathematics never dies programming languages are rising and decline but calculus matrices and numerics will exists until the known universe ends,1
great insights ken i certainly agree that data sciences decline is far from sight in the life science domain the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and theres a whole new frontier of possibilities,2
the sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist rejection and unclear expectations most companies have no idea how to find and sort datascientists may make many believe that is was just a fad and they came a little late to the party,0
as a student in data science in order to automate those tasks ai needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off,1
great insights as always ken the data science umbrella is so large that several titles will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems,2
just recently started my first role as a data analystconsultant for a property consultancy people in other teams and companies have told me about the struggle they are having finding data analysts im from the uk so this may of course differ where you are living but its clear new companies are realising how imporant data is,1
data science is definitely not dying and for the fact its only scaling much bigger companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts,2
currently building up skills to eventually try and become a data analyst enjoyed the dope content should def do some more,2
justin not only great editng but loved how you shared the life of a data analyst looking forward to more content from you,2
this is so easy to understand and inspiring to see data analysts daily life thank you for making such a useful video,2
omg this is awesome this the only real day in a life ive ever seen usually its just some blog eating fancy food and going to the gym never telling exactly what they do but this guy did it correctly congrats,2
this was so much fun to watch and immensely encouraging for me to continue my studies,2
awesome video are there any other tech skills being applied to your typical workday outside of sql perhaps excel python etc,2
i love this and even the food vlog portion im a recruiter so its interesting to see what its like in the roles i commonly get to work on thanks for the great experience and video,2
what an awesome video thank you for sharing it for someone that wants to become a da as a career what kind of courses or learnings would you suggest they take in the beginning for example excel power bi sql vba etc,2
as a person who needs to deal frequently with data at my office my biggest nightmare is not getting required data from the stakeholders,0
i am from newyork and i am happy that you shared this video with us and the life i have dreamt about i am in my final year of college and i have been applying to a lot of job opportunities what kind of projects do you recommend to entry level data analyst i have been making dashboard in tableau and doing my analysis in excel and sql where do you get the datas to do self projects,2
use my link and check out the first chapter of any datacamp course for free to unlock new career opportunities and become data fluent today,2
this makes me so excited to be a data scientist thank you for the video,2
hi priya thank you for this video i am concluding my last year as a student receiving my bs in data analytics and i have so many questions that are causing me anxiety as i am nearing the end of my journey i have realized that the path in computer science dsda is not structured like one probably imagined it would be what i am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools python sql tableau r if what s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them but the real challenge starts after graduating in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs i have beginner level on all these programs right now but i feel like i probably won t be able to land a job in data analytics until i m at least intermediate in sql and at least python for starters i would appreciate your feedback and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science,0
thank you for this video this is extremely helpful as i am currently applying to data science and quantitative analytics positions,2
want to quickly commend you for the consistency and quality of your content i dont usually comment but from helping me with my uchicago application where i will be attending next year d to now supporting me in identifying my future career i am very interested in data science i am grateful to you for all your work thanks,2
this is an extremely hard coding task it deals with a custom datatype implies the iteration and verification of the end i wasted minutes and didnt resolve it all the solutions i have found include flattering with a separate method than iterating and len verification and the task is formalized in a way that next and hasnext methods should be enough to do the flattening which is again more difficult i am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune company coding interview comparing this with the explanation of the gradient descend is like chalk and cheese,0
i ve just concluded my bachelors in civil engineering but i am inclined to move to the data science field during my course i learned how to program in phythonin spyder and sql and i m still updated with those skills imagine you are in my shoes what should i do moving forward to learn more about data science and ensure i can get a job at it do you think it is necessary to take another course what are the general technical skills i have to master,1
great video i appreciate the honesty did you start as an analyst before moving to a data scientist role what role would you recommend for recent grads,2
a scientist who works in data science has been a godsend finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications after weighing my options i chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science before seeing your videos i was baffled as to why i continued being turned down for jobs despite having two masters degrees one in physics and the other in applied physics now that ive seen some of your vids i understand why glad i found your channel on youtube,2
just start my datacamp journey thank you for this helpful insight i have one question how do you know that some company just using you for their free project while they actually dont want to hire anyone,2
very understandable approach to explaining the differences in these roles its definitely appreciated especially with the blurred lines that companies often use to represent these fields,2
really nice video i am a current data analyst at a large tech company hoping to become a ml engineer eventually similar to a google software engineer whose capable of everything in that chart love the content keep it up,2
great video thanks for clearing that up and explaining the various elements of so many different roles in this field very helpful,2
i am a marketing project manager and i was wondering if i could shift my path to data scientistanalyst and your amazing video made it clear for me thanks very much,2
hours a day are possible on days where you return from daylight saving time to standard time,1
subs ive been seeing your video on my feed for a while now since i started roaming around to study software development but my true goal was to go up to the data scientist role thats just the goal i have in mind and you just revealed to me that i dont exactly need to become a software engineer first if i can land myself to a data analyst role the hierarchy showed me i can still walk up slowly to reaching my goal you are a god send,2
thanks man for clearing this up especially in india all it companies have made a mess about data jobswhy dont you make a video dscussing these jds especially from india these all are mncs,0
thats a very nice explanation id love to see each step indepth,2
companies nowadays prefer a generalist over a specialist who is super expert at one specific field only this is why developers experience burn outs so often they have almost no option but to spend a great portion of their time trying out new tech and whatever they learn will most likely be replaced by better resources,1
yep i can confirm as a phd research scientist that i do in fact have a side kick ml engineer actually to help me create all my crazy shit,1
follow me on instagram for live videos,1
this video helped me pass my data scientist interview thanks,2
i once had a question how the regressor would look like without any coeffecient except the intercept in a linear regression could not answer it right away but got the to the answer after a couple of mins i asked the job interviewer if anyone ever got it right after immediteatly and he said only one but he did not hire him so dont worry question arent everything its got more to do with the way you handle the situation with dignity and without being a liar also keep your head up iwrote hundred of applications and still ended up at a big corp,1
i love your videos i had one quibble about your sql solution to if some publishers have more videos than others then their video durations will affect the mean you could imagine one publisher with videos and publishers with videos in this case the average duration of that one superpublishers videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers i think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages of course this detail may not matter in an interview,2
lol very impressive that you can make a video about interview questions so fun to watch,2
i really love your channel it has helped me understand what ds really is i am an incoming freshmen and will be pursuing ds this seems hard right now but as the years go this will all make sense keep up the good work,2
i think this is a good video for suggestions on how to get a data science job at a larger company however in my experience data science interviews at nonlarge companies put a huge focus on machine learningdeep learning linear algebra statistics core python programming sometimes r sql sparkawsgcp and data visualization tableau matplotlib r,2
im sure everyone would love to hear about some materials youve gone through to follow this ds path getting an internship is impossible in japan,1
hi jonathan awesome video please rate the online data science or big data courses and share your opinion regarding if they are any good in landing you a job vs a masters in cs,2
hey joma the new thing now in data science interviews is modelling questions makes sense really curious if you would do a video on how to prepare for that for many companies that is the makeorbreak portion of the ds interview process,1
data nerds what skill are you currently working on that is a nontechnical skill ie soft skill analytical skill domain knowledge,1
dude love the cut outs great video,2
maaaaaan the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable despite of its level of complexity you make it sound somehow easy not because it is but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own there are many out there who put themselves on a superior position maybe caused by their formaleducation ego but for some reason you must follow their same steps which means youll never be as awesome as they are thanks for breaking it down for humans big hug from argentina and keeping on rocking with that good work,2
update comment i m one month into my new career as a data analyst at a large charter school company over analysts on our team i just wanted to come back here and say thank you i focused on positions within education changing from a year career as a math teacher and landed a position within a month of starting my job search sql and excel are used a lot my advice to anyone starting out is to get comfortable with those two programs especially inner joins with sql and pivottables with excel,2
fantastic video as a ba i can attest that sql and excel are still very much in demand after being at one job for years i had to put myself back on the market after doing the excel sql and powerbi assessments on linkedin to back my resume ahead of the screenings the jobs and some cool offers started rolling right in,2
excell sql python tablaeu spssstatistics anova,1
this is great i am trying to transition from salesmanagement to data analyst and eventually data science great video to help individuals like myself transitioning careers into something they truly enjoy problem solving,2
thanks for the insights luke just one quick question how was your experience of using windows on a macbook pro does it help with using excel sql etc keep up the good work,2
always entertained by what i learn from your channel luke thanks for reinforcing a wellrounded path to learning im gonna use ken jees days of data to shape my tech skills,2
thank you for this video it was very helpful i ve been wondering where to start and what to focus on this was clear and well spoken i have a few courses on udemy i m starting on excel data analytics python sql and a couple on wishlist including power bi and tableau that all include projects i guess i chose selection well thanks for confirmation also i m going to do coursera when i m done,2
data science roadmap learning a programming language python r in python libraries numpy panda statistics data visualization matplotlib seaborn machine learning do a project thank you,2
i am a data science student and believe me the things and insights im getting is just soo much amazing best wishes for all future data scientist,2
the quality of content shared above is simply an eyeopener cheers to you can we have more roadmap videos on ai and deep learning seperately,2
please make a roadmap for st year college students which would focus on things like when to start codinghow to learn new things and manage college studies also it would be better if it would focus on student who are from a tier college with high attendance compulsion,1
mam could u please start a course on python just like u have done on java and c i know u will help everyone at any cost because we trust u if possible then please start the course,2
hello your videos are always helpful for everyone for choosing there the correct careers my question is i am from mechanical branch and i want to switch my career in it field so please tell me what are the total sub branches in it field and what are their workings as there job profile and last not the least we all love your team,2

explanation is next level india needs this type of teachers in colleges its great to have u in india,2
would be great if you provide a course playlist for the same from basic to advanced,2
we got a very clear vision towards data science thank you we love to watch more videos related to this,2
whos ready for learning data science in,2
just learning enough moving on and iterating that s a great tip when learning almost anything i tend to go deeper in one of the initial steps and feel stuck,2
love the strategy and the not getting too deep into one subject advice definitely better to know a bit of everything than only one thing very well especially for interviews,2
this is pretty much how i went through it as well in the last few years i actually started web scraping before machine learning as ml really benefits from good scrapers and database building,2
ive been so stressed about how to best learn data science without wasting time and this is so helpful,2
hi tina thank you for providing these useful info for learning data science knowledge im going to pursue a msds soon and iv learned python ml mysql and some hadoop during my free time beside working on some resume projects and keep practicing the skills are there anything i can do to ensure myself getting an intern thank you very much,2
hey tina im about to watch this video after initially stumbling upon your video on the scoreboard youre a really awesome person and i really appreciate the effort youre putting into creating these videos i havent watched this current one yet but itd be great to hear whats changed over the year if anything i can already tell your editing and recording quality has improved a ton and thats not a sleight im excited to learn thanks again,2
thank you so much i am so happy i found your channel i am a software engineer worked for years now i am willing to transition my career to data science i am a person who try to go indepth into a topic and due to which at some point i get overwhelmed and discouraged your videos provided me great tips like study just what s required and implement it also you have given some resources to learn thank you please continue to share such more informative videos i am going to stay tuned and also start teaching myself the skills to be a data scientist please wish me luck thank you,2
hi tina im a sophomore studying in the uk and i was thinking of a path software engineering cyber security data science to follow for my career i was initially hesitant in trying to explore more on data science until i came across your video thank you very much for your insight anyways i also reached out on linkedin d gy,2
this video is soo good the number question ive had in moving into industry when i finish my phd is how much do i need to know about x to get a job when you said variable declaration loops and oop i was hooked thanks so much for the vid this was legit one of the most helpful vids ive found on this topic so far,2
this is my favorite channel i especially like it when you explain everything so nicely i wish you a lot of success with the channel and happy life this is a great channel i only caught sight of you folks in recent times but it s now among my favorite channels congratulations on such an amazing achievement cant wait to see your channel grow even bigger,2
you are idol for non tech background people who wants to career transaction towards it you actually understand our capabilities we love you i always follow you keep going,2
i m surprise how fast ur learning technologyand maintain consistency difficult for mebut ur videos really helpsthanks,2
i love the videos harry just a small correction those insights role is usually that of a data analyst or an insight solution analyst a data scientists role is usually dependent on statistics and applying the right ml models,2
beautiful explanation harry bhai highly recommended for all students and even beginner professionals harry bhai ke videos are one of the best sources of knowledge,2
hello harry bhai please make a series on matlab and their features like simulink stateflow and autocode generation its very important in automotiveautomobile industry if do you have any material or video serieslink please share with us and again thanks harry bhai for your efforts thank you,2
please complete the data structures and algorithms series please harry bhaiya,2
we want datastructure and algorithms playlist complete,1
thanks harry for informative videosi have a concerning question regarding choosing data science as nontech background with growing data science students would u think it will be still in demand in next yrs or so like if we start on this path it would take yrs and by that time it might be outdated or there will be abundance of data scientist how about videos on data scientist as a freelancer thanks again,1
hi i am from nont ech field so i found myself interested in this data science programme and also started watching your videos and practicing but i have a question that it would be valid learning from youtube only and not from any learning institute for getting job in future,2
steve is guru of sales and marketing,1
hi all expecting some questions so linking this qa for your reference will also be taking collecting questions on instagram so let s connect there,2
yayy we love a working queen,2
i ve learned that if you want to learn something new in the workplace you ve really have to seek it yourself the truth in those words,2
i got my first job on a data science team for this summer and have been super nervous about it and living alone your videos have been extremely inspiring and encouraging and i feel less anxious and more excited for this summer thank you julia,2
im so excited to see something like this in my future im a college freshman in cs with an emphasis on aiml and data science i cant wait to hopefully have a nice life like this i do know that you cant see everything through the lens of a camera so ill be sure to not let this dilute the difficulties youve been through to get to where you are today edit first year of college is over time to hone up on new skills and do my best to get past stage two of internship interviews though i am a freshman not impossible but most have been no s always next year,2
im a junior se and loved your vlog i think you hit on something at the end its just a job i used to glamorize the tech industry but im starting to see that the work is not always innovative and transformativesometimes its literally just a job lolkeep up the good work and cant wait to see more day in the life vlogs,2

somehow i am more comfortable with indian professors than that with others great contain delivered by highly experienced professors,2
excellent material for simple understanding of the basic concepts thank you for sharing this material and making it available for free,2
i have done ml course from upgrad but now when i see these videos they are amazing the professors had made it so easy to understand i regret why i didnt join great learning instead anyways thanks for sharing these videos please do share more videos great learning really have great professors also if there is any short term courses of month which explain all these things in one place it would be great,2
need more topics to cover by this amazing professor,2
such a great teaching style with practical knowledge of industry statistics and programming by combining all these surely we are going to delighted thank you great learning for uploading such great content,2

i dont know why all the youtubers explains stuffs better than my teachers but this video is crystal clear to understand,1
thank you very much for this video please note reinforcement learning is not the semisupervised learning semisupervised learning is a mixture of supervised and unsupervised methods but reinforcement learning is a more complex and challenging method to be realized but basically it deals with learning via interaction and feedback,2
i would like to thank all the youtube teachers for explaining the topics crystal and clear,2
thanks krish i was looking for a video that could clarify the differences between ai mc dp and data science and after looking all around youtube i found your video it was awesome im looking forward your next videos hugs from brazil,2
finally a good explanation that doesnt hide confusion behind jargon thanks,2
hi krish i have always been interested in ai and things around it about it you nailed it man a naive like me who has some faint idea of ai could simply understand and know further about dl ml too very useful video thanks much,2
hai sir thank you for this video i dont know even a single alphabet in this subject when compared to all other viewers but now a days i hear a lot about artificial intelligence ml dl ds around me so i thought to at least know what they mean i struck the correct video at the first attempt and i put your lecture in white and black which came to pages while viewing and hearing the lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software i just use word xl for my job has come to know about the above subjects to the extent what you delivered if i have understood then the people who are already in this subject would have got a lot of useful information now if i tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how i could knew about this subject thanking your sir once again i am yrs old can i learn and become de or da or ds,2
youve hit bulls eye exactly what one wants when starting with ai or ml or dl,1
currently watching as the quarantine period is in process and this helped me understand thank you for this amazing explanation,2
i have been a data scientist for three years as a data scientist one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in the fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interestdomain of expertise moreover companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science its better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise hence im leaving data science and starting my phd,1
i am a structural engineer this is a good field for data science since most civil engineers dont learn programmingcoding and when they do they just shift to it industry data science will be very crucial for monitoring the life of structures,2
i agree to some points but disagree to some i dont think studying data science and knowledge gained will be worthless in years the core statistics and maths learned in the degree will be useful decades to come yes some aspects of tech stack will change but the same thing happens in other computer science fields as well the data science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we dont know how things will pan out in years down the line,1
dear sir data analyst and data scientist shares a lots and lots of diffrence btw them data scientist have to deal with ai which requires data to built an algorithm based on machine learningself driving cars requires ai biotechnology companies requires ai and in the age of aino one can stops ai and data scientist to thriveand every profession always have pros and consnothing in world is perfectask yourself siris computer science was in demand back yrsas it was now,1
namaste sir that was a really informative video actually a lot of professors from iits also have quoted this issue of growing false love among students for data science ai the whole crux is that these things are just merely tools to solve research problems in other domains and thus making computational easier just like a bridge which connects two islands most people do not understand this logic and hence go forward in this career because it is in demand you have demystified many myths via this video also sir what is your take on pursuing advance degree in nanotechnology because am an ece student and really interested to do research in this area,1
thank you professor for giving such crucial information how about mis management in information systems for ms in usa does even that has the same supplydemand ratio problem or is it safe bet to pursue masters in that field throw some light on it professor,2
thank you for this video i am going for a phd in business data science and was wondering what steps i can take to make sure that i can be successful in this field i have worked as a data scientist in fintech companies in india for years and now going forward with my graduate studies your videos have been very inspirational,2
thank you for the information i am going for a phd in geospatial data science i have experience in programming and have a background in remote sensing and gis as you talked about finance and banking i would like to know your opinion on the careers in the geospatial industry if we have data science skills i would be glad to hear back from you,2
thanks a lot sir im struggling in making a decision upon data science ai and cybersecurity im currently in network engineering field i initially thought of doing a masters in cybersecurity or data science as i felt that ai would conquer the cybersecurity and data in future im searching for an explaination you explained very well sir could you please tell whether there would be opportunities for those who have switched the carrier to ai field much merits to you sir from sri lanka,2
hi professor can you please elucidate more on ms in business analytics how is it different from ms in data science does ba has less technicalities in terms of mathematics and statistics and more oriented towards businessfinance side like a mba,1

thanks for watching what does your data science path looks like,2
overview study the various roles in data science by researching and asking people and figure out what is best for you after you a role study the jd for that role in various companies check what is needed in order for you to qualify for that role go on linkedin and study the profiles of people who are already in that role the coding is not necessarily the first thing that you need to learn studying the theoretical conceptual part first is suggested after the concepts are clear now learn coding and try to work on data work on a project kaggle is a great place to start nope were not done here prepare for interviews solving problems in a limited time frame under a pressure setting tip do as many moc tests as possible under time constraints,1
hi sundas i have a career in auditing and over time i ended up focusing on producing data models by pulling data from sap erp these days this work is often done by data analysts it requires knowing the data base and handling analytics tools sql script python etc i am learning python and i am preparing for the cap certified analytical professional certification to learn the methodology and accredit my qualification after listening to you i think i should prioritize statistics with my experience i think that i should orient myself towards business data analytics thanks for the info,1
thanks for the shout out sundas great video,2
hi sundas great video i am trying to make a switch from operations to analytics and i learned excel and tableau first and then learnt to code completely agreed that knowing the tool isn t enough you gotta be a pro to make them believe you have what it takes,2
thanks for the video sundas i still struggle to know what data science role i want to do id love to hear more of your thoughts on picking direction when you dont yet have experience theres a big gap between the skills i have now and some of the positions i am interested but im hoping that i can still move around in the field as i learn more my data science journey started last year during the pandemic when i was locked out of my phd lab and needed to do something productive my process so far data science in r series from harvard on edx reading practical statistics for data science with a bookclub python programming course pre learned some linear algebra calculus a ml course b data science fellowship with ds a now learning sql online always engage in ds community and attend talks to learn about various topics next applied machine learning class to do some project work and also i should finish my phd this semester,2
its so greatfull of you sundas mam to mentor us gracefully im just but see my future as data scientist and always get many more to learn from u mam please keep motivating students like me and others as well need more videos on data scientist,2
hi sundas i am a chemical engineer working in industrial automation for several years i spent several years drawing conclusions from tons of process trendings and doing data visualization when i i didnt know what it really was until i found your ig and thats when i knew i was into data analytics i am doing the google data analytics certificate course and it is great so far i am also hesitating to stepping into the data scientist role but i will see how the data analytics goes first thanks for inspiring me to give my career a new direction changing at is not easy,2
thanks so much for clearing it out i am learning data science on my own i started learning statistics few months ago almost done i was a little confused and restless if i made the right choice by learning statistics first i read a lot of comments on quora where people said that coding should be the first step it didnt make much sense to me now its all clear and i have gained confidence after watching your video i have a similar road map to what you just said thanks so much for inspiring and giving us so much info all the best and really looking forward to watch your future videos,2
thank you so much for this ideas you are very correct and i got to know that as it fell in line with the structure of datacamp schedule where i am learning data science now i also appreciate you for mentioning kaggle because i have been thinking where or how can i implement the little i have learnt well done,2
check my new video where i made a metroidvania using microsoft paint only it s pretty epic,2
quite a lot of progress for year congrats and keep learning,2
woah truly got surprised to see this channel with k subs the editing and content was spectacular earned a sub from me excited to see what other content you ll be coming out with,2
great editing brother had my attention the entire time,2
this video is really good editing voice over creativity everything in every sense,2
im most impressed by your animations honestly very nice,2
even your early games made more from boredom than interest are impressive you learned so much game dev in a year makes me feel more motivated to start in earnest,2
i started making game yday second attempt here too year ago i tried and failed and im so happy when i heard that what im going through is normal its really hard to stick to something nowadays and when you said something about making game simple so you dont quit i really felt that lmao anyways good luck on making gta in mate,2
really humorous and inspiring great stuff,2
this was a really interesting video ive been toying around with the idea of making my own game after seeing toby fox and eric barone do it on their own but ive always feared the learning process when i probably should have been excited for it on a side note are you dutch or belgian a lot of my favourite content creators have a similar accent to yours and ive taken note of how many content creators there are from these countries makes me wonder if certain culturally facilitated living standards leads to more content creators,2
when people say i want to make a game like gta it s like when children say they want to be astronauts,1
game dev in my head im gonna make a hyper realistic level with amazing movement combat and an adaptive ai game dev in reality help ive imported a mesh and crashed my computer,0
making games has never been easier making a good game will forever be hard,1
this video is really good and legit i do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age there are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free the learning process to build an entire game is long and difficult especially if youre thinking of an rpg in my experience single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience multiplayer games are a stretch to even tryalone or with a small team but dont let the reality beat you up if you really really want something you can make it happen ive been making games with blender and unity for nearly years and have prototypedconcepted my own rpg times only now in am i confident enough to build the official version but ive done it ive learned enough to make it happen and you can too knowing is one thing then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life creation is king never give up,2
as a solo game developer whenever i want to implement a new thing i get crushed by the overwhelming amount of details ive to do thank you for the video,1
this is exactly why i respect game developers i once made a simple arcade game with a bit of coding with c and i swear i almost put a hole in my monitor because the code wasnt working the way i wanted it to but when you finally do get the code to work what you feel is almost indescribable,2
it certainly feels like having jobs at once while still working a regular job to finance your development,1
games are the most complex type of media cause they take all aspects of creativity together,2
solo dev here and the part about marketing is totally true my game shameless plug link on my channel trailer was a complex effort where i learned a lot about animation music and sound mixing some seemingly simple things like sound settings and zoom took the longest during development and when it was all over people who played my game said it was pretty good but it was hardly even seen by anyone the marketing thing was something i never considered so its going to be a focus with my next game i made a game and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places and that i naively expected steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there if anyones wondering how accurate this video is the answer is somewhere around great video too editing was great and music was well chosen,2
i come from indie to aaa studio as game programmer if theres something to add every discipline has it own depths on knowledge perfecting stuff like design pattern design principle code conventions cicd pipeline automate test etc for programmers is needed when your project grow that come along as other department maybe at the first time you think you wont need dedicated project manager that handling all daily task and scrum but when project get larger team gets bigger you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation heck if you love making games later on you wont even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on if you just started game dev make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear will you create your own studio or work for big companies which discipline what studio this can be matter as a programmer artist who need align their technology artstyle there so much to prepare and i cant write all of those question in one post hope everyone who read this post can consider your journey even harder not make you scared of gamedev but thinking more critically because this could be your future work and huge part of your life,1
my game arcadian rift is now available on steam for wishlisting please consider adding it,2
advice dont try making real games at first build up confidence with small throwawayexploratory projects with a im just learning mindsetreally important,1
ive been making games for about a year now and thomas has been making them for about years so thats about twice as long david,1
i think the best part of this video is that his advice can be used for more than just game development,2
the most important thing i took away from my programming professor is if your code is doing the thing you intended it to thats the right way to do it dont get hung up on doing it the right way you can always optimize later,2
its two different things to start learning and to make your first serious game when you start learning if you go straight away to make your dream game it will likely be frustrating because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game creating a copy or a remake of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn when i started learning unity some years ago after doing a few tutorials i decided i would create a remake of duke nukem d using some of the assets of duke nukem forever and remaking the first level of the game in blender this was so that i could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project it took me i believe months to finish it it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game and yes it played terrible and nothing like the original but the amount of learning i did thanks to this learning project was really a lot i dont think i could have learned faster other way another point i would mention is learning to code i think was the most important thing i did when i started making games my game ideas were limited to what i imagined i would be technically capable of implementing after i got a good grasp of coding i feel and i know i could make anything i can imagine given the time to do so,1
i love how you are being open to your community this helps the community to feel engaged in your projects anyways i feel like this advice of yours can really help me in what i need to do so thanks hope you have a great day also what if you release your pizzatime game to public xd,2
honestly cant thank you enough for this im just starting off picking an engine and while im going to be doing it solo a lot of this advice is helpful beyond just game development being a visual artist as well i can actually attest to how important the bit about isolation is nothing gasses up your motivation like being able to cross pollinate ideas and support each other,2
i am so excited to start my dev journey thankyou for the inspo,2
one year insane im gonna get there months to go,2
okay everyone scroll down to see the correct answers for the problem polygon all meshes are made from polygons within games polygons must be sidedtriangles though typically in animation and d design polygons are sided code all it needs is code so we can start giving the ball commands on what to do and when d in almost all scenarios will run slower in comparison almost anything can slow down a game though an k d image with an intense shadermaterial will put a lot more stress on the game than a normal d model,1
i feel more confident that i can actually learn gamedev knowing yanderedev made something that a lot of people enjoyed and he didnt even know most of the info in this video,2
can t wait to make my first game for the airplane,2
ive been a dev for years and have never had development explained in this way i think this is one of the best development videos for beginners,2
polygons or tris more specifically you would add code preferably a character controller the sphere would make the game run slowest,1
just what i needed to know to start making my first game call of mario,2
timestamps main pic scenes effects assets code systems problem,1
been a game developer for years and you opened my eyes to the fact that all of this info isnt common knowledge and theres people who live without it and i was once one of them thanks for giving me a system error you earned a sub,1
such a great simplified yet essential breakdown,2
i feel like he is that one computer coding teacher that actually put it in a way that we understand thanks for the basics,2
i really can agree with it increased my appreciation for those games since ive got into game dev i know hoooow much work for exaple aaa games like red dead are,2
i just finished my first month of learning game dev with unity and seeing this motivates me and excites me to see just how much i can learn in the next months thanks for this video,2
preoptimisation is my biggest weakness as a sw engineer it kills a lot of passion and motivation for projects if it s not perfect it s very hard to correct,0
love how you added rpg maker as a game engine there very underated but very amazing,2
sometimes being an organized individual has its cons when it comes to increased task anxiety in not being able to keep a rigid schedule sounds like many others here in the comments can relate as well just gotta go with the flow and see the results build up over time,1
im not sure how i got recommended this from the youtube algorithm but im glad i did after mindlessly eating half a box of cheezits and finishing the video i was surprised to see the view count the editing was great and i was thoroughly intrigued i havent seen any other of your videos but i hope you get one that blows up you seem to be going in the right direction though because i got recommended this video despite sparingly watching tech content best of luck,2
thank you for making this i fall into the trap of scheduling too i ve recently adopted your method of just working on it when i want to it makes the dev much more enjoyable using monogame instead of unity tho amazing video,2
i thought it would ruin the magic of video games if anything it enhances it tenfold for me anyway i love thinking about how things could possibly be programmed whenever i m playing a game sometimes i think of how i would tell a computer to complete daily tasks like pouring a glass of water,2
finalbossblues is awesome ive been subscribed for ages for my own projects and i know the number of tutorials isnt quite as high but i would recommend godot to d beginners its relatively clean and easy to pick up completely open source and less than gb i think the steam version is mb but the full package straight off the website is closer to mb and yet still fully functional so very quick and easy to try out i really like gdscript pythonesque and the scene heirarchy is pretty intuitive i admit i keep getting hung up on optimisation not just because like you i work in another development area during my day job but because i want anything i make to be playable on a potato if possible but it really slows downhalts my progress need to shoulder my way through that like you recommend,2
thankyou so much for your support over the last few weeks its honestly been so crazy also make sure you join the discord server,2
tbh this gives me inspiration being someone who has wanted to make games since a very very young age i have had the idea to make my own little studio called the crying arcade and im just now learning how to do stuff seeing the amount of progress you made with just a moving cube it genuinely gives me hope it makes me feel like i have a chance thanks man,2
after year in unity i see you have improved so much keep it up at this rate you will hit k k or even m,2
thats great your history of creating video games is so interesting such motivation to start unity,2
i really want to learn c in unity so this is definitely something to look up to,2
your first games are actually very impressive the problem i had and have rn is learning coding on unity there is now where to learn c,2
the rate at which youre growing is amazing you had k subscribers months ago and now you have over k wish you the best for the future of this channel,2
i am a complete beginner at game dev and this vid really inspired me to keep going so thanks for making this vid,2
hey man keep up the good work your progress is amazing,2
awesome video very inspiring just started my c journey a while back and gonna be jumping in unity soon i hope i will be making as much progress as you did damn,2
hi everyone i realized i didnt actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games thats why ethical monetization is my specialty now so for sure theres data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions it also encompasses monetization and systems design though i wasnt formally trained in monetization design before joining its actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first monetization design encompasses things like battle passes loot box designs game ecoystem design hard currency to soft currency what resources are tradable and purchasable etc designing events and seasons what content should be available how is it distributed what does progression and rewards look like in an event etc and ofc the pricing of it all we also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones we often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction purchase regret mau revivals etc to get a sense of this my role today though focuses on a broader list of things not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well i made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out,2
this video was really inspiring and insightful to watch thank you for sharing your story and also the tip on skillset to interest framework i never thought of that idea especially since i am someone who doesn t necessarily know what roles i would be a best fit for but also that matches my current skillset still in the process of exploration anyways thank you for the video,2
great to hear your story was an amazing journey please use your smarts for good and make game monetization less predatory for all who play the games you work on its an incredibly important issue and im so happy to hear that people are thinking about and specializing in work like that,2
hi morgan just want to tell you that i really loved the skillset to interest framework it really did a good job im not a gamerelated worker but this thing helps me up to retrospect my career skill set thanks for making this video,2
loved this video there are so many videos that just say do this this and youll eventually get into the industry but you managed to break your journey down into a series of manageable steps looking forward to seeing more content from you,2
only halfway into the video the way of breaking down the job roles within the industry has been immensely helpful and information friendly to new gamers designers or hopefuls wanting to join the game industry,2
tldr shes not a game developer shes a salesbusiness analystprogram manager this video didnt really help me but others might find your mechanism useful if they are interested in considering job requirements to your skill set framework which to me seems obvious but nothing wrong with that,1
its a very informative video and its genuinely interesting to hear your journey on the other hand the title is definitely a clickbait the video has very little to do with how to become a developer rev analyst is not a developer nor is the product manager role,2
morgan this is awesome one because i love league of legends been playing since like season and its just amazing to see people that have a vision for their life plan work hard to achieve it and succeed im one of those as well got a degree in neurosciencepsychology fell in love with web dev learned the skills that i needed and been working as a web dev for about months and life has been a dream ever since,2
so basically you arent a game dev youre a production manager,1
for every wishlist ill do another pushup,1
you have achieved more in years that a whole team of people in absolutely phenomenal,2
congrats on two years of exciting development incredibly inspiring,2
congrats man on your years youre a legend,2
dude honestly this just looks amazing and i think its simply inspiring to see someone make this possible it means we could do it as well maybe if we work as hard as you,2
i remember seeing your first devlog years ago and just knowing it wasnt going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right i havent seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i dont think i will ever see anything like this again if i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you i cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month awesome work keep it up and best of luck also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesnt enough also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job looks dope,2
noice congrats on years the concept art for enemies and missions is looking sick and im excited for what the future holds,2
ive been watching since the start this is the best devlog ever and i cant wait till its done,2
bro this is genuinly nuts an inspiration to a lot of us the amount you have got done and learned in years is crazy good job,2
its absolutely nuts that this is your first game project and it looks so promising already just imagine what youll be able to do in the future if this one is a success,2
i didnt know mark is such a pretty good artist those art concepts and sprites for his old game ideas looks really nice i always thought the phase of prototype is always super important to make sure if a game is gonna be good i think is possible to already have these characters and this music and this story if thats the goal of a game still i can see how game design can evolved those concepts into something more fitting for whatever the gameplay can be,2
im the dev who integrated d physics into unity and i thoroughly enjoyed watching this i think ill be going into the attic to dig out my folder of ideas from my youth too,2
reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters we had a course that was just making a game in groups of after week of production everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing i felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked why does it look so pretty as a critique for this exact reason he seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early because it was too early too tell if their idea worked yet they had spent time making it look amazing,2
gmt dont over think or over prepare your game me with adhd and wanting to make a metroidvania style game visible sadness,0
i really recommend you checking out a book the art of game design and it s chapter about prototyping it really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of is there a potential in this design it s a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode great video i think more people should know this stuff,2
to summarize if you dont make a cheap and fast prototype for your game then your game is an overdeveloped prototype and good luck with that,2
tldr mark learned to focus on the primary loop looks amazing already mark,2
have you considered using the recoil of the magnet when you catch it to give you a little push maybe as a kind of directional double jump,1
another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually enjoy game design or not if youre having more fun coming up with the story setting lore and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas then chances are youre more into worldbuilding than game design learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests,2
hey man ive been building these lets call them prototypes for many years im a programmer and game designer and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days but when it comes to art i just shut down im genuinely awful at the art part so ive always teamed up with artists problem is i then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that its wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect and it suffers as a result eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what weve learned i know this stupid vicious cycle well,0
most of what youre talking about here is called abstraction despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes its a core tenet of software development and my primary concern when designing application enhancements for my job id much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue but also related past issues as well as potential future ones in the end if done well it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability its also a puzzle that i tend to take as personal challenges,1
and yes i realize that future mark problems are starting to stack up a bit welcome to game development or software development in general or really making anything,1
now that mark knows how to make games he can take part in the gmtk game jam one of the biggest game jams ever,2
just to clarify it for everyone whos starting when mark said its worth putting in some extra effort at the beginning he did not mean before the mvp before you havent first inspected your core ideas are worth pursuing and which are not fail fast fail early inspect and adapt,1
i m so grateful that you focused on the boring stuff in this video it was very illuminating thanks,2
here is my feedback i totally got the eureka moments in every level it will be easier to automatically grab de magnet i got softlocked many times so the restart was nice i dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset initially i thought i should return to the key hub that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic ill love to move while aiming it feels more fluent the key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but i dont know how well it fits in the game the doors werent like the key type so it doesnt make sense to open them with it also its kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character for example making the positive smile and the negative sad the main character could shine more while aiming maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim overall i loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so i could try it,2
imagine being talented and dedicated enough to not just make a game on your own but also make a high quality video series detailing your design processes at the same time really amazing stuff,2
and so i abused my internet fame to get someone much smarter than me to build that exact thing i just described fantastic line,0
love this series ill admit i was a little sceptical when you changed things on your channel but i am really enjoying this maybe even more than the video essay type videos kutgw,2
as a game developer i have always taken the boring stuff incredibly seriously if you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire games campaign or whatever else in fact and i discovered this the same way you did mark by building that framework often times you will accidentally end up building an mvp or demo at the same time i did this as well im still working on my first game but just recently i started closing in on the final lines of code for my unreal engine framework that i will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off as in when im not the only employee well im working on my framework and i look at the level ive built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added and i realized i basically just built a prealpha demo for my game all i need is to make the level actually look good because my level design skills are awful and i basically now have a prealpha project its funny how that can happen sometimes either way i always take this stuff seriously frameworks are everything in my opinion having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it,1
for the next days get d art pro for off plus my d program totally free learn game dev get off with code letsgamedev learn d art get off with code letsgo get my d game kit free,2
i was about to start making my first game my dream game glad i saw this and now i m gonna get a few small games under my belt before my dream game,2
i started my d platformer when i was just starting to learn unity and c i ended up taking a break to make a smaller game a d bullet hell shooter called hypershot i put it on steam and i still get a sale now and then now im almost finished my platformer which will be on steam next year,2
hey glad to see this im about to start making my first game thomas always has the best advice,2
tip consider your hourly rate as a dev and its relation to your budget tip dont make everything from scratch time is money tip dont make your first game your dream game it should be your minute crap game youll figure out your strengths tip focus on prototyping its easier to build in pieces and funding will motivate you tip build a community discord and social media,1
i wanted to make a d survival game with a massive map with multiple biomes weird animals diseases allergies and of course cut scenes once i drew the design on some paper i realized that i never had coded before so this would be way to hard now i watched this video and i think my first game will just be a simple platformer,1
these are some amazing tips and the one about not doing everything from scratch really made me realize how much time im wasting as for games i worked on a game for most of last year and now that i look back on it i made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but i did find out i am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus i learned a lot about the type of games i am mostly good at making,2
your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me i too pride my self in character building and story telling those are my passions what keeps me making my game this being my first game you re other tip was perfect i should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story dream game this video hit at the perfect time for me and thank you for your content one question about your stories do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art,2
i did release my own game on ios about ten years ago it was the only personal project i ever released i outsourced all the creative assets just to save myself time crossing the finish line with this stuff is very challenging i totally agree making your crap game first is the way to go great video,2
i really enjoy these tip type videos thomas they are really motivating i have my first smallsized project game in mind and it motivated me to not b afraid of using assets if needed thanks for being motivating proud to be part of the gamedev community,2
cool video i always enjoy seeing game developer improvement over time keep going,2
bro this is awesome keep up the good work man ik that your work will shine at one point,2
awesome stuff,2
cool video keep making the content its very fun to watch though it does keep me of from doing my homework oh and um make a game for ios next s,2
well done,2
really good video it s similar to mine but better lol,2
thanks for the insight,2
super underrated video and now i got inspired to make a gta clone too,2
actually underrated,0
cant wait until the game releases,2
i love your videos and happened upon then through my recommended feed by showing all of your thought processes going into your designs and wealth of knowledge of architecture your passion made me want to support you and chef rpg through kickstarter i cant wait to see the final product and finally hop into the world you created,2
the game has a really nice identity im happy to contribute to it noah manages our project wonderfully and nikita impresses me since the beginning with his pixel art,2
i really like the path this game is going towards the world looks and feels alive yet captivatingly out of this world i would love to help you in a way english and turkish are my primary languages so you can reach to me if you need any translation work to turkish in the future since thats all i can do,2
oooh it is so good to see the new inworld characters sprites also some of the latest decors look soo insane you and clement did such a great job,2
the new character sprites look so good seems like you ve come so far in such a short amount of time with the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art but the code i assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when i saw your st devlog almost years ago i was impressed then and even more so now watching chef rpg progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer it s not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev i can t wait for the next update,2
the complexity throughout blows me away theres enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that instead youre making a game with loads more to explore and do the amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what i love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place,2
omg the new character sprites look fantastic the combination of someone with architectural experience a character artist and a sprite artist sounds very powerful,2
love the thought that went to this games design and the improvments and overall progress you made thus far really glad i was able to back this project,2
respect for all your hard work bro the game looks so amazing modern day art,2
you guys should get a world wide credit for any improvements in the field of cse in upcoming years thank you for giving us these things for free,2
im only two hours in and i feel like my brain is swelling and going to burst out of my eye sockets ears nose and mouth from all the pure knowledge youre giving me thank you this is the tutorial i was looking for youre actually teaching me the terms and functions and what they mean and not just teaching me how to copy text thank you,2
this just shows how good youtube can be for teaching several one hour long lessons compressed into a single video for everyone to watch for free no matter where you are,2
thank you so much this teacher is the best teacher from a tutorial ive ever had clear entertaining and easy to follow well done,2
for beginners like me this is pure gold bb thanks for posting your vids,2
i know its corona times but look at all the resources that are available for free what a time to be alive love it,2
omg you dont know how thankful i am for this tutorial ive been trying to find a tutorial that explains every single thing in a line of code for me for so long thank you so much,2
very good tutorial even if this tutorial is one year old id like to add something for the inheritance i think it wouldve been worth mentioning the protected accessibility level for variables for those that dont know a protected variable is the same as a private one except that the variable will be treated as if it was public for the child classes its pretty useful in cases like the one shown in this video,2
hours of free content actually teaching you something and for free thank you,2
i wanted to thank you so much for this tutorial im a total beginner and everything is explained so well and in a pleasant pace also im very thankful for the nice structuring of the video which really helps going back and finding the topics that you need easily thanks a lot for your effort it really is helpful,2
fantastic game with seemingly endless potential other games in this genre feel outdated in comparison impressive for ea release,2
i really like the name sapiens that you landed on because that name isnt just prehistoric humans it is a game about sapiens it could be prehistoric medieval modern future or anything because of this you arent stuck with only cavemen it can go as far as you want and the modders want,2
i m addicted to this game you gave me the game i ve wanted for years thank you,2
i discovered this project literally a few hours ago and now just minutes ago you upload a video discussing launch i have missed so much but i m very much looking forward to release,2
been playing this game for the last week and its brilliant id love to see some sort of interaction with rivers and the terraforming that can be used to create sapienmade canals and such looking forward to the future updates,2
your reaction to the release at the end with your family was so fucking wholesome congrats you are living the game dev dream,2
since we are talking about mines i wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines now i understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines which i love because they leave a large impact on the world but it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often that is why i thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future there could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is far later into development you could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts the way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks a major issue with this though is how the camera system would work i could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however i feel like that might not fit the game i wouldnt have an issue with it but others may of course you can always do your standard st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldnt work when trying to make mineshafts i think edit i guess maybe you could still do your st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground another thing i thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground i say that as if it is easy when i actually know hardly anything about game development but i do believe that should be achievable but going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldnt which i think would be cool of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse,1
it s been an amazing journey to follow absolutely crazy to think i was just when you started work on this congrats on the early access launch d,2
been one heck of a ride watching this project for the past few years and finally seeing it come together youve made something really special and i wait to see where you go from here,2
following the development of sapiens has been a lot of fun i hope the game continues beeeing developed for a long time and really well done making the game its amazing and pushing through past the honeymoon period of the development process,2
hey everyone instead of the normal devlogs i put together this short summary of how i got into gamedev i hope this is interesting and if you havent already consider subscribing the next video will be a normal devlog again,2
as a software engineer im doing everything the exact oposite way you are d the code being the easy part and graphics being the hard part you are really artistically talented love to follow your devlogs,2
super inspiring im about a year and a half into my learning and it makes me feel a lot better about abandoning projects,2
amazing how much history and experience goes into what looks like a relatively simple game you make it look so easy but it s so much more than meets the eye,2
years thats incredible loved hearing about how you started think its quite interesting to see how you love for drawingmodelling got you into making games,2
thats awesome looks like it was a long journey but youve learned a lot im currently on about my th overlyambitious doomed project but i hope i can finish something decent soon,2
i just want to appreciate the amount of effort youve put into making actual projects i often find myself just fiddling around with ideas in my head and not making any project myself i feel that has been a limiting factor in my learning but this video has been super inspirational i have been wanting to make my own devlog series but i was not able to stick to a project long enough till now i have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of months and just finish a full game any tips to just stick to it,2
absolutely loved seeing some of the old insect designs super cool stuff,2
ive been struggling to get anywhere with my project im glad you havent given up and i love the asthetic and ideas you have for your current project dont give up,2
your progress over the years is astounding this new game youve been working on looks amazing and is just the sort of game i would love to play i hope you keep at it,2
making a game watch this next how to design fun games join our discord over game developers like the video to tell me you want a part,1
quite inspiring story i think most of us would be definitely interested in getting to hear a nd part of your journey,2
as as a games student in my first year of college this has really inspired me to keep pushing myself keep it up mate,2
congrats,2
ive just started working at the game industry after studying gamedev too and its amazing that i can see myself in your story although i dont work for a aaa studio but time will tell,2
im years old just finally starting to getting round to learning programming and unity completely new to it but really enjoy watching these types of videos gives me more motivation ill probably never learn as much as you would have going to uni and stuff but its all fun and learning even if i just make some shitty d games thatll be cool haha,2
ive been working in game dev for years and it seems the best job offers comes not from hrs tech interviewers skill evaluations but the people that just understand what exact people they need in their team and just invite you over at least from my experience in east europe also when comparing your uk collegeuniversity experience to what we have in east europe you are in a intergalactic space age,2
a friend recommended this video to me to inspire me to work harder on my course in level games design from level i figured itd be quite easy but damn i was mistaken this video has fully inspired me to push more and research more of my course so thank you for this year journey it was very inspiring and keep it up,2
amazing story makes me regret wasting so much time during collage when i knew i wanted to develop my game dev skills,2
as a person who is still in school knows no coding language other than html and css very interested in game design favourite game being sea of thieves just mindblowing,2
you still have clapped british teeth,0
already years of putting everything together it looks like a proper game good job,2
wow it has been a journey good job on the years of progress i reckon this game is going to a banger,2
congratulations on years of game dev awesome progress over the years,2
man this is so exciting i can t wait to see what this game will be about i m also starting my game dev journey and you re my motivation fuel keep grinding and i hope the best for your future,2
its amazing how far this project has gone this is really a main inspiration for why i have picked up game development again,2
i look forward to more game dev content,2
this game is incredible good work,2
this really did have a vibe of a professional youtube video ive really enjoyed the editing style keep rockin in the free world,2
keep it up bro youll blow up like this i love your humor and editing and also your story is so cool i am excited about your game,2
along with employees of course lol thats a really good point i just want to tell those who come up like hey so im basically making gta in unity and ill release it on steam next week,2
fun cheats in bioshock when the player recieves lethal damage he gets a few seconds of god mode leading to more barely survived moments in gears of war the last bullet in a magazine deals x damage leading to more barely defended myself moments,0
coding your own games is easier than you think skip ad,2
dont tell me that i cant make an open world mmo rpg fantasy game on my own in two weeks,1
i love how when he was talking about the importance of the players role that when he said just running around doing tasks for the sake of it he showed cod footage,2
im doing ict in highschool and our teacher showed us this video in class i find game design very interesting and i wish to pursue it in the future i just wanted to thank you for making informative and entertaining content like this youre inspiring people to take up game making,2
its so great to see you talk about game design i really think you should make a separate video about each one of those themes i see a lot of developers that know how to make games but dont really know how to make them fun and if you can teach them that youll be one step ahead of pretty much every channel like yours,2
great video it may be overwhelming for someone just starting out but actually you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these but mentioning important aspects of each for example the part of rules and the events in the game was great and even though it seems obvious i never thought about that i dont make games myself though but i find game making incredibly interesting and difficult,2
thank you brackeys ive had so much trouble with designing my own games thanks for sharing your knowledge with everyone,2
you give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them please keep up the great work and we will all keep watching,2
the first game is wonder and so well polished imagine if it was released in s it wouldve wiped the market,2
all these games seem pretty good but the first is definitely my favourite the second game looks nice enough however the gameplay looks rather bland,2
the first game is awesome the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more the third one was quite cool but a bit boring also is horror game material the fourth game looked like if it was made by a year old but still cool,2
based on their fiverr pages the first game appears to have cost the second third and last one is listed at i would have to say was easily the best investment,2
the first game could end up being successful with proper funding and development i love the idea of the recoil that launches you imagine that they added bosses multiplayer etc,2
the first one definitely felt more varied and had more to it compared to the others which they did do what they were requested but the other just lookedgeneric in a way while the first had enemies with ai that would attack you interesting level design and the movement and gunplay had more personality to thembeing able to move the gun in any direction using recoil to jumplift off the ground as well as different types of guns to play with i guess it just had more polish to it compared to the others too,2
the third game looks like it will change into an creepypasta type of game,1
what were the costs for each one thats very important the first one stands out a lot the others feel very dull,1
the developer of the first game is sick great game,2
the first game was a really clever reference to no time to explain with very similar mechanics and pretty much the same genre,2
links to all the stuff mentioned on the unity asset store ez camera shake player prefs editor all in sprite shader behavior designer synty studios pinwheel studios sidearm studios,1
been in game development at least yrs now i literally lost track greatest advice given here is to target a niche and do something special platformers and zombie games are a dime a dozen pick out something unique thats cool maybe something that no one has done in many years thats how stardew valley blew up on steam,2
tip can t be stressed enough i spent my first year learning courses on coursera and udemy thinking i d get into game design once i m ready that day never came no matter what i learned i never felt ready yet then one day i just started working on my project and said i d learn new things where i needed to honestly doing things this way made me progress faster than any course ever has,2
i have to agree there is no shame in having the docs open all the time memorizing everything isnt what gives you skill the important skill is knowing where to find the details when you need them,1
not sure if its mentioned in this video but something i feel should be said in every tips video like this dont do your dream project first you will ruin it if you dont give up first,0
the tip i see missing from all of these videos is take inspiration from wide sources not just your favorite games whats the good in the game you otherwise hate what do you like about that book you just read how can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched this is what they mean when they say good artists copy great artists steal when you steal something you make it your own and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations it becomes truly yours,0
you didnt waste those years you learned so much you did so many things these things add up in the future we think we can learn everything in yt videos but experiencing it firsthand gives you a much deeper understanding of things,2
shaders were super intimidating but i spent a weekend learning them and am so glad i did it i feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later and have been using them nonstop i needed to use them for one effect but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing it s definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal and like visual scripting vs actual coding being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldn t be able to do with visual scripting a shader,2
imo something thats extremely underrated especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on observer pattern is a must for game dev with larger projects having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects and it makes your code more modular each classgame object is its own self contained thing singleton and factory patterns as well as solid principles are also good to look into factory less so for unity since you can use getcomponent to retrieve references for things if youre using unity learn to use unity eventsc events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects,2
yes if you think you might want to add multiplayer coop you really should do it from the start suddenly you have to validate everything your players are saying they are doing along with replicating all the right properties without flooding the network and your animations and simulation has to be on point since players will be doing crazy things that ai just wouldnt we would give ai a pass on,1
i am still alive lol its going to take some more time but more devlogs will actually be coming also thanks for the crazy amount of support it means a lot,2
ive watched this video a bunch of times it really is so good only just realised i wasnt subbed,2
i would actually play this game for hours keep going,2
actually i have a plenty good options for the game those options are player has health points the turret has a field of view ai if it sees the player itll shoot health and power pickups airborne aerial targets such as drones heavy gunner drones scout drones etc ground targets such as beamshooting mechs enemy balls similar to the player but a little bit dumb and laser artilleries the tank can destroy the turret since the tank has the same weapons as the turret but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank grenadetype weapons and projectiles i meant by that which has new weapons to choose such as fullauto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire or just a singleshot grenade launcher similar to the m the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup the player can shut down the turrets system i hope this guy would see this,2
that looks so fun even though the movement is basic id love to fight that,2
i estimate this most definitely took over a month to make editing on point humor on point good shit,1
legion makes incredible game meoh boy can t wait to pl legion doesn t make a link to get this master piece,2
loved watching this i m glad i stumbled upon this on youtube world i watched this with my yr son and i see he loved it as well then we clicked to watch more videos and to our sad surprise you only had this video hope you kept at it and will put out more videos you can earn a nice living on youtube as well,2
for the stopping time there is a timetimescale property that you can use to stop your scripts and physicsautosimulation which stops physics such as falling cubes,1
subscribe so you dont miss the next devlog these were the legendary words of mythic legion before he disappeared,1
everyone will be sweating to earn that cent,1
i love the high quality of this series and how the team behind it is willing to give away more prize money than any other competition game show edit wow thanks for the likes,2
bro is giving away more than my entire net worth,0
cant wait for the cent competition though realistically that would be too expensive,1
i have been getting into game dev in the past year and really enjoy it and you are a big inspiration thank you,2
the game idea sort of reminds me of this game called checkpoint where in many of its levels you had to die to progress for example dying so you can walk over your dead body and avoid spikes,1
theme death is only the beginning benbonk makes elden ring,1
fun game excellent for hours seizure bug warning dont dash right in the code input room though you can break the game and if you keep dashing around you can cause the screen to start flashing enough to trigger seizures,2
i think the post processing added a lot of style to game made me realise the importance of post processing nice job great video,2
yoo this is actually a good game just gave it a try the concept is great,2
vimlark does a game engine run on gas me no it runs on human suffering,0
as someone who s interested in becoming a game dev this is really inspiring,2
that s it this is the last thing i really needed i m going to start my vr dev journey thankyou for the inspiration,2
you had me at i have anxiety to the point where i almost didnt go in even when i was sitting in the parking lot man do i know that feeling now try it with shortterm amnesia,0
anxiety to the point where i was considering not going to this meetup even when i was sitting in the parking lot of the venue i felt that hard good job making it happen,0
i know i might sound like a dreamer but i really want to make a historical medieval first person hack and slash game with total war commands like mordhau and bannerlord i know it s a huge stretch but that s the end goal hopefully some day i ll get there,2
this is one of the most inspiring videos ive ever watched thank you so much for this im new to the game design space and one of my biggest hurdles has been feeling overwhelmed about my lack of coding experience seeing your journey of how you went from no coding experience to being able to code a game by yourself at your first game jam really did something for me,2
as a gamedev who uses construct this is really inspiring,2
this is lovely to hear how you found a whole community and amazing that you spent so long persistently making stuff especially over a year of daily art i just discovered core but didn t realise it s a creation tool i haven t loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games i ve had an idea for a cat game for ages since i got three kittens last year and they re hilarious i don t suppose there s a basic cat model to edit i draw and paint some but the oomph goes too easily i just got back into gaming after a while and you saying i was a bored artist resonated i ve been wanting to do more with characters i was writing a story for too heck i even learned code a few years ago but my passion for websites waned and i found i didn t love battling all my errors enough to keep going so this all seems fun,2
the new dont explode looks so much better already even you have came a long way with pixel art and animation youre doing a great job,2
very inspiring for my own journey of learning unity so far ive been working on my own first project for days,2
your one of the best coders one youtube thanks for helping me on my journey,2
ive been in it for year and months back there i was crazy about game dev but getting far with learning i got lost tried a lot of technologies and because i was scared of not being able to get hired i got into javascript i dont have much knowledge here but react will be my main thing my heart is still in gamedev but it is very small amout of money in it and for living you need this money good luck to everyone reading my journey,1
hello i have been tremendously enjoying your devblog videos i can t wait to see the next i do have a question how are you creating your buildings within your world i just started creating my own top down game with tilemaps and have encountered numerous issues creating buildings with tilemaps i noticed that in the beginning of this video you are making buildings with the tiles that looks like a different program are you having better success utilizing that method of creating your world,2
i love the idea of this its a great way to see your progress when you usually dont see it,2
how did you learn so much in this short time i am learning unity since last month and just know how to move my player in the x and z coordinate,1
cool i hope you can do this full time someday,2
awesome d,2
nice video very inspiring and also handsome face,2
this motivates me,2
thanks so much for watchin guys and all your support remember you can get off d art pro plus d art pro free,2
ive experienced a fair amount of these mutations myself and i love the way you were able to convey your journey through the video i especially loved the bit about now youre the pizza guy the major trap is where i find my identity good stuff thomas keep it up,2
i really appreciate thought process videos pressing buttons on the mouse and keyboard isnt the difficult thing getting into the right mindset is the real beast thanks for this,2
thanks for sharing all this thomas its good to be aware of some of these pitfalls btw they also apply for things outside game development,2
i absolutely love of how you show the dark side of gamedev too and not just make all theese videos about how to make your game great it always makes it more relatable and helps with motivation for me keep up the great work,2
thanks thomas for being so transparent in your journey as a gamedev you level the playing field by showing us that the grass is not always greener on the other side you expose the struggles and show us encouraging ways to conquer the challenges along the way,2
completely agree with your points in mutation i am twice as good at codingdeveloping as i was last month and i have the urge to go back and fix things that i no longer deem worthy however i got to the point where i realized that just because i am better at in my craft doesnt mean that my old features are bad sometimes simplicity is key i think its about finding the right balance thank you again for sharing your insights thomas,2
i found myself in several of those steps and i was already working on solutions for each of those well done thomas for putting those feelings into words so clearly,2
dude i absolutely love the course and thanks for including the d art pro for free also thanks for being so inspiring and encouraging youve learned where the sweet spot is for making games and hit it every time you seek to educate thanks again,2
the same goes for all the careers and fields there are always pros and cons a riskfree life is the most dull and boring life,0
me show this to my parents my parents wowyou should work hard like him and become a doctor,2
super inspiring video theres also a huge misconception about pc spec for game dev or d i mean intel hd graphics will do for start no need to go rtx at day literally,2
thats a beautifull story bro congrats,2
coding is what got me through the lockdownlockdownskeeps the mind constantly occupied,2
i love how you stuck to your responsibilities while still going after your dream freaking inspiring man,2
david i didnt even know how to program still dont me as a programmer story of my life,0
my dev friend asked me to write story for his game im so stoked ive been dying to get into writing for games were working on an indie game now and this video is everything i need,2
i m and i love how when i was in high school it was thought of as impractical to become a game developer by most of our parents i remember being convinced that computer stuff is more of a hobby than something you can make a career out of and many of us believed them and decided to go to school for something else years later though some of us have finally decided to take the leap and make a career change for years i ve wanted to learn how to code but i always thought i wasn t smart enough to actually learn how so i never even tried until the end of last year now my only regret is that i didn t start learning years ago but i ve learned so much is this past year keep developing and creating great stories my friend,1
not gonna lie i had tears in my eyes what a wonderful story subscribed,2
im in the position starting out in film as well im very excited to embark on the game dev journey,2
tip make sure to like subscribe for more awesome game dev videos okayso maybe that was less of a tip and more of a suggestion,2
totally agree with writing readable code i just dont think and are the problem at all in my opinion if someone sees that as hard to read they should probably take a step back i think badinconsistent indentation confusing variable names repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often,0
these were lessons i had to learn the hard way over my four years of development thanks for getting this crucial tips out there for people starting out,2
my unofficial tip comment your code it makes it so much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes,2
great vid on the controversial tip i agree keep your code readable but id argue this is more about naming properties and functions and not cramming too much on one line replacing variable with variable false leans towards being overly verbose to me i would read variable as not variable personally but whatever makes it easier for you to understand your own code when coming back to it,2
a big tip i have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations as a coder its generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion if you have fun then power to you coding is a hobby after all but if youre just doing it to save those precious ms its not worth it by any means you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency,1
my reflexive advice for someone thats picking between art styles is err on the side of what you can crank out because you can more reliably finish that,1
on that readable code tip id refine that to say make sure you can read your own code in a game im currently working on ive added some variables that i could very easily get away without using the only reason i have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with also make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line it is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary to that end i will create empty methods if thats how my model works,2
never ever do this if boolean false is horrible form if an exclamation mark is really too difficult then just use the not keyword but please dont abuse comparison operators like that,0
these are great im working on my ansi ascii roguelike and i keep getting caught up in tiny details like changing the color of the player and enemies when theyre frozen or poisoned and tweaking the ui,2
start your free trial on gamemaker studio here thank you guys for watching the video,2
the fact that the second game developer was paid less than minimum wage is upsetting none of the artists were credited as well such a shame,0
the first game felt like a flash game the second felt like a full release and the third felt like one of those unity games with fun physics overall the thumbnail was not only clickbait but those poor devs were definitely heavily underpaid for their work i dont think i would be happy only giving them so little money for their work and not even giving them credit either,0
as a developer on fiverr i think all but especially the last shouldve gotten paid way more this takes at least a couple hours to build even for an experienced developer and fiverr takes of all your revenue thats not even half of minimum wage,1
thumbs up for the developers in your video thumbs down for you not giving them the exposure they deserve,1
i feel really sorry for whomever made the second game they sold themselves short i mean you dont owe it to the developer but it would be really cool if your worked with them to make it a full release if theyre interested also could you give these devs a shout out,1
i really really hope this gets backlash those devs deserved to be at least credited,1
second one was definitely the best honestly with a few updates to design ui and the background this could be a top tier mobile game the background could change to a crystal cavern at a higher lvl and the enemies could change later lvls,2
give each of the devs of the earnings by this video as bonus you still get to keep for the work they did without even getting credit for their work,1
the third game would have been a lot more interesting with one change the platforms are hexagons much smaller and with several more of them on screen at once so that youre always in danger of falling into a hole and not exactly sure where the path is going furthermore after reading several other comments i agree about crediting the developers however everyone needs to realise that the prices were agreed upon before development and the prices were integral to the experiment if the developers were not ok with the amounts they were paid then they wouldnt have accepted the job,1
opening blender for the first time is terrifying wheres the make finished d model button,0
when your game turned pink after the render pipeline switch that was supposed to happen it seemed like you had forgotten to change all of the materials to the new rp materials it should be somewhere in edit inside the rendering urp convert all materials sorry if im wrong though good video,1
i actually loled a few times watching this you perfectly described a persons first experiences with game dev and unity pretty well most peoples are worse than your experience because they have no programming experience and dont understand anything going on at all,0
you are very underrated your editing and game development skills are amazing when i watched ur video i have not looked at ur sub count and ii honestly though o was watching a channel that had over k subs if u keep this up you will get to million subs in no time,2
thats prob the best dev log i ever seen i see so much effort put into just one video like this one,2
you really know how to edit and create games hope you continue youtube you are very under rated,2
congrats man you are going places great editing and content got a new subscriber,2
underrated youtuber i really like this editing style and it never gets boring,2
hahaha great stuff i lost it when you coded coroutine for the enemy death instead of doing it properly which is not that hard such a nice workaround good job d,2
you have probably learned this by now but in your animator on unity you can make an event somewhere in the animation so when you reach a certain point in the animation you can trigger a function im not very good at english hope you understood me,1
step just start doing it and dont put it off most of this stuff is free like unity blender and audacity no reason to wait,2
im an unreal dev and the way i see engines is that they are tools pick the one that suit your needs and stick to it even change them if you need to i dont understand the war between unity and unreal i chose unreal because my favorite game gears of war was made in using it and also i saw a timelapse of a guy creating a stellar scene in unreal plus unreal was more shiny looking so my dumb ass just went with it,1
when copypasting code its important to know what youre writing try to understand what each line does it helps troubleshooting and learning,1
for all the new indie devs use which ever game engine you feel comfortable with unity godot gamemaker and yes unreal be persistent and make lots of games can make your dream game or side project,2
freecheaper alternatives krita instead of ps blender default one affinity or inkscape for vector art asprtie for pixel art,1
i use unity every day and its great its like an allrounder game engine unreal is more of a d artistfocused engine so choose unity if youre more of a programmer and want to make crossplatform and various games choose unreal if you only want to make d games and youre more of an artist if youre still not sure just go with unity,2
ive only worked in unity once to do a codealong game that brackey did a series on but i plan on learning both so i can choose whichever suits my needs better i feel like both have their pros and cons from the sound of it,1
hi thomas brush im brad fry and i work as a self employed flooring and installer and want to make games for a living haha your intro inspired me to write that but all jokes aside im and have kids and my own business well solo contractor your videos have really given me the feeling i could at least learn to develop games despite the limited time keep up the good work,2
thomas is back to the old content i m overwhelmed with nostalgia,2
hey all most of the models used in the vid were created by synty studios they found my channel and reached out as a potential sponsor as i love using their assets it was an easy yes so if you want to get any synty assets for yourself check out my affiliate link to support the channel,2
i thought this video was very professionally made i was surprised when i got to the end and saw your subscriber count you definitely deserve more great work on some really good looking games,2
ive watched a few how i started game dev my game dev xx year journey vids and this is by far the best one not the funniest one but definitely the most humble straight forward and informative,2
you got me in the first minute not seeing friends i don t have and looking at unity no idea what i was looking at exactly my feeling,0
the quality of what you achieved so far is amazing tourney manager gave me tons of mount blade vibes,2
this is pretty insightful and inspiring also great progress keep it up,2
proud of your journey man it takes a great deal of discipline to start something new and stick it out i think i bought your latest project tavern master on steam a couple months ago and i thought it was pretty decent keep at it only upwards from here,2
the production quality of this video is too high for the amount of subscribers you have this channel will grow exponentially if you keep this up great work and very inspirational stuff,2
hello from a fellow dev you have done so much in those two years ive been at this for years and feel like ive done less even though i have a game already out there in open beta excellent video quality editting very promising youtube channel,2
this is inspiring i wish i had kept up my momentum with learning unity subbed now ill binge the rest of your content,2
you make me feel motivated to make another game that i will never finish,1
when i was and thought of developing my own game i was so overwhelmed by the code i ended up quitting you are so talented i m gonna stick to playing video games lmao,2
the fact you even thought the robot saw himself as the hero for fighting pollution is really mesmerizing probably a kind of game id be interested if released on steam great evolution in your projects btw,2
great job accomplishing so much when you were so young its great to see how many different genres you tried too would love to see what you are working on currently,2
wow most of your games can be combined into one huge game just imagine a bunny shooting while on top on a plane,2
damn you were one hell of a year old developer,0
you can really tell the progress awesome especially the logic behind the last one with the cars its something that can get you in a tesla like company to code the actual self driving cars so keep up the good work,2
i d love to see a multiplayer fps remake,2
damn this is actually insanely cool even the really simple ones are really interesting,2
this inspired me to look into making games the coding looks so intense though is it difficult,2
make sure to smash that subscribe button for games wings and better special effects than the last airbender movie what special effects do you want to see next,2
im glad you didnt show yourself eating salads and drinking starbucks of the time but actually showed your work great content subbed,2
working on your job working on your own dreamsmanaging a youtube channel and spending time with the family mad respect bro definitely got my sub,2
found the channel today through reddit admirable to see people who do full time work and find discipline and will to work on something else like a game on the side also how can i horizontally center a div is a classic haha,2
dude its amazing how much you were able to balance so many things in your daily life i envy it,2
thats awesome man i wish you the best of luck for your games im still young but i really wanna be a game designer when ill be older so watching that kind of videos gives me more hope to achieve what i want,2
love seeing people do what they really enjoyed doing thumbs up,2
once again amazing stuff i m proud and confident to say that i m here before you blow up well edited well paced and well shot even with a meh camera i know you re going to succeed keep at it,2
this was super refreshing to watch thanks for this i work in retail and i m currently working on a fighter and i recently got all of my characters working i m glad game dev is just fun for you cheers,2
this dude has a dream setup but then a family reunion lawn chair thats the definition of i can do what i want,2
yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to d games by learning d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,0
so i did some googling and with a bit of time i learned quantum theory and i am speaking to you through the threads of a black hole,1
unity and unreal both have un in them but if we remove un we get real and ity which makes reality,1
you learned to do all this in a week and i spent a whole month trying to make a sprite sheet for a d game,1
can we appreciate how he made functional games in days with one being vr,2
steven learned everything in a week me learns how to make a cube in a month,1
this video taught me to spend way too much time on ragdolls when making a d game,0
this guys humour is a gift to humanity,2
me this will be fun hr later why isnt the camera rotating,2
its crazy how inspiring and good this guy is a game maker is born if i had the option i would put your game game of the year or decade,2
the first talk was great solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation eg it might be faster to first deal with the most complex problem but making small wins working on art or marketing along the way helps you to stay motivated,2
was amazing to be involved in this hopefully you all can get some good nuggets out of it along with being more prepared for the hidden pitfalls,2
the talks were good but their personal reflections were amazing we really put these guys on a pedestal but we tend to ignore the emotional impact of solo development the gratification when the project is finished is amazing but the journey there definitely seems like a rollercoaster,2
this is actually insanely important and probably underrated advice there was a time in my life where i ended up stifling all of my random ideas in the name of higher priorities and it unwittingly spiraled me into years of burnout and depression this is all in retrospect because at the time i thought i was doing the right thing but its extremely clear to me now that you need to give yourself the freedom to create and explore eventually youll find the balance of how much time you should set aside for those tangents and sometimes those tangents turn out to be a core part of your final work sometimes they turn out to be nothing too but dont be discouraged just have fun overall i loved all of these speakers really excellent session,1
independent developers should bookmark this cursed problems in game design also hosted by gdc of the best imo,2
the common refrain is to use temp assets to prototype gameplay and systems so that you dont waste time remaking assets if systems demand it it sounds like for solo devs accepting that risk is worth the boost in confidence that having art first grants,1
i had my second project planned before releasing the first game which helped me skip that depressing stage after releasing theres really no happiness at the end of the road no matter how many sales you make so gotta enjoy the adventure and hop on the next one right away,2
such a great and relevant session each of the panelists had a ton of valuable insights to offer thank you,2
im absolutely stunned how much emotional i got with this speeches kind of like in the last public question im also doing a board game and im happy to hear that games take extremely long to port and that it is a rollercoaster of emotions and full of pitfalls to watch out for but as long as i keep looking back at my younger self who started my streamers ace project i cant make him sad and quit thanks for that amazing talk and all your effort you all put into it,2
i love how they all highlight different spectrum of solo development,2
i have to ask how do you line up the monitor camera transitions so well xd is it really just holding the camera precariously at an angle that lines up the monitor bezels and then moving it out so well done,2
as a dev i liked that small insight into the code and class implementations would be up to see more of that in future,2
you motivated me to start being more orderly to have plants and to eat healthier i really like your routine and im trying to improve mine as well soon i will also enter patreot i really appreciate what you are doing,2
i love these calm relaxing devlogs keep it up dd,2
i feel like enjoying your healthy daily routine more than the coding part xd i like how you mix designing modeling coding and life style content in your dev logs great content,2
your videos are such a treat to watch always excited when a new one is posted keep up the good work the game is really coming along nicely,2
this game feels way better to me now that youve chilled out the tool usage a really good and subtle change to the vibe,2
your meals look divine the game is progressing nicely,2
idea you could have the pathways act as barriers making it harder or impossible for weeds to spread thus giving you a reason to separate farm plots and giving the path tiles a function,1
great update love your focus on the little details that ensure this game will be a relaxing experience for players on an unrelated note i look forward to the day when i can eat dinner without my puppy needing to go in the crate p,2
bro i am so glad i discovered your channel these videos are gem not only entertaining but they also highly motivate me to start with unreal engine thanks,2
damn next time i wanne be the one to test out your epic games,1
every single game has to have an assault rifle tf i have no such weakness,1
your channel is such an inspiration to us slow methodical developers struggling to finish overcomplicated projects to try new things,2
wow you have videos and managed to gain over k subscribers that is truly impressive and shows how good your content is,2
i would love a multiplayer classic doom type of game that would be dope,2
it was quite funny bro loved it also got some level design ideas for my very first game thank you so much,2
hell yeah dude although i would recommend it gets exposure and be free for sometime the reason is well you re a small dev and you gotta gain a following and give good feedback to your customers and its an initial experimental stage,2
if you ever want to release this please make the shotgun range realistic,1
hey just wondering did you use the default sessions for the multiplayer or some other plugin would be handy to know because the default sessions i think are only lan and loopback and ive tried that steam plugin but that doesnt work out great also good video,0
go to and use code hmw to get off clickups massive unlimited plan for a year start reclaiming your time for less than a month hurry offer ends soon,2
microtransactions are really soiling the gaming experience imo everything is quickly becoming a subscription,0
save you minutes games as a service are vastly more profitable than the initial revenue from games,2
the reason triple aaa games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design theyre treating what were supposed to be enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly you cant just create another gta v every single year that shit takes a lot of time,0
another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control business just wont allow that much money to be spent on an experiment everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey uncreative bland games that look really nice,0
when some people say games from older generations were better i must agree as a kid i imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics but sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored its hard to find triple a titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay win features thats why im revisiting emulation indie games and a few aaa titles which are worth the money and also the playtime,2
ive been telling my friends this for the past couple years we are going to see fewer aaa games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the preexisting games as well there is just so much competition in this industry,0
here is my issue with this aaa game companies are trying too hard to make the biggest game big being best graphics biggest worlds widest variety be in customization weapons vehicles etc which will need lots of people and technology naturally which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects except when you have games like undertale minecraft before microsofts purchase goosegame goat simulator powerwash simulator etc getting loads and loads of sales when theyre developed by small teams these games are very basic graphically have a very short play time minecraft an exception no big budget no fancy effects no extraordinary acting but just simple fun heck id be willing to consider undertale a masterpiece and its a very short game players dont want big they want good yes the newer games look pretty but i promise best graphics isnt necessarily what gamers are aftee best graphics should be icing on the cake not the whole cake,1
fair to say the golden age of gaming is truly gonesad reallybut glad i grew up gaming in the s and early ssad a lotta kids wont experience the magic we did,1
it s awful sad to see how stuff goes to thrash when the general public gets access look at youtube itself with its mandatory ad friendly content social media taking over everything lack of variety due to companies milking winning formulas dry game companies noticing that the casual player is not demanding quality at all it sucks,0
i remember freshman year when you would be working on your games in class cool to see how far you ve come with it,2
glad to have found your channel this gives me a lot of insight im kinda feeling the i dont even like animating thing right now and wondering wtf else i can put those skills towards,1
i hope one day to be able to look back at your progress as greatly as you have been able super hyped for the release,2
the journey from not understanding what an if statement is to having a complete game is always awe inspiring to look back on hopefully well see some cool projects in unreal engine at somepoint,2
great video its awesome how far youve come and to see such a positive attitude with game dev keeping things realistic is always best,2
great vid man was nice to see how your game dev journey began good luck on the next project,2
even though i just got a recommendation from this channel i am proud of your pursuit for your passions,2
super happy to see how far you ve come being your friend getting to come over and see your progress has always been so much fun can t wait to keep seeing your progress,2
just keep trying to improve everyday words to live by,2
hey i recently discovered your channel and i just wanna say im practicing many things that i am passionate about and your channel is a big inspiration just hope you know youre making good influences,2
entertaining video man tho,1
dude the algorithm has blessed me with this wonderful video you earned a new sub,2
woah ive never met somebody so underrated your sense of humour is immaculate mixed with politeness and a good amount of jokes the way you explain everything so crisply and manage to fit it all in in just a minute long video is surprising keep up the good content o,2
dani is literally the reason ive started game dev he might not realize this but hes inspired alot of people including me and karlson is literally my dream gamemainly because i grew up playing mirrors edge and other parkour games,2
underrated i agree he s extremely good at game development but he also has millions of subscribers millions more viewers and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm not to mention karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions and one of the most wishlisted games on steam many other solo gamedevs out there who pour just as much if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i d call underrated there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like dani i m not saying it s his fault or anything i watch him and support him i m just saying the claim that he s underrated let alone the most underrated is incredibly wrong as far as i m concerned,2
he ain t overrated not underrated he s a extremely brilliant developer who is wellrated,2
at first i thought this was going to be a bad retelling of danis history video but instead it talked about things after that and indepth telling of crab game and muck that was pretty entertaining keep doing what youre doing in a few years you will with no doubt have million if you keep it up,2
dani def isn t the most underrated game dev he has millions of subs front page steam games and so many people know who he is,1
good video wouldnt agree with the title though since well hes one of the most popular indie devs out there with an audience of over million on youtube and the free games he put on steam being orders of magnitude bigger than even successful games but hey titles are titles it didnt really get driven on particularly much in the video,2
such amazing content creator definitely needs more support you earned a subscriber hoping for more nice content,2
that desk would ve taken me at least days to draw,0
this is one of my fav videos from you lately i loved seeing more of your late development process i ll be building my gaming pc soon aswell so i m really hype for the launch of monster tower lmao,2
nice video reece im always impressed by the cool and unique videos ideas you think of,2
this game looks fkng great i love those kinds of games like go and explore by yourself no one will stop u and says hey go here and here,2
awesome way to beat procrastination d im barely even keeping a todo list with my current project i have a list with tasks are done lol hopefully this will inspire me to be more organized because it will speed up my development youve inspired me as always reece and ive only been awake mins d,2
hey reece this is a really cool and unique video idea and great execution love the insights and entertainment i got here since i could also totally relate to all the time consuming tasks of game dev usually i calculate for everything x the time i write down because it usually takes longer and unexpected things start to happen always,2
the part of estimating the time needed reminds me of the agile development method of estimating so called story points to tasks to put them in relation to each other compared to the size and complexity,1
that was anticlimactic love the video though great idea to challenge yourself and get yourself motivated again,2
its so hard not to crunch during game dev big ups for this,2
the game is looking great really interesting challenge too since you drew i suggest a rematch to find a true winner,2
im just finishing up a computer science degree and i really want to get into video game development i play indie games almost constantly and i love the idea of making something of my own that i myself and other people can enjoy but i keep holding myself back because im scared and dont know where to start this video was definitely helpful and inspiring to me and it makes me feel like i actually have a shot at gaining the skills i need and making something cool,2
hi great video really gave some helpful insights im currently in university studying computer science as every single company in my city said its a requirement but im also going to be working on my own projects hopefully i can skip the stage of being employed and start my own company we can dream haha but yeah this has been helpful the information was concise and well presented good job and thank you,2
my dream since i was like is to work for rockstar i hope i get there one day,2
i was considering about joining a coding bootcamp program for possible game dev applications and job fittings afterwards most bootcamps i have come across are primarily web development for tech companies and job placement with companies like google apple etc are there any game dev bootcamps similar to those do they have a high percentage hire rate within so many months after completing their program,1
these videos are really helpful i watch them with my friends on voicely whenever we practice coding we all agree that we learned more from youtube videos than from school lol,2
bro i just learned that the college im planning on attending next year also has japanese courses which ive wanted to do since middle school combining that with game development could lead me to working for a japanese developer like fromsoftware,2
i like the nods to fanboyism in this presentation i was unlucky that in my college years you generally only had option in it which were basically programming for databases and networking while i specifically went to learn coding and graphics designing to create games i learned the graphics part on my own also because i had a real knack and passion for it coding was more difficult as information to code for gaming or even a gameengine were hard to come by or expensive now almost decades further our country finally is getting a gamingindustry and there are classes you can follow i hope i can start in september and hopefully theyre not too basic as i already have some basics i already tried creating a game twice sort of first time was more than a decade ago supposed to be a fighting game or beatem up i got my character modelled not textured and even rigged for facial animation but i soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do so much to consider and take into account and there wasnt even a decent free engine that could provide what i needed two years ago i started again but with another genre i liked and more manageable for a single game dev an arcade racer luckily i was able to pick up blender easily where i left of they also made it more userfriendly and found a decent free gameengine godot atleast good enough to give me the taste of gamecreation and create a tiny concept i have some videos on my gamedev channel close call racingon channel eyeemotion i have been on a break from it because of renovations at home which i have to execute myself and im changing to unreal engine since its change in licensing and its more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming i just need that gamedev year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when i get stuck and the information i need,1
thanks to ricch dawg for being there for me when i truly needed strong support you made this degree happen for me by arranging digit credit card info for me to be able to do the payment have been struggling for,2
i was thinking about becoming a game developer who primarily creates code as a hobby i dont like the art side of it i figure i would rather download sprites from websites and use those for a d indie game i am learning javascript and i was thinking about using threejs and javascript for creating a nice small d game maybe for mobile and importing it to reactnative i am guessing this will take me another months of learning javascript before i am able to program my first small game i am learning javascript for web development but i think i will at the end pivot into mobile development,1
hi there this was a great video that has told me exactly what i need to know could you recommend some groupscommunities that accept someone with no experience at all i have a physical version of my game and i know the rules inside and out i have learnt how to draw digitally and am transferring the art into a format that can be used in the game i want to make and a community that is welcoming and that gives feedbackadvie would be awesome,2
bruh i write how to make a game engine and get a fucking adventure video,0
unreal engine left the chat,0
unity oh lets sponsor this guy he makes games in our engine n dev i made my own game engine,1
pretty brave of unity to sponsor their competitor great stuff,2
just imagine how cool a game engine jam would be,2
really like the editing can def tell a lot of effort was put in,2
editing is on point with this one but unitys taking a huge risk sponsoring its competitor,1
the simple idea of making a game engine from scratch is just too impressive for my tiny brain to comprehend,2
can t help but notice n is only k away from k i m referring to the fact that you should subscribe,1
yo this video is so good my guy i love how you used after effects for the entire editing process but for real incredible work glad to have my face featured also,2
download gamemaker for free,1
maybe he could have a pet wolf with a revolver in its mouth that follows him around and when you right click the wolf shoots in that direction and can hit an enemy,1
babe quick milkmansteve just uploaded,1
you could give him a revolver that shoots but in a limited range similar to the swords range cool video btw,2
i feel like the older model could still work fine if you made him look more closely to a blob around the face area and just had a bigger emphasis around the face,2
cant wait to see how it turns out looks sick so far,2
look into how nuclear throne does attack animations it simply teleports the sword from one side of the player to the other while creating a separate slash object which slowly dissipates i ve used this technique in my current roguelike and it works amazingly well,2
sword have the sword be static on his back or in a side holster then animating attacks that way possibly do both gun floating revolver controlled via mouse shoot with left click and can do a charged shot with right click going this route could make the game too easy though sword and gun do a side holster sword as mentioned above and have a revolver mentioned above that charges with the damage done to the boss edit remember i am smooth brained so may not be good ideas,1
i ve always wanted to make a game and i ve come up with many ideas for it but i ve never been committed enough to actually learn game development glad to see you pulling through and learning it keep up the great work also what if for a hit floating sword combo you swing it overhead for the first hit and for the second attack the sword flings out and spins in a circle,2
i always tend to make my main characters cute and small it makes it easier for the players to get attached to them so as far as audience feedback goes at least one dude likes the new design as for animations with floating hands most of my characters have floating hands like yours but mainly use ranged weapons limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off so dont be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it if youre not too attached to the melee combat why not focus on ranged instead kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side,2
my name is len thanks for building an island for me,2
the artwork looks absolutely fantastic that is a huuuge selling point for a game like this people that like really chill games will love that if the dungeons are cool enough for players who like a good diablo grind youll have a game that appeals to a huge variety of players,2
yoo thanks for this it teaches soo much im a noob and have a dream and idea of eventually creating my own game if it takes me yrs and only my friends play it doesnt matter i will do it,2
hi julian i love your game so far and am obsessed with the art style of it all i am from california with a bachelors degree in english and wanted to see if you needed a writer to develop the world lore or whatever storycampaignquestsdialogue you want to bring into lens island i dont have a portfolio since i am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you and if you like it then we could look into working together i will write anything and everything for your game free for a full year and will sign an nda to protect your work either way i wish you all the best and thank you for your time logan,2
i m not a game designer i do have a degree in game design,1
when you cant find a game that has everything you want you make it yourself lol,1
been following this project for ages and im always blown away by the attention to detail in the level design super excited to see where the game goes from here,2
seems like a pretty large scope to launch this december,2
the game is looking awesome when i first saw your videos about your studentprojectgame and your new project it motivated me to work harder and now i am in gamedesign school myself thank you a lot for the motivation however i think it might be good to add some impact to trees and rocks when hit like a little shake as of right now the only indication you hit the rocktree is the popup text and that is not really satisfying not that its bad the way it is right now just as feedback,2
its so aesthetic definitely my favourite aspect is the versatility one has when playing if one didnt want to dungeon crawl they could create amazing buildings etc and vice versa,2
ive listed the links to all the free software mentioned in the video ill be updating it frequently with your recommendations as well make sure the check out the description for the full list,1
love the video goodgis having used bfxr in the past im gonna check out labchirp now xd here are a few i didnt see in the video but i think are worth a mention graphicsgale pixel art krita foss raster art sunvox music tracker petaporon simple piano roll sequencer famistudio chiptune music famitracker chiptune music tracker chiptone sound effects,2
the one thing i think you really missed here in the raster editing section is krita which is especially useful for creating tiling textures as well as having a really powerful painting workflow,2
for d art i personally use krita its free and pretty neat its good with animation too,2
adding this to my learn how to gamedev playlist,1
really well put together video loved the editing as always and i feel that the topic you picked up on today is one that not many people do touch upon but is incredibly essential i know ive been developing games for over years now and over one year with unity really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a perfect video as always good job ps almost to k,2
i would just like to say that audio software wise you have saved me so much research thank you for making this video and keep up the great work,2
i know that you cant get into it in a short video but the political philosophy behind foss is fascinating in many ways foss or at least its driving philosophies predate proprietary software,2
other alts raster krita it also kind of supports vector music lmms,1
actually all unity tools are available in the free version you only need to pay when you exceed dollars per year there are no limits,2
i like a and c b may be good for caves,2
press m to merge two or more points in blender its rly useful also nice vid d,2
quick idea the player is able to construct a mastership between islands with customizable elements that shehe can bring back from exploration,1
i got a cool idea maybe have space pirate raids on your ship in order to keep track of them you would need to use your ships cameras to see where they are heading possibly trying to cut off specific parts of the ship with doors in order to allow you to get there in time to take them out if there is combat they could probably take a couple slots per chest if they get to it then retreat to their ship maybe its always flying next to your ship while you are being raided this could make flying through the world pretty dangerous as at any point pirates could come and raid you maybe there could be a whole security system that enemies have to get passed or maybe they could cut your power in half making you unable to escape until all are gone it could really make the game incredibly fun,1
this is awesome ive been working on mine for nearly two years now its crazy difficult to keep motivated but i always found myself coming back to get work done my game releases next month and i cant wait youve been doing it longer though i respect you for the sheer amount of motivation youve had to keep up and for starting a project this big,2
this game has come a very long way and is looking amazing good job so far me too is working on a d survival game and it is quite fun,2
those models look great i love the style also a fan of the editing,2
this looks awesome man i love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool keep up the good work and thanks for the video,2
the progress is looking super awesome and impressive also spending years behind a single project shows dedication really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying for the enemies a b and c i actually like all of them you could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player you could use blenders merge by distance to merge the vertex i just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one saves lot of time keep it up,2
the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great d i wish i could make even one d model lol x i subscribed,2
its really bold of you to ditch the safety of your masters degree to pursue your indie dev career truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats i hope more indie devs do their sales overview it helps aspiring game devs like me to gauge whats realistic and whats not when it comes to running a oneman studio,2
dude thats awesome also making a game every months aint so bad youre officially in the business now i cant wait to one day join the rest of you,2
to engagement metrics also after a year of it being up it would be cool to do a follow up video to see the life span of the game,2
i appreciate you explaining the logistics of game development it simply is something done out of passion,2
i usually dont leave good comments but youre a pretty funny guy good personality and its a shame that somebody so smart made very little on a really cool game like that i hope it becomes much more successful shout out to all the underdog nerds out there who dont get what they truly deserve,2
the video was engaging and entertaining i think continuing this level of quality regardless of topic is probably gonna get your channel to some serious viewership in the future you seriously deserve more subs than what you have just keep doing what you re doing thanks for the video,2
dude thats awesome its a lot of money dont knock yourself down over it its nice seeing a small indie dev become successful,2
the amount of hardwork you put in your video i cant say you are amazing,2
i love how transparent and motivating you are keep it up im supporting u,2
actually doesnt the tax during purchase count towards your final tax amount and you can use creative ways to spend the money so your llc doesnt make any profit by the end of the year,1
subscribe also follow me on twitch,2
you should add a playground for the seekers while they wait to be released a mini jungle gym or something like that so they wont be bored while waiting the seconds,1
a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well you can recolor it different times to milk it as much as possible im very exited to see this games future so good luck,2
you should add a taunt ability for the hiders that plays a monkey sound the seekers can hear it the hiders can taunt manually but every mins it automatically taunts because it is still really easy to hide from the seekers,1
an idea for the rock skins maybe you can make them the gemstones in the cave and make them unlockable by interacting with the gemstones down there sounds pretty neat,2
to be honest man this was actually pretty good it has a nice friendly yet also slightly cursed in a good way feeling to it,2
personally i think adding a way for the seekers to set bananas as traps that would show the location of a hider that triggers it might be cool,2
i have a suggestion for a mechanic that can be easily implemented into this game in a potential update i suggest making the cannons functional allowing the hides and the seekers to launch themselves across the map using the cannons,1
suggestion maybe instead of giving away the locations of the hiders after a period why not force to hiders to make monkey noises instead,1
you should make an button in controls setings go crazy that randomizes your controls dont forget the reset controls too,1
summary machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data there are lots of different ways algorithms that machines can learn the algorithms can be grouped into supervised unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be inputoutput pairs or just inputs supervised learning algorithms require inputoutput pairs ie they require the output unsupervised learning requires only the input data not the outputs here is how in general supervised algorithms work you feed it an example input then the associated output you repeat the above step many many times eventually the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs now you can feed it a brand new input and it will predict the output for you here is how in general unsupervised algorithms work you feed it an example input without the associated output you repeat the above step many times eventually the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups now you can feed it a brand new input and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with the first example in this video used the knearest neighbor algorithm which is a supervised machine learning algorithm hope that was useful to someone thanks for the video really enjoyed it,1
scenario facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs explanation it is supervised learning here facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person therefore the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data it is supervised learning scenario recommending new songs based on someone s past music choices explanation it is supervised learning the model is training a classifier on preexisting labels genres of songs this is what netflix pandora and spotify do all the time they collect the songsmovies that you like already evaluate the features based on your likesdislikes and then recommend new moviessongs based on similar features scenario analyze bank data for suspiciouslooking transactions and flag the fraud transactions explanation it is unsupervised learning in this case the suspicious transactions are not defined hence there are no labels of fraud and not fraud the model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as fraud,1
wonderful and fantastic tutorial its really helpful the explanation is so clear thumb up to the tutor,2
loved the videoits very informative and insightful under mins quiz answers st and nd are supervised while rd is unsupervised,2

the best training i had seen till now on youtube no adds no waste of time very detail,2
thanks a lot for this course can you explain the relation between inferential statistics and neural network models both can be used for predicting outcomes please do explain me in detail,2
dear edureka this is one of the finest videos i have seen that has really helped me prepare well for my campus placement process,2
thank you so much edureka can the datasets and the codes used by the instructors be shared also it would be great to have some sort of notes of the tutorial if those can be shared as well thanks again,2
really resourceful this course helped get up to speed on the subject thank you edureka,2
im up to hours into the video so far excellent teaching looking forward to the last partsthank you,2
get and start running workloads for free,1
i love how well you break this down into small understandable bits excellent work,2
great job explaining the concepts simple and effective communication,2
the explanation is fantastic thank you for your work,2
nice explanation for the first time in minutes i have understand what is machine learning thank you waiting for more tutorials videos,2
these are awesome set of videos really like the fact that they are well structured and concise,2
excellent instructor thank you so much,2
four years later and this is so instructional thank you for the video,2
im just starting out and i liked this video interesting to learn about machine learning applications like image recognition fraud detection and recommendation systems that we see on google search and next video recommendations on youtube also interesting to know about predictive models and that data is used to train the model to serve predictions which results in answering questions good one,2
i like indices gathering data preparing data model selection training evaluation parameter tuning prediction,2
im amazed how a complex topic could be explained seamlessly great video,2
having just studied machine learning and coding for it this is a great simple and logical explanation in common conversation well done,2
very informative video thanks for explaining a fairly complicated subject in a simple explanation that makes sense,2
i have watched many videos now and this was the best for ai beginners imo thank you,2
it is great lecture and explains the topic very clearly and simplyi will follow all the videos because comparing to other programs and books this the most clear videos i ve seen so far,2
thank you i am new to the it industry and i found your explanation very easy to digest especially from a lay persons pov,2
i love how he explained the steps of machine learning in simplified plain english thank you very much,2
very clearly explained thank you so much mr guo,2
i love these videos i just had a tech exec at a fortune company ask me for any podcasts that could help him stay abreast of currentemerging technology i didnt have a great answer for him but i did mention this series he was looking for more audiocentric content though food for thought ibm technology,2
so i do like this series but this confused me because he switched from one output should i buy pizza to another output is this a pizza or a taco is this a fundamental difference in what dl vs ml is able to do or that the first output doesnt require as many layers to become a neural network so therefore would always sit at a dl level sorry i think i need to do more study and come back to this video,1
funfilled tech bites loved it,2
i dont completely agree on deep learning explanation because for weight training labelling is required yes patternfeature extraction can be debated but labelled data is required,0
academically speaking should ai not be a subset of dl i think you ve done a commercial magic trick here,1
nice loved it,2
good one,2
you did well explaining mate no idea what they re talking about,1
so complicated please make every thing more simple,1
where are all the neurons weights and biases stored in ram in a database what datastructure is used,1
hi everyone i hope that everyone will enjoy this course heres how you can help me be sure to subscribe newera for further courses a brand new deep learning course is coming on newera so after completing ml you can watch that too you can watch the same course here all the updates announcements will be made here only you can know more or connect with me on social media handles below an intro video about me linkedin instagram twitter discord to ask question antern anternco,2

the whole course is so comprehensive thank you this hours of knowledge tsunami actually represents a higher quality of teaching than some university courses in the same topic d,2
having done machine learning in the past year this was actually a really good revision,2
i have a little question in the whole calculation of rmse in linear regression why are we addting m instead of multiplying it by m even if we consider the units of the entities we are trying to add a number with distance,1
perfect example of age doesnt matter if you have knowledge nicely done bro,2
now a fetus teaching quantum mechanics please,1
this course is the best i ve ever seenheard explaining the concepts of machine learningdeep learning just simply awesome mit students are really lucky to have this professor makes me wish to be a college student again,2
sir good evening i am not related to this subject but your way of explaining subject matter is excellent you are lecturer from top most institute in the world so i love to watch way of teaching process methods and dealing with subject topicsyour attitude and way of dealing contents is very simplecongratulations sir,2
i thank mit for uploading such a valuable videos to the world will definitely make a donation to mit after i got my dream job i can listen to this teacher hours continuously the way he spread words and his character,2
this is god level content wow i want to salute this man for explaining complex ideas in such simple terms no wonder mit grads learn so well i can only wish,2
i dont always like his sense of humor but this is an excellent lecture by professor eric grimson,2
this is how you teach students awesome explanations without the explanation of the fundamental terminologies as he is doing here machine learning becomes boring to learn,0
i think that eric is a tremendous teacher really enjoy watching him explain stuff,2
what an amazing video so easy to understand thank you so much,2
i can listen to this teacher hours continuously the way he spread words and his character,2
i thank mit for uploading such a valuable videos to the world,2
regards awesome explanation,2
as a person who has selflearned a bit of python and is just trying to learn this stuff this is exactly the best place to begin,2
one like is not enough for the work that has gone into making one such video this video should be part of the curriculum and he should get the royalty for this awesome work,2
this video kickstarted my journey in ml a year back trust me back then i watched this video three times to finally understand it might be challenging for few to get it but when you get it it just feels amazing,2
im in my first year of engineering looking to go into cs and this video makes me extremely excited for my coming education ive already watched so many of your videos and theyve all had a similar effect thank you so much,2
i study mathematics physics and architecture by definition this man is an oracle in the strict meaning of the word with all honesty i never imagined someone explaining complex topics with the dexterity this man has he is literally an institution and an outstanding teacher the computer graphics and the illustrations are simply perplexing this guy never evades complexity he never evades complex arguments he illustrate the complexity and dive into the exhaustive explanation of the details its extremely rare to see a professor and a dedicated user to put a lot of effort explaining animating and describing mathematics the way he does,1
i am just astounded i spent so much time trying to understand this concept everywhere i looked people would show the similar neural network animation but no one ever really explained and exemplified every single step layer term and mathematics behind it the video is really well structured and with amazing animations extremely well done my mind is so blown i can barely write this comment,2
i have a question here for example if that is a part around the this part is a certain amount of pixels in the square it looks like you always have to write the numbers in the middle so that the network recognizes this is it possible that you write a on the far right or on the left or on the top or bottom and the network recognizes that anyway,1
i am programming for more than ten years and i never saw anyone explain a complex idea by such a clean and clear terms well done,2
thank you so much for the visualizations i think if math teachers always refer to how it pictorially looks the intuition would be easier to get this is why you and dr strang from mit have good content,2
finally ml thank you so much i would be interested in a beyond sec or more short vids in this topic keep it up,2
you know every time i want to learn some new framework or language i come here for your seconds series every time you manage to explain whats important about a topic in barely minutes which drives people like me to want to learn more love your vids editing today was as always,2
i still dont get how you can push out so much content with high quality so oftenquickly well done once again,2
i love the little bits of humour that you inject into the images without acknowledging them in your audio so good,2
finally i can add machine learning specialist to my portfolio,2
finally the best explanation of ml in seconds has landed on earth this is possible only with fireship,2
should be sets train test and validation you can t truly judge accuracy based on testing set alone you need unseen data to prove there wasn t overfitting there are also techniques like cross validation that you can use when you don t have enough data to make sets,1
definitely more machine learning content on this channel id love to dive into it with your help,2
i would love some more content on machine learning great video as always,2
i love this content and the concise nature in which its delivered,2
she is such a good teacher never knew machine leaening and ai could be this interesting,2
carrie ann i want to thank you for bringing so much enthusiasm to the topic this is exciting stuff but it can be shown in a very static and boring way and you dont do that,2
i love how the code was placed right next to the decision tree it was so simple to understand the tree and with the code right next to the branches i felt the same simplicity merge over as i looked at the code definitely a smart way to relieve the anxiety of trying to figure out a new code seeing this makes me think that if kids are exposed to math and science examples like this in programming courses or even in after school activities theyd be even more adaptable to learning how to code you guys are amazing please keep the videos coming,2
my whole ai semester in almost minutes,1
the most fascinating part about deepminds alphazero is that it did not need humancreated training data it only needed to play itself enough times and by sheer volume become a master humans cant do that unfortunately,2
as part of a plant anatomy class many years ago we did field measurements to determine whether a population of trees in a particular canyon represented two distinct species or showed evidence of interbreeding i never saw the results of the analysis of that data but it should have looked very much like some of whats presented in this video,1
i would really love to see a crash course series on the practical skills that scientists need ie latex soldering writing a research paper advanced lab skills etc,2
as someone aiming to double major in entomology and computer science this video is right up my alley love the example chosen for this episode,2
as a newcomer to machine learning this was a great overview thank you,2
spectacularly well done video on fairly complex topics im new to machine learning in general and i want to learn more ill be watching your other videos on related topics next thank you,2
i always find it interesting that the statement logistic regression is a classification method is repeated so often despite regression being right there in the name like decision trees cart random forest and other similar methods there are both regression and classification versions of the method in a binary outcome problem we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads and p of coming up tails we can either predict p a continuous value between and or we can predict the outcome itself which is in the former is regression the latter is classification logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff sometimes but not always to predict the outcome many times the probability is more important for example lots of the same type of customer you do not want to assume all of them are s when p is estimated to be and sometimes the outcome is more important for example making a decision to approve an application for credit,1
im taking a machine learning course and this is what i needed to completely understand each method great video concise and easy to follow thanks,2
it may surprise some people but logistic regression is in fact a regression model the output is continuous its a probability of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output so the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut,1
you can also get multiclass classification where the output is more then also you can use neural networks for classification also,1
amazing content straight to the point whilst still being detailed,2
i love how the explanation is made to everyone with experience or not in this issue i m in the second group and now i have a reference to start thank you,2
great it gives an overview of the subject and acts as a roadmap to dive deeper into the study of ml,2
muchas gracias video muy ilustrativo concreto y preciso para tener un panorama de los modelos de aprendizaje autom tico ml,1
this is awesome package your stuff into a udemy teaching course that rewards you for all this shared knowledge and wisdom about ml,2
if machines are so good at learning maybe they can start teaching soon,2
step dont be afraid of math,1
chillest programming channel ive ever stumbled upon good shit bro keep it up,2
step embrace mathematics step master python computer science fundamentals step start mathematical modelling and take up projects step be patient and above all dont loose hope,2
woah this video was epic i think the work youre doing here is really important i try to stop myself from slipping into the ol zarg langauge on the daily glad to know im not alone in our fight i think they have some sort of brain infiltration device or something,2
im so happy i found this video and your channel this was so useful for me i thought i was the only one who felt andrew ng was speaking zarglar after the first couple of modules youve inspired me to try again with the tryget stuckresearch and repeat method thanks,2
thank you i think my education goes well with ml or ai i got a degree in psychology neurobiology focus math and cs just started pursuing python once more to go into data science,2
you did a great job introducing the how to learn aspect of what i think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners basically when you explained when i saw this i didnt know what it meant so i googled it that is crazily enough a big lesson to learn just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff so of course thanks for the video,2
this may be the best youtube tutorial ever making the process of learning this entertaining is fantastic i had to go about it in the same way and i wish there had been a video like this years ago sending this to my son thanks,2
i had the same exact problem when i started learning too much jargon and not enough explaining the tutorial series by a channel called giantneuralnetwork was great because he teaches you not only the theory but also how to actually code a simple neural network he does it very visually and it is very well done,2
very insightful i learned a lot thank you,2
now thats interesting i had been seeing devops all the time on this channel and now its time to put ml dl and ds stuffs,2
interesting and knowledgeable presentation,2
thanks for super simple explanation,2
very nice overview thanks,2
is there any toolproduct in ibm which i can use to ingest various types of data who provides me builtin machine learning algo to predicts actionable insights based on pattern without spending anything for certain time or size of data i really believe ibm is way advance in aiml than any other big players but its just how you market it,2
i guess you cant teach selfdriving cars using rl in the real world punishing them if they collide would be a little too late so i would guess that rl is used only in lab simulations and then later in the real world these systems are only performing the task without actively using rl do i get it right,0
nice summary,2
it seems all the good teachers are lefthanded i hope i can be one too,2
weldone luv awesome presentation,2
seriously this plugin kite is awesome and saves you a ton of time plus its free try it out,2
repeat with me dont skip the math,1
steps of getting started with machine learning get excited about machine learning learn birds eye topics and think you understand machine learning learn more about math and realize you dont understand machine learning realize no one understands machine learning,1
thank you for the recommendations i m really into ai programming and i want to leave my truck driver job to start as a programmer i ve working with that about five years ago even been i am definitely going for it,2
this was awesome as someone who is still only recently introduced into the cs field and interested in perhaps dabbling in mlai this was really helpful for people like me thank you,2
the most surprising thing for me is that i have always been interested in ai but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through i ended up taking a fundamentals to data science class this semsester and it taught me much of the basic ai algorithms that you mentioned i guess luck is on my side lol,2
also it may be wise to learn matlab to a fairly advanced level before doing ml the jump from basic python to ml is quite a big one i was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it you must know how to populate matrices by row and column take the average etc a basic python course wont cover these things but matlab courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist,0
hey tim good video one thing i would say is that i wouldnt recommend beginners to start with reinforcement learning as a matter of fact i think thats one of the more advanced applications supervised learning with neural nets or computer vision would be my suggestions before going to reinforcement,2
you re an amazing speaker and explain concepts very well thanks for your invaluable videos,2
really liked the stepbystep breakdown of the process the whole video was very informative,2
laurence thank you so much for taking the time to put out such concise intuitive walkthroughs you manage to make everything going on behind the curtain really accessible and unintimidating,2
nice explanation i am also building a course on ml in python for a university more from an implementation perspective this surely helps,2
i love these tutorials and videos that tensorflow puts out super informative thank you laurence what a great video you bet ill keep watching these series have a fantastic day everyone,2
subscribed after watching this love the way you explain you explain the concept very clearly and also you add a little bit of the code which gives me a great preparation for the coding application keep up the good work lawrence,2
hey there lawrence really good explanation thanks for putting together just wanted to ask how often these vids will come out,2
thank you for explaining this so clearly and eloquently,2
great explanation i loved the way you explained it im excited to see more,2
was just waiting for this from lawrence i m learning machine learning daily and time to take this to next level thanks lawrence and google and tensor flow,2
extremely helpful explanation thank you very much,2
this video is soo good i watched this many times to understand what ml is i studied matlab at university this video is also good for review of ml,2
i have launched my own start up in celebration of that we are giving away in crypto make sure to enter the metacent giveaway,2
you should learn machine learning even if you dont intend to be a machine learning engineer ml is a tool an important one that can help make sense from data in the future knowing how to use ml as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use excel today it doesnt mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesnt know how to use one,2
ml reminds me big datas hype few years ago some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it so they wanted to train themselves puting an hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing it just allows to solve some problems and not all in a more efficient way than other methods i think people in tech industry should all learn what ml is what it can do hardware requierments and what gains it can provide so they can know if they really need it then maybe they should learn it in depth but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements i learnt how to make train and use neural networks years ago as part of my academical training did i make nn since then no did i have used libs or services relying on nn yes quite often thats quite a different thing,1
well as someone who likes research in ai i give major credit to software engineer the math is pretty intense to always remember so software engineers are very good at making black boxes that are reusable so i think everyone in technology is just as important,2
i absolutely agree with you from my experience toward my research machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features however if you are extracting features from unknown observation then modelbased approach is very useful these days a hybrid between modelbased approach and machine learning techniques are useful,2
great video smitha i have been working as a developer for about a year now and i just landed a job as a data scientist i m hoping to transition into ml in a few years,2
thank you for the honest talk the more i learn about machine learning the more i realize that what you say is true at the same time everyone is different some people will simply do anything to work in ml and thats okay,2
i took an introductory crash course and some of the simple projects that we did were so cool that i want to learn more about ml and make more exciting projects thanks for guidance,2
thank you for the info however i think this advice applies to just about every career especially in the fast changing world we are in even accounting has to be looked at,2
wow massive learnings thanks i wonder if you wouldn t mind discussing the kind of limitations a hobbyist would face what kind of projects are possible,2
i have been studying deep learning for the last weeks or so and this guy explained it like in minutes i wish i had a teacher like him,2
there should be a button of mega like for this video great explanation of an epic tool thanks a lot,2
the best explanation of convolution in few minutes,2
this is an amazing smooth intro to a relatively complicated topic the qr codes are a smart move hoping to see more videos on similar topics thank you both,2
wow ive been reading about this stuff a lot but always had difficulty wrapping my head around it i did the tensorflow demos but was unable to understand it well enough to try something on my own he explained it very clearly and cleaned up a lot of my misunderstanding thank you so much for sharing,2
i cant even tell you how much more i enjoy using tensorflow than i did using the previous versions thank you for all the great improvements a special thank you for tensorboard a very useful and fun tool,2
laurences explanations were wonderful thorough but also simple enough that even a newbie can understand it thank you,2
wow this was an awesome presentation ill focus on the first speaker since i was somewhat familiar with the subject i also liked the second one he explained all of the key concepts as clearly as i have seen and i have looked at a lot of videos this is a master class in how to do it i hope he presents on many more related topics definitely worth watching thank you so much,2
amazing video theres many elements here that are explained so well looking forward to doing more stuff with tf in the future,2
i wish i had watched this a year ago easy to understand with great details thank you sir,2
if you dont know calculus thats ok continues to talk about calculus,1
this is the best quick explanation of machine learning i have seen to date you covered the first few weeks of the course extremely well and concisely i shared with all my friends to get them more hyped about machine learning,2
with gradient descent we generally dont update one parameter and then another rather parameter updates are done simultaneously great video overall i like how you started with a simple model structure and skipped the derivations to keep things understandable to a broader audience,2
hey it would be great if u could do a machine learning course for complete beginners here on youtube i really enjoyed this vedio thanks you so much for this,2
this topic is explained in depth in linear algebra,1
nice video hands down your channel has delivered the most useful information to me and my future not to mention interesting videos like this one ive been doing discrete math stuff and so its refreshing to learn about more continuous and applied math concepts,2
this is a great explanation of a very complex subject while incorporating and utilizing such a topic doesnt require an intense understanding of the process it does help to share the facts with others,2
thank you for your video i was wondering if youve done an electrical engineering degree would you have enough of the relevant math covered to go into machine learning artificial intelligence or would you need to take some extra classes im guessing statistics would be needed but what about everything else thank you again keep up the good work,2
i already took the coursera course but boi was this a good refresher also helps me as a cs major have a clearer idea of what math ill need to take thanks again,2
you did a phenomenal job explaining this thanks a lot,2
hey there happy new year speaking of the new year you might be wondering is this still valid for and the answer is yes its still valid for however you might notice a few changes to the websites mentioned throughout video some have had a design change including sites like made with ml whove recently pivoted all of the main concepts remain valid for the new year if anything changes drastically ill look to updatemake a new version of this video in the meantime happy machine learning,2
daniel you my friend are a legend its so good to see such passion and enthusiasm for your craft and the ml community is glad to have someone like you blazing a trail so that the new members can follow,2
presentations in the technical field such as this rarely have this much quality knowledge packed into them but its even rarer that they are this aesthetically pleasing,2
daniel thanks for this superb video as someone just starting out on this road its very easy to get sucked into the fine details but this has given me a much better grasp of the big picture i love your philosophy of not learning for learnings sake but using this knowledge to build things that matter to people keep doing what youre doing,2
hello daniel just wanted to say thank you for sharing your knowledge and resources i have been following you for weeks now and your channel is my favorite to learn about machine learning very inspiring and insightful thank you and keep up the good work mate cheers aymane,2
wow thank you for the incredible amount of work you put into this project it is truly an amazing creation very useful and relative information and the interactive map is really cool stupendous,2
now this is something else the best instructions to learning ml i have ever seen thank you daniel for the effort you put in this now i can really start to learn ml like a true legend thank you sir,2
ive never left a comment on youtube but i feel like i must do after watching this video it is very organized and useful to understand how we approach ml and keep learning it i appreciate you made this great one,2
this is gold thanks mate just about to begin my journey of learning data science and machine learning and this has definitely helped me to orient myself within the field all the best,2
daniel this is an amazing video i came back to say thank you for putting extensive work to make this video the map instructions and resources are super helpful this is the best guidance i have seen so far thank you daniel,2

this lecture is awesome and really inspiring ive been a fan now for years now lex and im really happy to see your success i just wanted to point out that i believe your analysis of one shot learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base the learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up this process takes usually between and years this time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible the process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,2
a great introduction lecture full of fruit i learned a lot in just a hour thanks a lot for sharing,2
this is great amazing lecture one question though about the baby walking isnt it very hard to quantify the data points synaptic firing a babies brain accesses when learning to walk if we dont fully understand the brain and neurological connection how do we quantify and compare the training data between the human brain and ai,2
thank you so much mr lex fridman for contribution and sharing your lectures,2
lex is a really admirable professor applying academy to solve real world problems through engineering ways kudos,2
absolutely amazing i love how you explained this,2
i started studying computer science i really never knew much about computer science i started in the first semester with a programming course and came across this video and i was fascinated by this now in the last semester i am writing my bachelorthesis in neural networks you were my inspiration,2
revisiting this video today this the video that got me into ai im a deep learning engineer today thanks sethbling cheers,2
this video was my first exposure to neural networks when i was in high school now i m a machine learning engineer at google,2
a year ago i used this video to explain to my class what artificial intelligence was or something like that i dont remember since i live in mexico i had to translate and explain everything thanks for the video i learned my classmates were entertained and i gave my teacher a good impression,2
that moment when you have taken machine learning and ai courses and you still have no idea how seth was able to do this,1
let s see if mario can complete the full game live on youtube,1
sethbling will make a sentient being using mario world code injection lol this whole stuff is super amazing love it d,2
few year back i watched this video as a newbie student and it give me a motivation to pursue ai as my career now im writing my master thesis and will soon join a company as machine learning engineer revising this video feels so nostalgic thanks sethbling kudos d,2
that is downright fascinating makes me wish i went into programming,2
this is undoubtedly one of the best precise and to the point tutorial videos on any learning site ive tried many videos but this has by far taught me the most thanks so much,2
thank you sir for providing such a comprehensive knowledge on ml algorithms i would like to share that the portion covered in this video is what is asked in most of the data analysis ml interviews this basics are the building blocks to grow upon,2
very nice im taking a machine learning class on coursrea and after watching this i understand more of how to implement the algorithms the class actually got me confused on how to apply it to daily tasksprojects now i have some projects in mind d,2
as always great quality lectures by simplilearn thank you,2
hello sir thank you for this great tutorial can you send me the datasets for more practice please thank you in advance,2
thank you so much for this wonderful online turtorial i am a beginner to ml and this tutorial are so helpful may i ask where can i get the data that has been used in this video for practice thank uuuu,2
thank you siryour team is doing so good for the purpose of helping studentslove respect for simple learning team,2
very well explained very good video for beginners i highly recommend thank you so much for explaining in detail the pace is absolutely perfect,2
this is really a good video for starters in machine learning thank you for it it would be really helpful if you could share the datasets used in the examples for selfpractice i dont prefer to share my email id here in public chat please advise on alternatives to share my email id for datasets thank you,2
register and get free certificate for the course topics covered agenda introduction to python and anaconda introduction to pandas and data manipulation introduction to numpy and numerical computing data visualization statistics vs machine learning types of statistics understanding data what is reinforcement learning reinforcement learning framework qlearning case study on smart taxi,1
started this video casually and got stuck to it for hours eventually gonna finish the whole important course great information smoothly explained raghu raman,2
this is awesome theres absolutely no way im going to watch this right now but its great to see this quantity and quality of information posted for public benefit im subscribing and sharing,2
hi op my question is regarding the challenge of dealing with datasets in my project the feature set contains about columns from merging csv files to train my model but the test dataset contains just columns including the target column so each time i try to make classification on the target column i get a failure notice telling me that my training and test shape are not the same how can i make my model to make prediction based on the test dataset given to me or how can i adapt my test dataset to conform to the training dataset in shape in order to run my program,0
thats a fantastic video i dont watched full but the way he taught is absolutely amazing it will very beneficial if the videos are of hour length and divided in playlist so that if a person dont have enough data balance can download one chunk at a time it is very difficult to watch the video of this length at a time,2
agenda introduction to python and anaconda introduction to pandas and data manipulation introduction to numpy and numerical computing data visualization statistics vs machine learning types of statistics understanding data what is reinforcement learning reinforcement learning framework qlearning case study on smart taxi,1
thank you so much for the informative lectures better than many college level courses but how can we get an access to the notebooks,2
great introduction just one point at tuple for single column is passed in wrong way and thats why it returned data series it should be dflocstart instead of dflocstart to get the dataframe as in pyhton brackets are used for expressions or for functions will be evaluated into and start will be evaluated into string start and thus when there is single element in a tuple it must be represented with comma at the end,1
loved your content very much learned by practicing with automotive related data being a mechanical engineer lot of hurdles faced though but that is how you learn i say would appreciate a complete lecture of this particular session where entire ml is taught checked your playlist of ml are those continuation of these classes would appreciate your quick response how can i utilize ml in manufacturing auto sector in india since want to be in core also work on technological advancement using software since i like both the streams lot of questions though would like to get response,2
thanks mr raghuraman you really covered the basics as they should be this is the way to cover the pg course on python thanks a lot,2
im amazed by seeing your understanding with every algorithm one day ill also be able to do the same,2
sir make a separate playlist on reinforcement learning deep reinforcement learning and imitaiton learning thanks,1
thank you for this wonderful session can we have slides of this session,2
sir i just want to say thank you to help us gain this knowledge and encourage us to start our data science journey,2
clear information clarify every important point cover all topics thanks krish i participated you live session also,2
excellent sessioneverything about ml is summarised in a single video which provides the complete picture of the elephant,2
your explanation is really good and content wise excellent sir thanks for sharing your videos and roadmaps and end end explanation interview point of view,2
perfect binge watch for interview preparation thanks for uploading this krish,2
hi krish we have pycaret library which you have shown in one of your video then is it advisable to use or we need to create individual model and compare them and finalise one kindly advise,1
thank you for putting everything together,2
minutes in and i can say im not frightened of ai im frightened of the motives of those who control it we should all have our own personal decentralised ai,1
when i was little we were memorizing multiplication and division tables these kids are learning about neural networks,1
i am i wish i had had the education those kids were getting the string activity was awesome to understand how connected we are,2
insightful film also loved how all the characters were brought together at the end,2
if you really dig in deeper to find ais and machine learning reaching capabilities then theyre really greater than us but always in specific sense they doesnt posses capability to be more general like human but they outperform humans by incredible power in given specific tasks,2
it is not a question if ai is good or bad it is a question of using it in a good or bad way another thing is many people resist change of any type resisting change means that those people will be totally unable to cope when the change becomes everywhere,0
if the old guy is my grandfather i think we would be talking about technologies all day long nice video,2
love it thats why i teach kids between and how to code educating the next generation,2
technology looks beautiful in a documentary when you try to learn its a job,2
with great power comes great responsibility great documentary but im afraid this superpowerful technology will be used for evil purposes as well as always in human history,0
learn math learn python learn data preparation learn ml libraries practice and practice,1
im just getting started with machine learning and this is a very helpful and motivating video thanks xx,2
hey smitha thanks a lot for this great piece of advicei am currently an data analytics intern at ey i hope you make more videos on this and other useful resources,2
hello mam im a firstyear engineering student and since class th i had an interest in mlai i already know python and math topics like linear algebra vectors matrices since they are already in my engineering as well jee course so can you please suggest some more skills that i need to learn,1
thank you smitha i have been pondering over ml not knowing from where to start you have provided a good starting point i really appreciate it,2
this is a great video something i enjoyed was the background not too much to get distracted by and you had a good presentation,2
hello i am not yet an ml enthusiast but clicked on the video because of the slight curiosity i have about it but the nozero days mention makes sense is a good reminder that such consistency is important for achieving ones goals,2
thankyou for this video this is really so amazing i just didnt even think that way to look at what companies want from us but either way i am going to learn it for just fun but maybe later on i would like to switch my carrier in it thankyou,2
i have just started to look into ml and learn more about it and this video is an absolute motivator thanks subscribed,2
i think math is important because if you are trying to solve a problem with ml you need to at least or have an idea of what each mathematical conceptformula are going to solve and perfect for your problem,2
hi all thanks for watching hope this course has given you a solid foundation in the world of computer vision be sure to check out my channel and connect with me on social media jasmcaus for more great content twitter youtube,2
i watched a lots of deep learning tuturials before this some of them were even twice as long as this and yet this explained the best and the most thank you for the awesome tutorial without ads for free you are a hero,2
this was such a great refresher course everything i needed to recollect and on point great job and thank you,2
this is honest to god a great lecture and perfect for introducing deep learning i hope there s another video in the future that shows some light programming,2
it was a good introductory course although theres lack of examples in the explanation of neural network part but overall you can get the idea of how deep learning works,2
this was such a great refresher course everything i needed to recollect and on point great job and thank you,2
excellent introduction to the topic great slides great explanation right pace really good,2
awesome video jason youve helped make this information accessible to thousands of new people,2
short and crisp overview of deep learning with cool intuitions this is the only video that i will recommend to anyone who wants to start with deep learning and even machine learning in general,2
great video i like the structure and the depth of knowledge shown in it,2
this would be substantially more terrifying if the bots werent drawn to be so cute,0
the true existential crisis comes when you realise he just described evolution in general we can recreate it we benefit from it yet we have no clue why or how its actually working beyond luck,0
when grey was talking about the warehouses and slaughterhouses all i could do was think of star wars the bots are basically equivalent to clones on kamino i would say the bots are less sentient but the way grey has depicted them makes that less certain and the comparison all the stronger,0
the topology of the learning network is based on that of the perceptron built in the s with relays in the end the network conduct a converging weighting of probabilities to identify the correct event yes even a picture is considered an event a static one though a dinamic event is defined by using vector spaces thank you for the nice video,2
this is absolutely insane i love this video and the way it explains everything though i guess that isnt specific to this video,2
teacher bot cant teach but it can test did you just explain the entire american school system,0
checking in again after a google engineer claimed their lamda ai was sentient this isnt the type of machine learning that ai uses but still fascinating,2
as a comp sci student i find it interesting how you explained this but rather than teaching i would more describe it as evolution you know like only the strongest or most fit for whatever task survive till the next generation just like in real life birds might not know why they fly south only that they do so every year same with the bots and their tasks i think explaining this way at least for me is easier because bots don t learn they evolve through the generations,1
this was so helpful im currently trying to teach my pit amiibo how to fight properly and this is going to help me big time in training it,2
you re such a great teacher all the bots look sooo cute as well and comprehensible graphics like always d,2
at times i feel so lucky being born in this age of internet otherwise it was no way possible for me to learn from this legend of machine learning for free looking at this career across academia and industry he is a pioneer it like learning integral calculus from newton himself,2
i just love how humble and friendly this prof is big fan,2
i am a thgrade student and really interested in machine learning i did some basic math which is required in machine learning and am starting with this course today i really liked the fact that the language which is used in this course is python so excited to learn about this new branch will try my best to complete it thank you stanford for uploading these lectures,2
andrew ng is a legend i took his course on coursera and i wish the course never ended i have taking a lot of machine learning courses but none of them compare to andrews he made complex concepts look trivial and established a theoretical background intuition as he would say,2
the way this man teaches is something which doesnt get you tired you will watch him teach with a beaming smile on your face thanks for this great class,2
thank you for the course its very helpful for me,2
in todays time andrew ng is legend by his ml knowledge,2
lecture wellposed learning problem is said to learn from experience e with respect to some task t and some performance measure p if the performance on t as measured by p improves with experience e see not that complex,1
very nice lecture,2
excelente clase saludos desde per,1
love that they repeat the question before answering its hard to follow online classes when some students ask something and you only get the answer,1
this is so great for making these valuable ressources completely free to us would you consider uploading courses for civil engineering department thank you,2
so nice lectures and professors wish to attend a real lecture at mit,2
excellent for a newbie thanks for the great effort to cover all the basis in simple but still reasonably indepth way,2
this is a great video for overview of ai and ml will stay tuned for upcoming videos in this course thanks mit ocw,2
wow so glad yall posted this exactly the field im trying to learn,2
thanks a lot for describing such a big comprehensive ai information in such a way that i can easily see and understand the forest of ai especially machine learning,2
this is so exceptional and simplified am so grateful for this,2
its not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning sometimes you want to limit your dataset for example if youre trying to figure out if youre in a stock market recession or expansion you dont want to go over years months of data because youll end up in another cycle symmetry and domain limits are important in machine learning my point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0
thanks a lot mit if it is possiblecould you make the videos of complex variable with applicationsi really want to watch that coursethank you very much,2
correction i say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called variance however i should have said that the difference is a consequence of variance technically variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set support statquest by buying my book the statquest illustrated guide to machine learning or a study guide or merch,1
lol what a way to present dry material with a dry approach yet making it interesting and easy to follow great job,2
better than lots of courses on udemy i really like your humor,2
notes for myself def of bias the inability for a machine learning method to capture the true relationship is called bias def of variance the difference in fits between data sets is called variance,1
wow this was so straight to the point with great visuals that i managed to figure out all in one go great stuff,2
you just did it in a perfect way ive read blogs best ml books and other resources but you just nailed this thank you,2
i wish professors taught like this such clarity i am so thankful to you,2
i have watched many of joshs videos several times whenever i find myself trying to remember a concept i know that a statquest video will sort me out in minutes or less,1
this guy has united his two passions machine learning and guitar,2
so much of quality content on machine learning i wish i knew about this channel a bit before a must follow channel for ml ds enthusiasts great job josh please continue the good work and serve the humanity,2
make sure to enter the metacent giveaway,1
smitha i loved the layout of the video and appreciate the emphasis on book learning i am switching careers and want to emphasize ml and will follow the roadmap and let you know my thoughts much respect,2
hey smitha thank you for the road map humbly appreciate the time you put in making these videos for us all if i may ask there is another book that i have heard is great regarding machine learning titled handson machine learning with scikitlearn keras and tensorflow by oreilly please do advise on what you think about this one,2
just loved your content love the effort you put in every single video like its just wow keep creating the good content love,2
thank you for an insightful video i am currently leading a team of data analysts and planning to get started on some ml projects in the team do you have any input on how a team manager can prepare to lead a team of ml engineers any pointers will be great thank you,2
wow congratulations for starting such an amazing project,2
wow smitha you did amazing job feel proud of you,2
i am just getting started on machine learning and this roadmap is a muchneeded one thanks for creating this much appreciated,2
loved your recommendations i didn t knew the deep dive book looks amazing thanks,2
i love this content and vibe of the channel thank you,2
part will be on backpropagation i had originally planned to include it here but the more i wanted to dig into a proper walkthrough for what its really doing the more deserving it became of its own video stay tuned,2
im only minutes into this video right now but i just wanted to say how much i appreciate the time and spacing you give to explaining a concept you add pauses you repeat things with slightly different wording and you give examples and zoom in and out linking to relevant thought processes that might help trigger an aha moment in the viewer many of these hooks actually make me understand concepts ive had trouble grasping in maths all because of your videos and the way you choose to explain things so thanks youre helping me a lot to become a smarter person,2
dissapointed you did not animate a dimensional graph would make things easier,0
im an it student and we have an assignment on exactly this topic we even have to use the mnist data set i have to say this is absolutely lifesaving and i can not thank you enough grant what you do here is something that only a handful of people on this planet can do explain and visualize rather complicated topics beautifully and simple so from me and a lot of students all around the globe thank you so so much,2
unlike most teachers of subjects like this this gentleman seems to be genuinely concerned that his audience understands him and he makes a concerted and highly successful effort to convey the ideas in a cogent digestible and stimulating form,2
you sir deserve a noble or an oscarwhat an incredibly effective method of teaching thank you so very much no bad computer made me crack up lol,2
one of youtubes highest quality content channels chapeau,2
i just sat through a day ml accelerator class and you series did a far better job at explaining them with twenty minute videos well done mate really appreciate it thank you,2
hands down i have never seen anyone explain mathematics so beautifully the way he does kudos,2
thank you blue brown for these videos theyre extremely instructive however theres one point that i didnt understand why does the gradient descent algorithm struggle to find local minimas with swapped labels if anyone could answer my question id be very grateful thank you,2
i feel this is one of the best courses ive ever seen on machine learning i was looking for something like this for months now to my surprise this course just released conveniently just before my spring break thank you guys,2
supervised learning unsupervised learning reinforcement learning,1
thanks for your knowledge sharing sir required reinforcement learning i hv subscribed just now,2
please also provide chapters so that one can go directly to the topic heshe wants,1
thank you very much for the great effort i want a video about a project ml complete to understand how it works in real life,2
hi i want to request for the datasets used in the course,1

thank you instructor for this awesome video you explained very thing in quite simple and easily understandable manner,2
omg such awesome day to day life examples given for perfect understanding completely mesmerized,2
this is really helpful for preparing and facing the job interviews thank you for the video,2
very helpful and interesting video and covers almost all the areas with clear explanations thank you so much for the efforts,2
thanks a lot for all the efforts nice explanation and good content for the realtime based questions,2
thanks for this video very neatly calmly explained the major ml terms,2
much gratitude for this informative lecture,2
for example if youre a developer and search for atom the search engine will show you the the atom ide instead of biological atom but if youre a biologist the search engine will show you the results about biological atom thats all because of machine learning and histories that search engine has about your interests,1
but this series is great you can repost it in the next time if possible please add subtitles to the video,2
kind of ai,1
steve is a phenomenal lecturer isnt he,2
just wanted to comment about how much i love these videos last year while applying for phds i was searching for passions in a discussion with my friend a computer scientist i accidentally outlined genetic programming without knowing it my friend told me so and i went researching found these videos and became enthralled now i have a phd studentship in soft robotics and plan to use sindy to help with modelling and control and honestly think that giving machines brains may be my future work too thanks brunton my passion was helped by your own,2
would love for a full series on how can we use rl to control real world dynamical systems,2
viewing reinforcement learning as time delayed supervised learning is a really good way of looking at it,2
i just cannot express how grateful i am to prof steve brunton for posting these videos waking up at am to watch him explain is the most satisfying thing ever thank you we all are grateful,2
great channel please record more videos on the edge of reinforcement learning and control theory congrats on your work,2
this sweet spot between control theory and machine learning definitely interests me especially applied to astrodynamical systems please continue making these videos professor brunton,2
i ve been following your content for a at least years now it s the reason i am a robotics control engineer now you pulled me through th year control systems with your convenientlytimed boot camp please keep up the great content ps are you accepting phd students,2
great video if everyone was as great on youtube as your delivery we would have a lot more passion in the area keep up the good work train on,2
thank you so much for this lecture i really enjoy your videos this is helpful as a phd student i also bought your book datadriven science and engineering which have nice explanations for the tools i use keep on this awesome work greetings from france,2
hi everyone exactly a week ago we conducted a contest in this video the answer to the question is given below the correct order of working for neural network with explanation b the weighted sum of inputs is calculated a the bias is added d the result is fed to an activation function c specific neuron is activated explanation in a neural network each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers these connections carry random weights the weighted sum of the inputs is calculated and an additional input in the form of bias is added w x b the result of this is fed to an activation function based on a particular threshold value only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value we are pleased to announce the lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz divya maskar kartik singhal michael ipinolu congratulations to all the winners theyve won an amazon voucher worth inr,1
thank you for this im curious about the statistical angle of the weighted sums and bias are these akin to regression coefficients and the bias associated with underfittingoverfitting that is adjusted with regularization in machine learning,1
b the weighted sum of input is calculated athe bias is added cthe specific neuron is added dthe result is feed to an activation function,1
first option b the weighted sum of the inputs is calculated second option a the bias is added third option d the result is fed to an activation function lastly option c specific neuron is activated,1
quiz sequence is b weighted sum of inputs is calculated a bias is added d the result is fed to activation function c specific neuron is activated,1
order badc working of a neural network the weighted sum of the input is calculated the bias is added the result is fet to an activation function specific neuron is activated nice video it helped me to learn deep learning in minutes,2
answer the weighted sum of the inputs is calculated b the bias is added a the result is fed to an activation function d specific neuron is activated c,1
bweighted sum of inputs is calculated abias is added dresult is fed into activation function cspecific neuron is activated,1
the sequence is b the weighted sum of inputs is calculated athe bias is added dthe result is fed to activation function c specific neuron is activated,1
thank you so much for your presentation i have learned a lot exercise test size c kernelpoly accuracy,2
hello great videos loved this series can you please do a video on imbalanced data sets in classifications problems maybe just add onto a previous example you have but with a case where there are very few or true values compared to or false thanks for you consideration,2
got score when c for iris data set thank you sir your machine learning playlist is a boon for beginners like me,2
hello sir thank you for your videos it really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist the model in default method is in train and in test whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from to therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model yet kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model thank you for your guidance,2
thank you very much for these videos they are really helpful i did the exercise and got when c any increase in c did not affect the accuracy also any alteration made to gamma and kernel dropped the accuracy drastically thank you once again,2
great sir can you elaborate something about plotting the hyperplane the decision function in matplotlib i want to see the best line which classifies the data,2
in linear kernel score is percent and in rbf kernel score is percent with gamma value the score is and with the regularization value the score is around percent,1
codebasics sir could you please make a video with regression models like knn regression or random forest with traintestvalidation set thank you for your amazing videosi started my machine learning implementation journey with your tutorials,2
what a wonderfull tutorial well done and well explained thanks a lot dude for the sharing of this expensive knowledge,2
hope you all enjoy this video go subscribe to ryans channel for more machinelearning content,2
the hard part about machine learning is not the how but the what i can plot learning curves very easily but reading them is another story thats why i like to focus my ml videos on the concepts rather than the code chances are that the code is doable in two lines but if you cant understand the output or why your data might give you certain kinds of output youre wasting time and resources,1
just about to finish my first year studying statistics a short course was about machine learning so i have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video we got to use and tweak different types of predictor models we split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data which included the outcome variable to build the models and the test data which didnt include the outcome variable to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable,2
good interview but as someone who has already know the concept of data science and machine learning im actually interested to know what are the differences between a data scientist and a ml engineer hope this question will be answered in a future video,2
hey ryan or clement or both lol quick question if you had to place these in certain categories for their specific useswhat each one excels at what categories would you put each of these machine learning frameworkstool kits tensor flow pytorch mxnet and hugging face in,1
thank you clement we need more interviews with ml engineers in your channel,2
i really hope ryan starts a machine learning podcast or something its something i can pay for,2
hi i have a question i am currently doing a master in mathematics with a focus on ml and statistics but mostly theoretical how could i transition to becoming an ml engineer is it enough to learn how to implement these models in python or is there something else,1
i believe that machine learning should be used more selectively than it is now,1
great interviewlearnt lot of thingsi have a questionis dsa so important to become a data scientist,2
thank you simplylearn for explaining machine learning in the most precise and ambient manner i have been wanting to learn machine learning since a long back and today i scouted for your video this seriously helped me learn the basics of machine learning once again thank you so much,2
i must thank sl team for the video absolute helpful for a layaman to understand i have queries regarding the course let me know how shall i contact,2
thank you so much this was very informative and very well explained,2
thanks one more time for the richful tutorial and the explanations provided i did the exercise consisting to predict the prices of the house from th boston housing dataset it works as explained in the video i just have few questions concerning the training test and prediction indeed what guide the right choice of the traintestsize and randomstate values in my code i changed the testsize value to and the randomstate to i got a nice prediction for arrays but not for array for example and when i compute the mean squared value i get can such a value be acceptable thank you again for all,2
absolutely awesome thanks for the video would be great to see next implementation of any ml algorithm,2
wow i was wanting this type of video only in which i could revise all the basics of machine learning thank you so much for uploading this,2
nice tutorial kindly upload more related to implementation demo of supervised and unsupervised learning,2
hey this video really made me catch my understanding of what is machine learning is i referred to tons of different videos i am able to understand kind of but not meaningfully but this video gave me the complete meaning of machine learning to understand deep practically,2
great video thank you one question in the mail filtering first example of the naive bayes theorem what event does a refers to thanks,2
hello how are you from my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic however if you want to reach an even wider audience considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak english i suggest to associate the subtitles even if in english as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery that the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language thanks for the attention thanks for the video and i wish all success to the simplilearn team,2
ai vs ml vs dl vs ds machine learning types of ml supervised ml regression intro brief classification brief unsupervised ml clustering brief dimentionality reduction first algo linear regression,1
lot of respect sir cant thank you enough for these live sessions,2
sir a lot of respect to you excellent session,2
superb sir i thoroughly enjoyed of learning machine learning your energy and practical way of teaching makes more eagerness towards learning data science,2
sir thank you for this great job please sir i have a question are we to always assume theta one while finding the gradient descent curve thank you so much i love the way you split everything for us you are so much,2
amazing explanation i loved the way you taught,2
sir i have a question as the r square adjusted always decreases with the increase in predictors how can we be sure that it is not ignoring features that are actually correlated,1
please also cover other important topics like ldapca tsne etc a lot of good companies ask these questions and test the indepth understanding of the candidates krish naik,1
thank you sir for such amazing community classes,2
excellent st session excited to do the nd part tomorrow i am trying to revise my ml knowledge to get back to competing in kaggle,2
idk if you realise the intensity of positive impact you are making in many peoples life thank you so much sir for what youre doing,2
excellent resource sir can you please explain all the sub fields in ai ml dl like nlp computer vision etc any other major part that i dont know even in software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers like for web development frontend technologies are same html css js for backend one may choose a programming language php node js aspnet and a database again for mobile developers they may choose android ios or cross platform react native flutter with database knowledge apis basic knowledge on how web works my question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev can an ai ml engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only nlp engineer knows very less about computer vision or computer vision engineer knows very less about nlp,2
all i want to say that you are a blessing and i commend your dedication and effort even coming from a phd in computer engineering your materials have helped me a lot i wish you the best in all your endeavors,2
i was searching all around the internet for something like this most i found are saying that we need to start with insert ml related topic here but i felt that something was missing when you started by saying that a good ml engineer should first be a good software engineer i knew right away that this is whats missing it makes complete sense to start there and then move up the ladder thank you for taking the time to creating all of this,1
hey there firstly i cant thank you enough for starting this channel im here after i saw your video about how to pick up the basic skills to become a data analyst in months video and want to let you know that i had started the google data analytics course on coursera about days ago and have finished courses in the certificate series do you think it is possible for me to pick up the same skills you mentioned in your video through this course do you think the google badge on the certificate might give it an edge i honestly feel the pathway you described in your video takes a more in depth approach which might be beneficial would really really love to hear your thoughts on this it would really mean a lot if you replied thank you,2
hi sir could you recommend us the resources for additional skills you mentioned as well,1
thank you so much for all that you do sir they are extremely helpful,2
thanks for your time and effort the way you have designed and presented is awesome you made many peoples life easier thanks again,2
this channel is such a blessing and a goldmine of quality content also loved the soothing background music,2
i would also like to point out that actually understanding machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics as was mentioned as a benefit being part of something will be extremely difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability statistics in fact at my university in order to enrol in the first machine learning course you need to have taken semesters of calculus with proofs as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops one or two courses in linear algebra and courses in statistics that s not to say it s impossible to use ml without that of course it isn t however it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge much more so than with required programming knowledge for ml so yes you will be a part of something in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with but it s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ml publications at a meaningful level or be generating their own custom models,1
in my eyes the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml in many cases i would eagerly wait for about hours for the model to train to see it not work at all in the way i intended id keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the code to see its performance not getting better at all,0
pros it is fun cons you have to work don t thank me,1
tim always posts videos on topics that i am currently practicinghave in mind these coincidences happens so much its scary lol love your vids,2
im taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at years old and that makes k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a or indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip hours or pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python,1
im a data scientist and of my job is data collection and preparation its still a cool job but its not all model development,2
at first i thought i will learn machine learning in months with some coding experience i dedicated hours on normal day and hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in months and guess what in reality it took me year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field first to learn data structures and algorithms programming logic then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search reverse linked list string manipulation this will help you so much to improve coding skills the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way second learn some basic calculus and statistics linear algebra probability dot product gradient descent third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills,1
the only thing holding me back is that it took about mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around numbers on a powerful laptop it was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases it might go on for even a week with gpus it pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company this video didnt give any valuable inputs to make a decision,0
imo machine learning is a lot of math it is very difficult to find an interesting job without advance degree if it is the goal of learning ml,1
tim you should post more about machine learning also please try to make a video on how to use the model for production it will be really helpful,2
me result tan inspirador conocerte hayd me estoy amigando con las matem ticas para poder profundizar m s en estos temas,2

i really enjoyed this conversation with andrew heres the outline introduction first few steps in ai early days of online education teaching on a whiteboard pieter abbeel and early research at stanford early days of deep learning quick preview deeplearningai landingai and ai fund deeplearningai how to get started in deep learning unsupervised learning deeplearningai continued career in deep learning should you get a phd ai fund building startups landingai growing ai efforts in established companies artificial general intelligence,2
i have a phd in ai and i can say that andrew is the best machine learningai educator i have ever seen on the field the deeplearning specialization is just invaluable for any interested learner in dl,2
one of the people that inspired me to do artificial intelligence in areas that matter without coursera i would have not gotten where i am today thank you for this conversation lex,2
whenever someone uses the word it turns out i remember andrew ng i love andrew ng,2
when someone else allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bit its a great time to be alive when people like you lex and andrew share your knowledge with the world simply to help them a little bit i believe the little bits will make the world a better place,2
as a genxer i enjoyed this interview so much it made me actually feel like i was experiencing the internet we were promised decades ago a well thought out and intelligent conversation that in the end leaves the viewer in a state better than when they first pressed the play button well done,2
i took ngs class on coursera years ago it switched my career trajectory from academic to industry and spurred my interest in making things awesome to see this interview,2
this man got a great voiceover career available at anytime,2
this week has been awesome first scott aaronson and now andrew ng lex itd be really cool if you could get someone working on the theoretical aspects of machine learning like sanjeev arora ankur moitra or costis daskalakis itd be super interesting to see the conversation between experts on two different sides of the same coin applied and theoretical,2
im a physician from brazil learning ai and this fine man helped me a lot thank you sir i salute you,2
machine learning is an incredibly powerful numerical tool man i love how far weve come technologically,2
you have the best way to describe what machine learning is i was wondering what its real meaning and i then found your answer in video i recommend all who dont know the meaning to see this video thanks oxford,2
great introduction question is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification for instance the ml algorithm uses the animals height length and face size as features for classification with computer vision being used to map images to these features do some ml algorithms create these features and features maps automatically or are these always created outside of the algorithm ps what did you use to create this video it looks great,2
i love the way you explained plus the diversity,2
ai is already here and that is not such a bad thing can computers become self aware yes i think so in the not too distant future,2
best explanation of machine learning,2
awesome succinct very effective for a newbie to understand the concept,2
well explanation love it,2
great animationkeep it up,2
thanks for sharing what is machine learning using such good animation,2
i am currently enrolled in a msc machine learning masters here in the uk and we are learning both the theory and putting it into practice using the assignments there really isnt a problem of doing it both stop telling yourself you cant if you put in the time and effort with the right learning mindset and method you can learn to eat and drink at the same time just need to be smart about it stop putting these limiting thoughts on yourself it really isnt that hard,2
i came for a machine learning related talk but i got a life lesson thanks daniel nice content ps i was thinking about going into ml field but i now realized its due to engineer disease im sticking with web apps at least for some time until i can decide what i love and what i dont,2
ive worked for about years with mlcomputer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated when i started out i was frustrated that i couldnt dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but i realized there are a lot of boring things that need to be in place before thats even relevant data curation annotation testing frameworks etc just to name a few there are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that i probably wouldnt even realize existed if i stayed in academia for a phd i think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning tools for the sake of tools and solving problems though as long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh,2
i come from a physics background and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can a lot of colleagues in my department dont understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop during my masters i realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects now that im finishing my masters and starting to get into ml engineering i see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want amazing content you put there mate thanks from brazil,2
back when i was learning to code i didn t know anything or what to do and how to do it i asked a friend of mine how i could what books i should read etc first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say you don t need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks you just need to know what is possible and that really reasonated with me because once you know what is possible you can think of a problem and as the video states learn by doing my friend said to work i m projects i want to solve or replicate and implement what i have learned that way rather than sitting around reading these books,1
i really like the point about engineering toolboxes i think that s where a lot of the burnout comes from i work in devops and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap learning how to build better ml pipelines are much more worth my time,2
i ve just started exploring this field and this was a really good reminder to get so early on the journey thanks a lot,2
excelente video con una pregunta filos fica profunda gracias por compartir esta reflexi n sobre la base de tu experiencia pregunta cu les son las tres herramientas framework data base and code writing de las que hablaste en el v deo que t usas,1
hey daniel just discovered your channel a couple days ago and im learning lots thank you,2
this is great focus is key a playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience for those interested in r and python the latest r studio ide is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate it can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in r and statistics you can run ml scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ,2
